WASHINGTON -- The spread of the coronavirus and related economic uncertainty is threatening to undermine the "phase one" trade agreement that the Trump administration signed with its Chinese counterparts less than two months ago.

President Trump, who repeatedly has criticized the U.S. trade deficit with China, made purchase commitments by China a core part of the deal, with Beijing expected to buy $200 billion in additional American exports over two years. An extra $77 billion is required in 2020 and $123 billion in 2021.

Yet, the virus's spread has hurt Chinese economic demand and trade, and the ensuing drop in global-energy prices and weakness in the transportation sector make it unlikely China will be able to make good on the dollar commitments in the deal, economists and trade experts say.

On Monday, the Center for Strategic and International Studies released a report saying that the purchase targets already were overly ambitious -- and that the coronavirus has worsened the situation.

"Not only are the numbers unrealistic, but they're unreal," said Scott Kennedy, China expert at the nonpartisan Washington think tank. "The likelihood of even just reaching last year's exports is unlikely."

Trump administration officials previously acknowledged that the coronavirus-related problems may delay expected purchases by China this year, but said Chinese President Xi Jinping had assured Mr. Trump the country would meet its obligations.

Trade experts have pointed to a clause in the deal that allows for consultations "in the event that a natural disaster or other unforeseeable event outside the control" of the countries delays implementation.

The office of U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, which is responsible for implementing the agreement, said it "has had no conversations like this with our Chinese counterparts."

"We expect that the Chinese will meet their commitments under the agreement," a spokesman for Mr. Lighthizer said. The Chinese embassy in Washington didn't respond to a request for comment.

"China realizes very clearly there is a lot of skepticism on the U.S. side on whether they will follow through and they are doing all they can to put that to rest," said Clete Willems, a law partner at Akin Gump and former Trump administration trade official.

Mr. Trump has been generally complimentary of China's handling of the crisis, a characterization that is at odds with some fellow Republicans, who have questioned whether China has been transparent.

A Republican with close ties to the administration believes Mr. Trump is proceeding carefully to avoid giving Beijing an excuse to back out of its commitments. "He thinks that if he starts beating up China they are going to stiff him," this person said. The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.

Current and former administration officials have tended to be optimistic about Beijing's ability to catch up on the requirements of the pact, noting that Mr. Xi has enormous influence over state-owned enterprises that could purchase American aircraft, energy products and farm goods.

Still, the deal's reliance on state-led firms to purchase U.S. products -- often with expensive and enduring tariffs that make them less attractive -- brings its own set of problems, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, another Washington think tank.

"It will be hard enough for China to meet this commitment as it stumbles through an economy now afflicted by the coronavirus disease," economists Chad Bown and Mary Lovely said last week.

China on Saturday posted a 4% drop in imports in the first two months of the year, compared with a year earlier. Still, the country's pork, soybean and natural-gas imports grew.

U.S. officials have been touting other aspects of the deal, including Beijing's moves to open up to American chicken exports and pave the way for better protection of intellectual property in China. The emphasis on purchases in phase one differed sharply from recent Washington trade pacts, which typically prioritize lifting barriers to facilitate freer, market-based trade.

Mr. Lighthizer and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue are expected to announce Tuesday further progress in implementing the deal, including opening its markets to California nectarines and lifting bans on beef from older cattle.

In addition to the purchases, China agreed to discourage theft of trade secrets and safeguard intellectual property in the phase-one accord, among other pledges.

At a recent rally, Mr. Trump said the U.S. economy remains strong, but is "nothing compared with what it's going to be when the trade deals kick in." Still, the bigger shifts in economic rules that officials had hoped Beijing would agree to were left for future negotiations.

UAW Probes Sexual-Harassment Claims

The United Auto Workers has hired an outside lawyer to investigate allegations that a member of the union's executive board sexually harassed female staffers under his supervision, according to people familiar with the inquiry.

Two current female UAW staffers have alleged that Richard Rankin, a regional director who holds a powerful position on the union's governing board, repeatedly made sexually charged remarks that in one instance escalated to a physical threat, the people close to the inquiry say.

UAW leaders have tapped an attorney from the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Bredhoff & Kaiser PLLC to conduct an independent investigation into the women's claims, the people said.

The investigation began in January after a group of UAW-represented nurses filed a separate formal grievance to the union's board involving Mr. Rankin last fall that also contains allegations of sexual harassment, some of these people say.

The UAW confirmed to The Wall Street Journal in a statement that it has hired an outside attorney to investigate claims of discrimination and harassment in region 2B, the division overseen by Mr. Rankin, and that probe is ongoing. The union's statement didn't name Mr. Rankin.

"If we find that there was misconduct in the workplace, we will take appropriate corrective action," the UAW said.

Mr. Rankin, in an emailed statement, said: "I support and have fully cooperated with the investigation into this matter and with the investigation process."

The harassment allegations represent the latest challenge for UAW leaders, who are already grappling with a yearslong federal investigation into corruption that prosecutors say could result in federal oversight of the labor union.

The government's probe, which first became public in 2017, has led to the convictions of several former senior UAW officials, including three ex-board members.

The UAW has said it is enacting reforms, and that those charged in the probe violated the trust of its members.

On Thursday, federal prosecutors said they had charged former UAW President Gary Jones with conspiracy to embezzle more than $1 million from union funds. Mr. Jones, who resigned in November after leading a 40-day strike at General Motors Co., is the highest-ranking UAW official to be charged in the criminal probe.

An attorney for Mr. Jones declined to comment.

The two women have told the independent attorney the alleged incidents spanned a four-year period, starting in 2015, and that when they reported the claims to senior UAW officials, Mr. Rankin retaliated against them, people close to the inquiry say.

The UAW is separately reviewing the nurses' grievance, which alleges in part that Mr. Rankin, along with another male UAW official, "repeatedly sexually harassed and discriminated against" female leaders of the union local, according to a copy reviewed by the Journal.

The UAW is addressing those allegations through its formal grievance process, which is separate from the independent investigation, according to people familiar with the matter.

One of the nation's most prominent unions, the UAW represents roughly 400,000 active members, including factory workers at General Motors, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Ford Motor Co. While the 84-year-old union has its roots in the automotive business, it now represents workers in a broader array of industries, including higher education, health care and gambling.

UAW President Rory Gamble, who took over late last year, has pledged to root out financial and ethical wrongdoing at the union, including instituting reforms that he says aim to prevent the kind of financial misconduct uncovered by federal investigators.

A native of Youngstown, Ohio, Mr. Rankin was elected two years ago to lead the UAW's region 2B, which covers the states of Ohio and Indiana and represents workers at more than 50 companies, including all three Detroit auto makers. That role gives Mr. Rankin significant power on the union's executive board, where directors' votes are weighted proportionately to the number of workers they represent.

The UAW's executive board is a 13-member governing body, responsible for day-to-day operations of the union and executing on programs and policies approved by members.

In late 2017, then-UAW President Dennis Williams said: "Let me be very clear about this: the UAW has a policy of no tolerance -- zero tolerance -- when it comes to sexual harassment." He left the post in 2018.

The expanding federal corruption investigation, which in recent months has resulted in several high-level UAW officers pleading guilty to charges, has so far focused on instances of bribery, embezzlement, kickback schemes and other financial wrongdoing.

In the case of Mr. Jones, prosecutors say the ex-union president, along with other senior UAW officials, illegally used union funds to make lavish purchases, such high-end liquor and expensive cigars, as well as pay for golf outings and stays at luxury condos and villas.

Matthew Schneider, the U.S. attorney in eastern Michigan overseeing the case, said Thursday the investigation could result in federal oversight of the labor union -- a tactic the government used in 1989 with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. That oversight process ultimately led the Teamsters to undergo several governance changes that could serve as a model for the UAW, he added.

"We are not done, and we cannot predict exactly when we will be done," Mr. Schneider said of the investigation.

International Criminal Disgrace

Americans who believe in international institutions often lament that their countrymen don't appreciate the value of global cooperation. They'd have more credibility with more Americans if they called out anti-American outfits like the International Criminal Court.

Late last week the ICC revived a more than decade-old inquiry into alleged crimes committed by Americans and the Taliban in Afghanistan. It's a disgraceful example of moral and legal equivalence that equates Islamist insurgents who have killed thousands of Afghan civilians with the U.S., which ousted al Qaeda from Afghanistan, liberated millions of women, and has sacrificed much to rebuild the country.

The ICC came into force in 2002 with a mandate to investigate genocide and other crimes against humanity when a country is unwilling or unable to do so. But once created the institution took on a life and agenda of its own, focusing disproportionately on the U.S. and Israel. The court has produced few convictions, but dictators use it as a tool to prosecute opponents while remaining unscathed themselves. See Sudan's February announcement that it may turn over former dictator Omar al-Bashir.

The U.S. has never submitted to the court's jurisdictions. But Afghanistan joined in 2003, and now it's paying for that mistake. Coming days after Washington struck a deal to negotiate a peace agreement with the Taliban, the ICC's meddling is an especially unwelcome complication. The Taliban won't care what the ICC does, but an investigation could smear the elected Afghan government and the U.S.

"The ICC has today stumbled into a sorry affirmation of every denunciation made by its harshest critics over the past three decades," Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement. He's not exaggerating. The U.S. has threatened to revoke visas for anyone investigating U.S. citizens, and we hope it makes good on that promise.

The Coronavirus Epidemic: Covid-19 Close to Pandemic

The new coronavirus is now close to becoming a pandemic, the World Health Organization said Monday, a day in which global financial markets plummeted and Italian officials extended a lockdown for the entire country.

"We're reaching that point," Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies program, said in a Monday news conference. "We're very close."

The WHO generally defines a pandemic as a disease that has become widespread around the world. The viral epidemic reached a new stage globally Monday, with confirmed cases outside China tripling over the past week.

Stock markets around the world plunged, as a price war for oil and the coronavirus fallout frightened investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 2,000 points. Oil prices lost a fifth of their value.

Italy on Monday night curtailed the movement of people living up and down the entire country, a dramatic step to reduce the virus's spread as cases swelled. The nationwide lockdown permits only essential travel to, from and within Italy, beginning Tuesday morning, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said.

"I'm aware of how serious this is, but I am forced to intervene even more decisively to protect all of us, and especially those who are more weak and vulnerable," Mr. Conte said.

When applied to the flu, the word pandemic usually signifies that a virus has reached the point that it can't be stopped, the WHO said. But WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the new coronavirus can be stopped, even if the agency does declare a pandemic.

"The threat of a pandemic has become very real," he said. But, he said, "we shouldn't choose to live with it. We can win this battle."

Of 110 countries that have reported the disease, 79 have had 100 or fewer cases, Dr. Tedros said. He added that 43 countries have fewer than 10 cases.

In an indication of how quickly the epidemic has shifted, Chinese health authorities said Monday they planned to close the last of 14 facilities that were repurposed temporarily as hospitals in Wuhan in early February when the central Chinese city was overwhelmed with coronavirus cases, according to CCTV. Some of the patients have been discharged, while others have been transferred to other hospitals.

Total confirmed coronavirus cases rose Monday to 113,605, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. There were about 30,000 cases outside mainland China, versus around 10,000 a week ago. The U.S. tally grew to 605 cases, with at least 25 deaths.

Case numbers rose in Washington, New York and California, the three hardest-hit U.S. states, among other U.S. locales. King County public health officials reported three more deaths, all of whom were residents at the Washington nursing home at the center of the state's outbreak. Officials said there were 33 new cases, including two of these most recent deaths, in the county Monday.

In Santa Clara County, Calif., a woman in her 60s who was hospitalized for several weeks died Monday morning, becoming the state's second death.

Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. recommended employees in their New York offices work from home for most or all of March as cases of the virus increase in the city.

The number of positive cases in these hard-hit states has ballooned in recent days as testing capabilities and criteria expands. Louisiana and Ohio reported their first cases; at least 11 states have declared states of emergency, including Ohio, Illinois and Rhode Island.

Roughly 80% of Covid-19 cases tend to be mild or moderate -- and more than 63,000 people globally have recovered -- but those who are older or have underlying health conditions, such as lung disease or diabetes, are at a higher risk.

Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said those in higher-risk groups should consider stocking up on medication or household items and avoid crowds or unnecessary travel.

Meanwhile, five congressional lawmakers said they were placing themselves on self-quarantine after having contact with people who tested positive for the virus.

The White House said Monday that President Trump has not been tested "because he has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed COVID-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms." The White House said he remains in "excellent health, and his physician will continue to closely monitor him."

Vice President Mike Pence said that he hadn't been tested for coronavirus.

Carnival Corp.'s Grand Princess cruise ship docked in Oakland, Calif., on Monday, after staying off shore for days due to the virus. One former passenger died, becoming California's first Covid-19 death, and 21 current passengers, including 19 crew members, on the boat tested positive for the virus.

All on board will be quarantined.

As the ship headed to shore, passenger Helen Cloninger Curtis, 63-year-old from Helena, Mont., said she felt emotional. "Glad to get ashore," she said, "but nervous as to what is in store for us now."

Seventy-eight state and local public-health labs now have the capacity to run tests for Covid-19. Testing has been a bottleneck in the country's response so far, as kits were slow to roll out nationwide. Capacity to test and the criteria to test will likely vary by state, Dr. Messonnier said.

The world-wide death toll surpassed 4,000 -- the bulk of it in China, especially in the central city of Wuhan, which first reported the pneumonialike virus in December. Italy has the second-highest number of deaths at 463, and the total number of confirmed infections there climbed to 9,172, surpassing South Korea's 7,478 cases.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced sweeping restrictions on Monday requiring all arrivals on international flights to place themselves in quarantine for two weeks.

South Korean Vice Health Minister Kim Ganglip said the spread of the coronavirus appears to be slowing in the country but that new infections could come from people returning from abroad. The country added 165 cases, the lowest daily new numbers since Feb. 25, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Chinese health authorities reported 40 new cases on the mainland in the past day, bringing its total number of confirmed infections to 80,735, up about 1% from a week ago.

The Coronavirus Epidemic: Trump Weighs Payroll Tax Cut, Other Aid

WASHINGTON -- President Trump said his administration will discuss with Congress several measures to ease the economic pain inflicted by the coronavirus, including a possible payroll tax cut and help for hourly wage earners.

Administration officials were planning to meet with congressional Republicans about the proposals on Tuesday. Mr. Trump said he would hold a news conference on Tuesday afternoon to lay out the proposals in more detail. "They will be major," he said.

"We're also going to be talking about hourly wage earners getting help so they can be in a position where they're not ever going to miss a paycheck," the president told reporters in the White House briefing room on Monday evening, adding that the administration was considering "creating loans for small businesses."

White House officials were split, however, over whether the president should embrace a payroll tax cut now, and if so, how big it should be, according to two people familiar with the discussion, who said there were strong views from both sides and a spirited debate at a closed-door meeting the president held with senior officials.

Trade adviser Peter Navarro -- backed by Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, and legislative affairs director Eric Ueland -- argued in favor of a payroll tax cut, the people said.

On the other side, National Economic Council Director Lawrence Kudlow and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called instead for narrowly targeted measures aimed at helping workers without sick leave and businesses facing virus-related disruptions, the people said. They questioned how expensive and how effective a payroll tax cut would be.

Mr. Navarro attended Monday's press conference, but was one of the only officials to depart with Mr. Trump, while the others stayed and took questions.

A White House spokesman declined to comment.

Earlier Monday, top Republican senators signaled they were hesitant to move forward quickly with either a broad-based stimulus package or narrower measures, cautioning that it was too early to assess the economic damage from the outbreak.

"Let's see where we are in a month from now or three weeks from now. It's just too early, I think people need to stay calm as much as they can," said Sen. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.), chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said.

The White House and Congress are under pressure to shore up the economy as markets reel on fears of a global recession.

Messrs. Kudlow and Mnuchin are scheduled to meet with Senate Republicans at their weekly policy lunch on Tuesday.

The most significant proposals mentioned at Monday's briefing, including a payroll tax cut, would require congressional approval. But Mr. Mnuchin, speaking at Monday's briefing, said "there are certain authorities that the president has that we can do on our own."

A payroll tax cut met with skepticism from House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D., N.Y.), who said it wouldn't help people who lose their jobs. Democrats are focused on helping "the average working people around this country who are worried about how they're going to feed their families, because their businesses close," she said before a meeting with senior Democratic Party leadership.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) over the weekend outlined a series of measures including paid sick leave and expanded nutrition assistance, especially if school-lunch programs need to close. They didn't call for broader fiscal stimulus.

Senior administration officials met privately Monday afternoon to discuss coronavirus measures. In addition to the payroll tax cut, they discussed paying hourly employees who miss work because of the virus and deferring taxes for industries hardest hit by the outbreak, including the airline and cruise industries, administration officials said.

Business & Technology: Led Zeppelin Wins Copyright Appeal

Led Zeppelin didn't steal the opening bars of "Stairway to Heaven," a federal appeals court ruled, in a decision that music executives hope will slow claims that some of the most popular songs are rip-offs.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Monday put to rest a closely watched case that began in 2016 when a Los Angeles federal jury decided the British rock group didn't steal parts of the 1971 hit from an obscure single, "Taurus," by the band Spirit. The Ninth Circuit overturned that ruling in 2018, saying the judge made errors in the original case.

The case was reheard en banc -- meaning 11 appellate judges heard the case versus the typical panel of three -- in September, with music lawyers anticipating the decision would set a precedent in an area of copyright law that has become increasingly contentious since a trial over the song "Blurred Lines" in 2015.

In that case, the scope of copyright infringement was extended beyond melody and lyrics to include elements contributing to the sound and feel of the music. In 2016, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's finding, and singer-songwriters Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were ordered to pay $5.3 million for copying the 1977 Marvin Gaye hit "Got to Give It Up."

Music lawyers point to that decision as the impetus for many recent copyright cases, including one last year in which Katy Perry and collaborators of her 2013 hit "Dark Horse" were ordered to pay $2.8 million in damages for infringing on an 11-year-old Christian rap song.

"Plaintiffs' lawyers have started to say, 'Let's roll the dice' if there's a song that makes a ton of money, and juries have been siding with the plaintiffs," said music-trial litigator Ed McPherson, who filed an amicus brief in support of Led Zeppelin. "I think it will put a pin in the floodgates that really started opening with 'Blurred Lines.'"

On Monday, Mr. McPherson and others applauded the Ninth Circuit's overturning of the "inverse-ratio rule."

In copyright cases, juries must determine whether the defendant could have accessed the alleged infringed song and whether the songs are substantially similar. The inverse-ratio rule held that the more access a plaintiff could show, the less similarity was required to establish infringement. With the rise of music streaming on services like YouTube and Spotify, the concept of access is "increasingly diluted in our digitally interconnected world," the court said in overturning the rule.

Additionally, the court said copyright protection is limited to the deposit copy, or what is registered with the U.S. Copyright Office. That means if only sheet music is contained in the deposit copy -- as is the case with most older songs, including "Stairway to Heaven" -- the jury cannot hear a sound recording to consider how the song was performed.

"The value of a copyright case if a song is from the '60s or '70s probably just went down," said Christopher Buccafusco, a professor at Cardozo Law School in New York who also filed an amicus brief.

World News: Ethiopia Faults Design, Training in Crash

Faulty aircraft design and inadequate pilot-training recommendations from the manufacturer ledto the fatal crash of a Boeing Co. 737 MAX jet after takeoff from Addis Ababa in Ethiopia a year ago, according to an accident report issued by Ethiopian investigators.

The interim report released Monday about the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 provides some new technical analyses along with details about the cockpit drama before the plunge -- with pilots pulling back on the controls with more than 180 pounds of force to no avail. But the document indicates that neither pilot error nor potential airline slip-ups contributed significantly to the tragedy that killed all 157 on board.

The findings contrast with other government and industry reports that highlighted the interplay of causal factors, ranging from Boeing's misguided engineering assumptions to lax regulatory oversight to at least one significant incorrect pilot command.

Monday's report gives short shrift to such contributing causes and focuses largely on Boeing's failings in devising a powerful new automated flight-control feature, called MCAS. That feature, which ended up aggressively and repeatedly pushing down the nose of the Ethiopian airliner, is being fixed before the global MAX fleet returns to service.

The global MAX fleet has been grounded since the March crash, touching off the biggest corporate crisis in Boeing's history and sending ripple effects throughout the aviation industry.

The report mentions but doesn't elaborate on a central question of why Ethiopian pilots, after turning off MCAS as required by an emergency checklist, ultimately flipped a switch that reactivated the feature that overpowered their efforts to pull out of the plane's dive. Within seconds, the plane became uncontrollable and ended up with its nose pointing down 40 degrees from level flight.

The interim report, among other things, concludes that the heart of the pilot training "provided by the manufacturer was found to be inadequate." It also indicates that certain cockpit alerts, designed to help pilots diagnose sensor malfunctions that could trigger a hazardous MCAS misfire, didn't work as intended or as they were described in the flight-crew operation manual. The final conclusions are expected later this year.

A spokesman for Boeing said the company continues to provide technical assistance in support of the Ethiopian-led investigation and looks forward to "reviewing the full details and formal recommendations that will be included in the final report."

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which has been criticized by congressional investigators and others for delegating too much authority to Boeing in initially vetting safety of the 737 MAX, said it is reviewing the interim findings. An email from a spokesman added: "We believe it's important to have the full final report to evaluate it against other independent reports, so that we might fully understand all of the factors -- both mechanical and human -- that played a role in thistragic loss of life."

The report also reveals, for the first time publicly, some other fundamental MAX design shortcomings. Investigators laid out the results of ground-simulator tests they conducted that pinpointed the difficulty of pilots cranking a control wheel in an emergency to counteract automated MCAS commands.

The Coronavirus Epidemic: China Woes Pressure Companies' Profits

BEIJING -- Before the coronavirus epidemic, U.S. companies were heading for record-low profitability in China as business conditions deteriorated and China's economy slowed to its lowest rate in decades, according to a survey of U.S. companies with operations in China.

That position will be further challenged as these companies seek to absorb what could be a historic hit in China, the world's second-largest economy and the epicenter of the novel coronavirus now ravaging the global economy.

The annual snapshot of business conditions, captured by the Beijing-based American Chamber of Commerce in China in a survey conducted in October and November, underscores how fragile conditions were for American companies before the Covid-19 epidemic began to come into public view in mid-January.

It calls into question whether U.S. companies in China are prepared to weather a prolonged economic rout that has ravaged the Chinese economy, a critical overseas market for many U.S. companies, for a month and a half -- and looks set to continue well into the spring.

"Large corporations are in fact a linchpin for small- and medium-sized enterprises. If large corporates are struggling with revenue and cash flow, there's a trickle-down effect," the American Chamber in China's chairman, Greg Gilligan, said in an interview. "They'll all feel the crunch."

Fears about the virus's impact on global growth have shaved trillions of dollars off the value of global stocks, as the virus's quick spread outside China stokes fears that it could hurt consumption, hold up investment and snarl supply chains.

Before the outbreak, U.S. companies in China were already concerned about their business prospects in the country, largely because of U.S.-imposed tariffs that had weighed on demand and increased manufacturing costs.

The rising cost of labor in China also led some firms to move their supply chains out of China, while others said the softening economy in China had made it difficult to grow.

American companies surveyed by AmCham reported their lowest levels of profitability since the chamber first began asking the question 18 years ago: 61% of members described their 2019 financial performance as profitable or very profitable, an 8-percentage point drop from the year before.

Those problems are only set to worsen.

With tens of millions of Chinese still quarantined, many companies are responsible for their employees' salaries, regardless of whether they are able to work, a further drag as U.S. companies warn they could lose as much as half of their annual revenue from China if the epidemic extends into the summer.

Many companies that have been able to restart some operations face increased labor costs, with workers earning triple their usual pay and requiring special protective gear.

The annual survey was sent to 771 of the chamber's member companies, of which 372 completed the majority of the questions, the chamber said.

Respondents represented large, midsize and small enterprises from a broad range of industries, including many with global operations.

Before the outbreak, more than 40% of American companies in resources and industrials -- including agribusiness, automotive, equipment makers and oil and gas companies, among others -- said they didn't expect their markets to grow in 2020.

U.S. News --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: Crisis Jolts Views on National Security

As the severity of the coronavirus outbreak was becoming clear, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri sent a letter to the Food and Drug Administration arguing that the crisis was revealing a dangerous dependence on China in one key area.

"The novel coronavirus in China highlights severe, longstanding, and unresolved vulnerabilities in our capacity to produce lifesaving pharmaceutical drugs and medical devices for our own citizens," Mr. Hawley wrote. "This is unacceptable."

As that alarm suggests, the coronavirus is becoming far more than a public-health problem. Eventually the crisis will pass, but a shock as big as this one will change political and economic assumptions in some fundamental ways.

It is altering the very definition of a national security threat, increasing the incentive for American companies to diversify supply chains away from China, illustrating the limits of central-bank powers and increasing respect for much-maligned government professionals.

In an immediate political sense, the coronavirus outbreak likely is helping the Democratic primary campaign of former Vice President Joe Biden, whose executive-branch experience and more mainstream approach make him appear to be a safer choice than Sen. Bernie Sanders in a time of turmoil.

But that may be the least of the coronavirus effects. For years, national security professionals have been telling one another that, in a post-Cold War world, with a globally connected economy, nontraditional threats such as cyberattacks, biological warfare and global pandemics should be getting more attention.

Indeed, the national security strategy President Trump's White House issued at the end of 2017 noted this changed threat matrix: "Naturally emerging outbreaks of viruses such as Ebola and SARS, as well as the deliberate 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States, demonstrated the impact of biological threats on national security by taking lives, generating economic losses, and contributing to a loss of confidence in government institutions."

Well, here we are. Unfortunately for the president, his administration followed those words of warning by downgrading the attention paid to pandemic threats on the National Security Council staff and proposing funding reductions for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those steps aren't likely to be repeated in the future.

"This should make U.S. leaders do what they should have done long ago, and do more to address national security threats of a nonmilitary nature," says Frederick Kempe, president of the Atlantic Council.

Certainly the crisis will make American firms think harder about a question they already had been pondering amid trade fights between the U.S. and China: Is it smart to be so dependent on a single source for either parts or finished products when so many external factors -- political currents in the U.S., heavy-handed tactics in China, now a global epidemic -- could undermine the reliability of that source?

There is an even broader implication for the financial system. The crisis will compel government leaders, in the U.S. and abroad, to re-evaluate the playbook they thought they had available to deal with an economic shock. For years, the go-to move for government officials was to rely on central bankers to cut interest rates to juice the economy in a time of fear and turmoil.

That, in fact, is what Mr. Trump pounded on the Fed to do in this crisis -- and is exactly what the Fed decided to do last week. Yet with interest rates already at historic lows, cutting another half a percentage point had virtually no impact on financial markets preoccupied with larger forces. Moreover, a rate reduction, by itself, does little to directly address this kind of crisis, in which easy money is powerless to restore broken supply chains.

"The markets were happy about that for about 15 minutes and then they gave it a Bronx cheer," says Alan Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Fed who now is a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution. "It illustrates that feeding the beast when the beast is hungry is almost impossible." Policy makers will have to rethink their playbook -- and think about fiscal rather than monetary stimulus.

The coronavirus also is revealing how a fundamentally altered oil market affects the U.S. Oil prices are collapsing as China's need for fuel wanes. For decades, lower oil prices translated automatically into good news for the American economy. No longer. The fracking boom has made America a net energy exporter, and collapsing oil prices hurt upstart American energy companies.

One final effect of note: Government professionals have been taking a drubbing in the past few years, widely accused of being part of a "deep state" interested in undermining elected officials. Suddenly the expertise of government pros is newly appreciated. There is no more reassuring figure in the public eye at the moment than Anthony Fauci -- who has been director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for 35 years.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Cleaning Up the FISA Mess

Inspector General Michael Horowitz in December exposed gross FBI abuse of a secret surveillance court in obtaining warrants to spy on former Trump aide Carter Page. House leaders late Tuesday struck a bipartisan deal to impose greater accountability, though in at least one respect it may make things worse.

Congress is facing a March 15 deadline to reauthorize three critical surveillance tools, all of which are overseen by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. That's the court the FBI duped in 2016-17 by supplying false information provided by the Hillary Clinton campaign and omitting exculpatory facts about Mr. Page.

Despite these revelations, House Democrats initially planned a reauthorization that contained negligible reform. But a revolt by progressives against nearly any surveillance forced Democratic leaders to seek GOP votes. Thus the chance for some modest reform.

Congress created FISA in the late 1970s to guard against wiretap abuse. The best reform would be to abolish the court. As legal sages Laurence Silberman and Robert Bork pointed out in 1978, Presidents are responsible to voters if they abuse spying powers. FISA inserts unelected Article III judges into the process, diluting accountability. The FBI insisted its Page applications were valid since the court approved them, while the court blames a dishonest FBI. The abuses are always someone else's fault.

Alas, abolishing FISA now would require a rewrite of most intelligence laws -- which isn't feasible before this reauthorization. The fallback is to change the FISA process to impose more accountability on the FBI and Justice Department, and the GOP seems to have achieved some important victories.

The most significant reform writes into law Attorney General Bill Barr's recent administrative requirement that politically sensitive investigations be approved by the AG. One scandal of the Page investigation is that the FBI had no obligation to consult or even notify its Justice bosses. As a cabinet official, the AG is accountable to the President and thus to voters.

Another improvement requires a system of checks to ensure that information submitted to the court is accurate. The Horowitz report highlighted the ease with which individual agents could drop false details into the Page file, while leaving out exculpatory facts.

Republicans also won criminal penalties for officials who make false representations to the court. The risk here is that a criminal standard could end up punishing intelligence officials who make good-faith errors. Our sources say the bill's language is narrow enough that it won't trap honest mistakes but will punish FBI agents who try to pass off on the court disinformation of the kind peddled by partisan spy Christopher Steele.

The House version also includes greater access by the House and Senate intelligence committees to the documents used to justify FISA applications. Recall how the Justice Department initially refused to let then House Intelligence Chair Devin Nunes review the Page warrant files. Only thanks to Mr. Nunes's doggedness did we learn about the FBI's FISA abuse. The risk here is that some Members might abuse the privilege to leak.

The bill's worst reform would let a FISA judge choose an outsider advocate for the target of a FISA application. In theory, advocates would find and critique the abuses found in the Page application. In practice, they could dilute accountability further. There's no guarantee advocates would stop political shenanigans, though they may impede legitimate FISA warrants.

Consider the FISA court's recent appointment of David Kris as its point man for internal reform. Mr. Kris criticized the Bush Administration's wiretaps of suspected terrorists in 2006 but defended the FBI's abuse of Mr. Page. An advocate system would create another unaccountable bureaucratic layer to engage in finger pointing when things go wrong.

FISA was created as a check on wiretap abuses, but it failed as do most attempts to mess with the Constitution's separation of powers. We'd prefer to remove Article III judges from the executive branch where they don't belong, but this reform will at least make it harder to repeat the FBI's Page disgrace.

Many Ransomware Hackers Can't Undo Their Deeds

CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Paying hackers to recover data doesn't guarantee they will actually do so, and sometimes it's because they don't know how, experts say.

The availability of ransomware on dark-web forums means that anyone with the inclination and a relatively low level of technical ability can aim an attack at a company or a city, said Roy Hadley, special counsel at law firm Adams & Reese LLP who focuses on data security and privacy.

"Previously you had a few bad actors, but they knew what they were doing. Now you have kids who are infecting networks with ransomware who really don't know how to do it right in the infection stage, and they definitely don't know how to do it on the decryption stage," he said, speaking at the WSJ Pro Cybersecurity Symposium on Monday.

Even the professionals sometimes hand over bad decryption tools once they are paid, said Jeff Stutzman, chief information security officer at security company Global Guardian LLC, on the sidelines of the conference.

"Two years ago, I paid the third-largest ransom in U.S. history. The company was losing $25 million a day, they'd shut down trading on Nasdaq, and were facing extinction. When the first encryption key came, three hours after I paid a very high, six-figure sum, it didn't work," he said.

After communications with the attackers, a second key did work, Mr. Stutzman said, but that's often not the end of the story for companies hit by a ransomware attack.

"Within 30 days, you'll start to see new activity. We fought them back for months and months," he said. The attacks stopped only after Mr. Stutzman's team was able to identify the ransomware, a variant that changed its parameters on the fly to avoid detection software.

Authorities such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation advise companies not to pay ransoms, saying it encourages further attacks. Senior officials from the Department of Homeland Security have repeated that warning in recent weeks.

"It just feeds the beast," said Maria Thompson, state chief risk and security officer for North Carolina, referring to paying ransoms.

In any case, Mr. Hadley said, paying ransoms only fixes the immediate problem, if it solves it at all. It does nothing to fix the underlying vulnerabilities that let attackers penetrate the network in the first place, he said, and those who neglect closing security holes could find themselves being extorted again.

U.S. News: U.S. Cyber Defenses Fall Short, Commission Says

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. government needs to adopt structural changes not seen since the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks to confront proliferating cyber threats that increasingly endanger national and economic security, a government commission has concluded.

The Cyberspace Solarium Commission is releasing a report Wednesday detailing the results of a study, calling for changes ranging from modifications of existing functions to the substantial overhaul of the federal government.

One recommendation, for example, urges the creation of new committees in Congress dedicated solely to cybersecurity. Another calls for creation of a Senate-confirmed post of National Cyber Director in the White House.

In sometimes stark language, the commission assesses bluntly that the U.S.'s current approach to preventing or mitigating damage from cyberattacks is fundamentally flawed and in need of immediate change.

"The U.S. is currently not designed to act with the speed and agility necessary to defend the country in cyberspace," the report said. "Our country has lost hundreds of billions of dollars to nation-state-sponsored intellectual property theft using cyber espionage."

The report says the U.S. must better prepare for a major cyberattack that could, for example, "create chaos and lasting damage exceeding that wreaked by fires in California, floods in the Midwest, and hurricanes in the Southeast."

The commission is a congressionally mandated body formed last year and led by bipartisan members of Congress and current and former officials from various federal agencies.

Authors of the report acknowledged in interviews that several recommendations may be difficult to achieve, even in the long term, given political hurdles and Washington's tendency to stick to the status quo in the absence of crisis.

"This is the 9/11 Commission report without 9/11," said Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats and co-chaired the commission. "We understand that this is a tall order."

A core theme of the 182-page report is that successive presidential administrations largely have failed to deter Russia, China and other adversaries, including criminal groups, from carrying out increasingly debilitating cyberattacks.

Cyber-policy experts have discussed deterrence for years but have found that traditional tools -- such as sanctions or indictments -- yield little to no change in behavior.

The report outlined a three-tiered strategy of "layered cyber deterrence" to reduce the consequences of cyberattacks. Those layers include shaping acceptable international norms in cyberspace, denying benefits to adversaries seeking gain through cyber capabilities, and imposing greater costs -- including direct retaliation when necessary -- on those who do.

"The three layers of cyber deterrence rest on a common foundation: the need to reform how the U.S. government is organized to secure cyberspace and respond to attacks," the report said.

Several other commissions previously studied cybersecurity and recommended dramatic new approaches by the federal government. But those typically haven't involved current members of Congress or senior leadership from federal agencies.

Four U.S. lawmakers are serving on the 14-member Cyberspace Solarium Commission, as did senior national security officials, including FBI Director Chris Wray and Chris Inglis, the former deputy director of the National Security Agency.

Riskier Muni Bonds Miss Rally

Municipal-bond prices have surged as the potential impact of the novel coronavirus has driven investors into safer assets. But not all bonds have enjoyed the rally, with investors shying away from riskier debt and from securities likely to be affected by the virus, namely travel and hospitality bonds.

Investors are paying less for debt from convention-center hotels and airports as the potential economic reach of the novel coronavirus becomes clearer. Overall prices on riskier bonds fell last week as well, as investors pulled money from high-yield funds and the S&P Municipal Bond High Yield Index dropped five days in a row.

Some investors have become increasingly concerned that amid signs of a global slowdown, these less creditworthy bonds carry more risk than they are worth, analysts said.

"A whole bunch of municipal-bond credits are reliant on a well-functioning economy, are reliant on a well-functioning transportation industry," said Nicholos Venditti, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management. "That's a little scary."

Overall, municipal-bond prices have continued to climb in the roughly $4 trillion muni market as investors seek out safe-haven investments, driving yields to a nearly 40-year low Friday, according to Refinitiv.

Muni bonds have been a sought-after investment over the past several years as falling supply and the increasing value of the tax exemption on municipal-bond interest have stoked demand. That leaves plenty of room for prices to fall as the market reacts to risks associated with the virus.

Yields rose between 12% and 35% from Feb. 28 to March 5 on a sampling of a dozen bonds backed by airports, airlines, a convention-center hotel and an amusement park, according to an analysis by Jon Barasch, director of municipal evaluations at financial analytics company ICE Data Services. The comparison is based on trade data and the firm's valuations of those bonds.

That contrasts with the broader municipal market, where yields fell 10% for five-year bonds over the same period and rose by a maximum of 3% for longer-maturity debt, according to ICE Data Services' Muni Yield Curve.

Beginning March 2, "the weakness became more prevalent," Mr. Barasch said.Yields rise as prices fall.

While municipal bonds are most often the liabilities of state and local governments with the power to collect taxes and fees, about $784.5 billion is issued on behalf of nonprofit or for-profit businesses, according to Federal Reserve data, typically for projects thought to have some public benefit, such as economic development.

Prices dropped on some bonds backed by airline payments last week, Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board data show. Bonds issued in October to build an aircraft-maintenance facility at Los Angeles International Airport traded at 115 cents on the dollar Thursday, down from nearly 119 cents on the dollar in mid-February. Bonds that financed a passenger terminal construction project at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport, which last traded around 107 cents on the dollar in late 2018 and which analysts had valued at about 106, sold for 103 cents on the dollar on Friday.

Meanwhile, the S&P Municipal Bond High Yield Index experienced its biggest one-day drop in more than a year Friday. It dropped every trading day last week. The VanEck Vectors High-Yield Municipal Index ETF has its biggest price drop in at least five years Monday, a decline of more than 5%, as investors continued to pull money from high-yield munis.

Mr. Venditti said that the municipal market tends to react more slowly than the corporate-bond market, where bond prices have already fallen for many companies whose fates are linked to travel or economic growth. "Ultimately that lag may cost investors," he said.

For example, tax-exempt municipal bonds backed by United States Steel Corp. could fetch a yield of 2.394%, or an estimated 3.8% after taxes if sold today, according to an analysis of Bloomberg data by Mr. Venditti. That compares with an expected yield of 10.801% on the company's corporate debt.

It isn't just the infrastructure and transportation sectors that are vulnerable. High-yield muni-bond funds often contain the debt of senior-living facilities and financially distressed local governments, two borrowers looking particularly susceptible to the impact of the coronavirus. Long-term-care facilities around the country are bracing themselves after a facility in Kirkland, Wash., emerged as the site of some of the earliest U.S. cases.

Business News: PG&E, First Responders Settle --- At issue is more than $4 billion in bankruptcy claims not set aside for victims

PG&E Corp. has come to terms with federal and state first responders, who have agreed they won't take money set aside for victims of the wildfires that drove California's largest utility into bankruptcy.

Announced at a hearing Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco, the utility's agreements with the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency and state agencies clear up a major trouble spot for PG&E, which is racing to meet a June 30 deadline to emerge from bankruptcy.

PG&E filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2019 and is proposing a $59 billion bankruptcy exit plan, which earmarks $25.5 billion for insurance companies, cities and people with damages stemming from fires linked to PG&E equipment.

As Judge Dennis Montali weighed the company's bid for approval to start the voting process on the plan, lawyers announced the agreements with FEMA and California agencies.

Due to the agreements, people who lost loved ones, homes and businesses to the blazes of 2017 and 2018 will no longer have to worry that they will be forced to share with government emergency services the $13.5 billion earmarked for fire victims under PG&E's proposed chapter 11 plan.

California is dropping its claims to recoup about $300 million it spent on firefighting and emergency services, while FEMA has agreed to chop its claim from $3.9 billion to $1 billion. Additionally, FEMA has agreed it will only attempt to collect after all individual victims are paid in full from the $13.5 billion.

Justice Department lawyer Matthew Troy said the settlement still needs approval from various agencies and the Justice Department.

The pact represents a turnabout for an agency whose regional administrator, Robert Fenton, had in recent months threatened to pursue wildfire victims in court to recoup the money the federal government spent on everything from traffic control to emergency housing as the fires swept through PG&E's service territory.

FEMA said PG&E was to blame for lax safety practices that created the conditions for the catastrophic fires, and if the company didn't pay back federal emergency aid agencies, FEMA would attempt to collect from the victims.

The federal agency's stance triggered a backlash from lawyers for fire victims, who had been fighting PG&E in court for years.

The $13.5 billion payout to the victims will be in the form of cash and stock, and it will be placed in a trust, as individuals and businesses prove out their claims and collect their money, assuming the company's chapter 11 plan makes it to the finish line.

Once the votes are in, PG&E will return to court to seek approval of a chapter 11 plan that calls for the utility to issue a combination of new debt and equity. To exit bankruptcy, PG&E will need to come up with $59 billion to pay creditors, and contribute to a statewide fund designed to protect its balance sheet from future wildfire damage claims.

Cuomo Warns Revenue Will Drop

New York lawmakers, facing a $6 billion budget deficit, began the month with an optimistic projection. Stock markets were doing well, Wall Street bonuses were coming in strong, and lawmakers could plug some of the gap by assuming another $700 million in revenue was coming.

Also at the beginning of the month, the state confirmed its first case of novel coronavirus.

With U.S. markets in turmoil and the potential for an economic slowdown fueled by closures and cancellations rising, Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday asked the state comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, to reassess the revenue situation.

His determination will have a major impact on the spending plan that lawmakers are crafting before the state fiscal year ends March 31. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, proposed a $178 billion budget that didn't increase taxes. Democrats who control the state Assembly and Senate are set to unveil counterproposals.

"It's pretty obvious there are significant risks now to the economy and certainly state revenue," Mr. DiNapoli said in an interview.

Mr. DiNapoli, a Democrat, said analysts in his office will examine the most recent data regarding tax collections, tourism and the performance of Wall Street firms. Mr. DiNapoli's office publishes an annual estimate of profits and bonuses in New York's securities industry and found that it accounted for 18% of state revenue in the fiscal year that ended in 2018.

The S&P 500 is down 14% over the past month. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index is down 29% over the same period.

Mr. Cuomo said during a Tuesday radio interview that the effects of the coronavirus likely would decrease revenue. New York has 173 confirmed cases.

"Forget just the stock market and the financial bonuses," Mr. Cuomo said. "Reservations at hotels are being canceled. Businesses are canceling their meetings. Conventions are canceling, restaurants are empty, tourism is way down. You may be looking at a nine-month economic slowdown across the board."

State officials jointly estimated on March 1 that they would collect about $57 billion of personal income taxes in the coming fiscal year, the largest revenue stream in the budget.

Fiscal watchdogs said the reconsideration was a prudent step, given the spread of the virus.

U.S. News: Court Grants Congress Access to Mueller Files

WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court ruled that Congress can have access to grand-jury materials from Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in a 2-1 ruling Tuesday, sided with the Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee, which sought access to material that was redacted from the 448-page special counsel report, as well as some of the exhibits and transcripts referenced in the report.

The report was the culmination of Mr. Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether President Trump or his associates were connected with that interference.

Mr. Mueller found insufficient evidence to charge anyone associated with the Trump campaign of a crime in connection with Russian election interference, and he said he couldn't exonerate Mr. Trump of obstructing the probe. Attorney General William Barr then concluded that Mr. Trump's actions didn't amount to obstruction of justice. Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

Democrats on the Judiciary Committee previously said they needed the underlying Mueller materials to evaluate whether Mr. Trump committed an impeachable offense in the course of the investigation.

The appeals court, in an opinion by Judge Judith Rogers, said the committee had established it had a valid need for the information, especially because Mr. Mueller stopped short of making conclusions about Mr. Trump's conduct, in part to avoid pre-empting the House from doing so.

"The committee has established that it cannot fairly and diligently make a final determination about the conduct described in both volumes of the Mueller Report without the grand jury material referenced therein," wrote Judge Rogers, who was joined in the majority by Judge Thomas Griffith.

Judge Griffith wrote the appeals court's recent ruling against the Judiciary Committee that declined to enforce Democrats' subpoena for testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn. The judge on Tuesday said the fight over the grand-jury materials involved different issues that gave the House the upper hand.

In dissent, Judge Neomi Rao said it wasn't clear that the committee could still show that it needed the materials, given that the House already impeached the president and the Senate acquitted him. Judge Rao also maintained that the Judiciary Committee didn't have standing to obtain a court order requiring the Justice Department to turn over the grand-jury materials.

For Congress, the ruling is a narrow victory that affirms the legislature's ability to receive evidence collected as part of criminal investigations to use as part of potential impeachment proceedings.

It is unlikely to have a significant impact on the majority of congressional oversight disputes, which don't involve criminal information or impeachment proceedings.

"We are reviewing the decision," said a spokeswoman for the Justice Department.

On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) cheered the decision. "This ruling is an unequivocal rejection of the President's insistence that he is above the law and his blanket refusal to cooperate with congressional requests for information," she said in a statement.

Tuesday's decision echoes a precedent from 1974 when the chief judge of the Washington, D.C., federal court transmitted a report of grand-jury material to the House as part of its inquiry into whether President Nixon should be impeached.

The court fight was sparked by a dispute between the Justice Department and Congress over the evidence collected by Mr. Mueller's investigation using a grand jury, a typically secret process designed to keep investigative details from being revealed publicly.

The department said it couldn't disclose the materials to Congress under the federal rules governing the secrecy of grand-jury material, while Congress said that the law provided for exemptions for a judicial proceeding. It argued that its impeachment investigation qualified as such a proceeding, and that it needed the materials as part of the investigation.

The Justice Department earlier turned over a version of the Mueller report to Congress that revealed some of the sensitive information it had redacted from the public version of the report, but it has refused to provide any material obtained by a grand jury, citing the longstanding precedent that grand-jury investigations are by law secret.

U.S. News: Flood Prevention Drives A Wedge in Miami Beach

MIAMI BEACH, Fla. -- Tensions are coming to a head as this city prepares for new infrastructure projects designed to fortify the low-lying island against increased flooding and sea-level rise.

Climate experts praise Miami Beach -- a diverse, international city in South Florida with wealthy sections -- for devoting $1 billion to tackle the problem, and other coastal communities look to it as a model. But some residents say plans to raise roads as much as about 5 feet above sea level and add storm-water pumps with generators the size of vans are an unsightly intrusion and a potential drag on property values.

The conflict presents the mayor and city commissioners with a dilemma: How far can they go in accommodating homeowners' concerns without undercutting the city's long-term viability?

"We will have to have the political will to make unpopular decisions," said City Commissioner Ricky Arriola. "Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence and engineering solutions proposed, there is going to be a group of our citizens who want us to do nothing."

Cities around the U.S., including New York, Norfolk, Va., and Charleston, S.C., confront similar challenges. Because Miami Beach is farther along than many of them in feeling the effects of climate change and trying to respond, its experience could hold lessons.

Lying an average of about 4 feet above sea level on porous limestone, Miami Beach is especially vulnerable. Sea levels are projected to increase as much as 21 inches by 2040 and 54 inches by 2070, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., an engineering firm hired by Miami Beach to review its climate-adaptation strategy, is expected to release its final recommendations in the next few weeks after a yearlong study. When the firm offered a preview of its proposals for road-raising and other projects at a recent public meeting, homeowners balked.

"Until we've figured out how to keep private properties dry, we should not be spending a fortune on raising streets in the entire city," said resident Hal Phillips.

In 2014, the city embarked on a plan to address more frequent and intense downpours by installing bigger storm-water pipes and new pump stations to push rainwater out to sea. It also began elevating sea walls and raising roads in the lowest-lying areas to address sea-level rise. The roughly $1 billion program is funded by a combination of sources, including bonds and residential and business utility fees.

The Sunset Harbour neighborhood, which overlooks Biscayne Bay and often flooded during the highest tides, was the first commercial and condo area where these measures were implemented.

Since January 2017, after the project was completed, the area has avoided 85 flooding incidents that would have occurred without the changes, said Roy Coley, the city's public works director.

A January study commissioned by the city and led by consulting firm ICF International Inc. estimated that raising roads in the neighborhood increased condo values 11.9%.

After Mayor Dan Gelber was elected in 2017, he invited several organizations to examine the city's approach to resiliency, including the nonprofit Urban Land Institute, which largely praised it. Last year, the city hired Jacobs Engineering Group.

Not all of the firm's suggestions are controversial. Some of them involve "blue-green infrastructure," which mimics natural defenses against flooding risks. They include "bioswales," or vegetated channels along streets, and a new park with ponds -- proposals aimed at collecting and cleaning storm water.

The recommendations that have proved most divisive are those involving elevated roads in single-family neighborhoods.

Some residents argue that by raising the street above the level where houses sit, storm water will flow down and inundate properties -- a claim the city disputes. That, in turn, will depress real-estate values, they say.

"We're under siege," said Bob Kunst, who lives in the affluent Lakeview area in the middle of Miami Beach. "The city's approach to this has jeopardized everybody."

Nearly two years ago, when the city first proposed elevating streets in the Lakeview area, Mr. Kunst and other residents formed an organization to fight the effort. They battled a rival neighborhood group that supported the road-raising plan. The city ended up postponing the project.

President Expected To Extend Tax Date

WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is likely to extend the April 15 tax deadline as part of an effort to mitigate the effects of the novel coronavirus on U.S. households and businesses, according to an administration official and another person familiar with the matter.

Neither the decision to extend the deadline nor the mechanics of how such an extension might work are yet final.

Normally, individuals must pay their prior year's taxes by April 15 or face penalties and interest charges. People can already get extensions through mid-October to file their returns as long as they have paid on time by mid-April. This decision would go further than that.

Extending the tax filing deadline would effectively act as a bridge loan for individuals and businesses facing disruptions from the virus. Treasury officials are still considering how far the filing deadline may be pushed back and who would be eligible for the extension, according to the person familiar with the discussions.

Officials believe they have the legal authority to waive penalties on late tax payments if they move back the filing date and are exploring whether they have the ability to waive the interest under an emergency disaster declaration.

Extending the deadline would also have temporary implications for the federal budget and borrowing. The Treasury depends on estimates of federal revenues to ensure it has enough cash to keep paying the government's bills on time.

Delaying tax payments could force the Treasury to borrow more in the near term. April is the largest month for federal tax payments. Last year, the Treasury collected $333 billion in individual income taxes that month.

Earlier Tuesday, House Democrats asked the Internal Revenue Service whether the government should consider pushing back the April 15 deadline, mentioning the government's existing authority to extend deadlines and waive penalties. The IRS often extends filing deadlines in affected areas after natural disasters, and the tax code specifically authorizes the Treasury to grant delays following presidentially declared disasters.

Besides the main April 15 deadline for individuals, there are also other tax deadlines for estimated payments and other types of taxpayers.

The IRS and White House didn't respond to requests for comment.

New York City correctional officials said Tuesday they were preparing measures to stop the coronavirus from infecting staff and prisoners at jails that experts said could become incubators for the rapidly-spreading disease.

The Department of Correction is focused on keeping its jail cells and shared space clean, screening visitors for symptoms, raising awareness with posters about avoiding the disease and encouraging inmates to keep a physical distance from each other, officials said.

There haven't been any confirmed cases in the city's jails, said Jacqueline Sherman, interim chairwoman of the Board of Correction at a meeting on virus preparedness Tuesday with jail and health officials. But that could change quickly, she said. "If [the virus] further reaches into New York City, the city can expect to see it reach the jails," she said.

Lawyers and prisoner advocates voiced concerns about the impact of an outbreak reaching the city's jail facilities. More than 5,000 inmates are housed daily in New York City jails, including the main facility on Rikers Island. The jail population is constantly coming and going, with employees commuting to work there, attorneys visiting their clients and inmates being transported for court appearances.

City officials said an outbreak may lead to a staffing-resource problem and an increase in employees calling out sick. Another concern: Many people who are infected aren't symptomatic and could spread the disease before they realize they have it.

Patricia Feeney, deputy commissioner of quality assurance and integrity at the Department of Correction, and other officials said the city had instituted screening throughout the court system. There is now regular monitoring for inmates and staff for fevers and flulike symptoms. If a prisoner exhibits any, he or she will be given a mask and isolated, then flagged for immediate medical treatment.

Advocates said prisoners would have trouble following government CDC guidelines for avoiding getting or spreading coronavirus. Prisoner advocates said basic behavior like hand-washing or self-quarantining can be difficult in jail. Items like hand sanitizer are deemed contraband due to its high alcohol content.

In all scenarios, inmates are held in small, confined spaces, making jails conducive for the spread of diseases, said Homer Venters, former chief medical officer at New York City's Rikers Island jail complex.

"It's virtually impossible to clean or wipe down all the parts of the jail on a routine basis," he said. The most important measure would be limiting the number of people entering correctional facilities.

Half the U.S. prison population has an underlying illness, and have health-care needs that make them especially susceptible to the virus, said Josiah D. Rich, professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University. "It's just a matter of time," he said of the virus reaching correctional facilities.

WASHINGTON -- President Trump's push to suspend the payroll tax to boost the economy during the coronavirus outbreak fell flat on Capitol Hill, as lawmakers of both parties said they preferred targeted measures to assist hourly workers and the battered travel industry.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is leading the administration's economic response to the outbreak, met Tuesday with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) to try to start negotiations on a package. Both chambers of Congress are set to leave Washington soon for a scheduled weeklong break, giving lawmakers little time to quickly pass stimulus legislation.

"I wouldn't say it's a negotiation. We're having discussions about various different policies," Mr. Mnuchin said after meeting with Mrs. Pelosi for about 30 minutes. "There's a lot of interest on a bipartisan basis to get something done quickly."

Mrs. Pelosi said she and Mr. Mnuchin sought to find "where our common ground was, as to how we go forward."

She declined to say whether the two had made any progress on a deal.

The House is aiming to vote on something before it leaves Washington on Thursday, likely a measure aimed at helping workers, a congressional aide said.

Monday's steepest one-day decline in the stock market since the financial crisis and a sharp slowdown in the travel industry have spurred efforts in Washington to put together an economic response. Congress passed and Mr. Trump signed an $8.3 billion spending bill last week funding efforts to develop a vaccine for the disease and assist response efforts across the country.

President Trump, Mr. Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow, the director of the White House National Economic Council, joined Senate Republicans for their weekly policy lunch Tuesday afternoon to gauge whether there is enough support for a payroll-tax cut and other proposals put forward by the president to shore up the economy.

Following the meeting, Mr. Trump told reporters he had discussed stimulus measures with Republicans, but offered few details.

U.S. News: Weinstein to Be Sentenced Today

When Harvey Weinstein is sentenced Wednesday in a Manhattan courtroom, some of his accusers plan to be there. They hope to watch him escorted in shackles to the defense table to learn that he will spend years in prison.

"People talk about closure -- and I'm ready to see that," said Tarale Wulff, a model who testified at trial that the Hollywood producer raped her.

Mr. Weinstein, 67 years old, faces between five and 29 years in prison after a jury found him guilty Feb. 24 of a first-degree criminal sexual act against Miriam Haley, a former production assistant, and the third-degree rape of onetime aspiring actress Jessica Mann. He was acquitted of the charges carrying the most severe penalty of life in prison -- two counts of predatory sexual assault -- but that the once-powerful Mr. Weinstein even stood trial marked a departure from cultural norms.

Mr. Weinstein says he has never had a nonconsensual sexual encounter.

During the seven-week trial, his attorneys tried to cast doubt on the multiple accusers' motivations for coming forward, describing the women as young actresses seeking the fame and fortune that Mr. Weinstein could easily facilitate.

For the dozens of women who leveled sexual-misconduct allegations against Mr. Weinstein, his sentencing represents validation after two years of uncertainty. Mr. Weinstein's case ignited the GBP MeToo movement in 2017, and Wednesday's court proceeding underscores that "we made a loud noise," said Ms. Wulff.

"Just seeing someone like Harvey Weinstein, who was so powerful, spending a year, even a day in prison, is still shocking," said Dawn Dunning, a creative director and designer who testified that Mr. Weinstein put his hand up her skirt and tried to trade film roles for a threesome with his female assistant.

Ms. Dunning said she wants to see Mr. Weinstein get the maximum sentence allowed, 29 years. Ms. Wulff said she would like to see a sentence on the higher end of the range.

Ms. Dunning and Ms. Wulff were among six women who testified at Mr. Weinstein's trial, accusing him of sexual assault. Ms. Dunning and Ms. Wulff won't be a formal part of Mr. Weinstein's sentencing because prosecutors didn't charge him with wrongdoing in either accuser's case. Their testimony was intended to show a pattern of behavior by Mr. Weinstein.

In sentencing him, New York Supreme Court Justice James Burke will consider the evidence from trial as well as letters and sentencing recommendations submitted by the prosecution and defense teams, and a report on Mr. Weinstein's life compiled by the state's probation department. Two accusers -- Ms. Haley and Ms. Mann -- whose allegations led to criminal charges are allowed to give statements about the impact of the crimes.

In their letter to the court, prosecutors recommended the judge impose an onerous prison term but have yet to ask for a specific number. They called him a man who "consistently advanced his own sordid desires" and "displayed a staggering lack of empathy" for his entire adult, professional life.

Mr. Weinstein's defense team -- citing his years of charitable endeavors, unmatched fall from grace, acquittal on the most serious counts, and his age and health -- asked for the minimum: five years.

Even a relatively brief prison term may serve as a functional life sentence for Mr. Weinstein, whose health has visibly deteriorated since the allegations emerged. The producer was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center after the verdict, where he underwent heart surgery. He remained there for 10 days before his transfer to the city's Rikers Island jail facility last week.

For Ms. Dunning, Mr. Weinstein's conviction and impending prison term offset the harrowing experience of testifying in court and enduring an aggressive cross examination.

Donna Rotunno, the producer's lead lawyer, confronted Ms. Wulff with substantive gaps in her memory, which she recovered after more than 50 sessions with a sexual-trauma clinician.Defense attorney Arthur Aidala quizzed Ms. Dunning about why she didn't tell prosecutors that Mr. Weinstein assaulted her until weeks before the trial.

"Nobody wants to be the poster person for sexual assault," Ms. Dunning said.

Those who came forward feared Mr. Weinstein, who hired private investigators and lawyers to deter women from telling their stories. Many of the women said that after Mr. Weinstein was convicted and ordered into jail, they finally didn't have to fear him anymore.

The Coronavirus Epidemic: Double Whammy Hits Businesses

Businesses are bracing for a longer and steeper coronavirus-triggered downturn than the single-quarter event initially anticipated.

The regions hit by the coronavirus are experiencing a double whammy. Business operations across Asia, Europe and the U.S. are being disrupted by factory closures, quarantined workers and shortages of components, crimping the availability of goods and services -- a so-called supply shock. Meanwhile, postponed public events and mounting fear are causing consumers and businesses to hold back, avoiding travel, restaurants and lavish purchases, even where restrictions haven't been imposed -- a demand shock.

The combined effects risk pushing the global economy into a self-reinforcing, downward spiral, a possibility fueling market turmoil and prompting many executives around the world to prepare for darker scenarios than before.

Ohio-based retailer Abercrombie & Fitch Co. is preparing for the coronavirus to affect business for six months, according to its chief financial officer, Scott D. Lipesky. "We operate in 20 countries around the world, and each of them is seeing some level of impact," he recently told investors.

Likewise, Kevin M. Fogarty, president of Houston polymer maker Kraton Corp., told investors he sees growing concern from the spread of the virus, "with potential for the disruption and the duration to linger well into the second quarter or beyond."

Moody's on Monday cut its expectations of 2020 growth in the U.S. to 1.5% from 1.7%, in China to 4.8% from 5.2%, and in the Group of 20 economies to 2.1% from 2.4%. Moody's Vice President Madhavi Bokil said, "a sustained pullback in consumption, coupled with extended closures of businesses, would hurt earnings, drive layoffs and weigh on sentiment."

Economists aren't forecasting a drawn-out global recession. They expect growth to rebound later this year after the epidemic is brought under control, but that could change if the virus continues to spread.

The outlook hinges hugely on China, where the epidemic began. The world's second-largest economy looks likely to avoid a recession yet spread enough pain to cause widespread damage. Some business leaders are warning it could be late 2020 before operations normalize.

Many businesses and economists initially expected the epidemic would track the same temporary dip and rebound seen in 2003 during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Now -- with all of Italy under quarantine and the numbers of infection cases rising in the U.S. and other major economies -- that is looking optimistic.

Suspension of travel is hitting airlines worse than the 2001 terrorist attacks, with ripple effects not only for hotels, restaurants and theaters but also the oil sector. American Airlines Group Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc. both said Tuesday they planned to cut flights and ground planes after a drop in booking.

Europe relies heavily on exports of goods and services, which are worth almost 50% of its GDP, compared with just 12% for the U.S. A deep European recession could be triggered by prolonged weakness in its two main trading partners, China and the U.S., according to Sylvain Broyer, chief European economist at S&P Global Ratings.

Continental AG, a large German auto supplier, said Thursday it would step up cost-cutting measures because of the coronavirus, which could mean more layoffs and plant closures. The company operates around 50 factories and research facilities in China, and its supply chains have been hit hard by the disruptions.

The U.S. economy has been a bright spot in the global picture. Growth was on a solid footing, albeit slowing, before the coronavirus hit.

If the U.S. economy is thrown off course this year, "it's not necessarily because of vulnerabilities that were there and waiting to be exploited, it's an all new situation," said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities. "It's going to be consumer-driven, people staying at home, not traveling and not spending."

China's Hard Line Slows Outbreak --- Authorities ignored global norms for responding to epidemics; other countries weigh tactics

When China's Communist Party locked down an entire city to fight the outbreak of a new coronavirus there, some global public-health officials warned that the iron-fisted approach ignored world-wide norms for responding to epidemics and could make things worse.

Now, with the number of new cases across China dwindling -- and rising outside its borders -- the nation's hard-line response to the pathogen is challenging decades of conventional wisdom about how best to handle infectious diseases.

This week Italy sealed itself off from the rest of the world, placing the entire nation under quarantine. South Korea has restricted travel inside the country and increased surveillance on its citizens.

On Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Wuhan, the city at the center of the pandemic, for the first time since the outbreak began, a signal that the Communist Party sees itself as winning its battle against the pathogen.

Chinese leaders were seemingly caught off-guard when the virus began to spread widely early this year. Authorities at first muzzled frontline doctors attempting to warn their peers and the public of the deadly new virus. Officials denied it could be transmitted between humans. The delays allowed infections to multiply.

Since then, Beijing has attacked it aggressively. The campaign, described by Mr. Xi as a "people's war," melds technology with tactics from the party's Maoist past.

Authorities sealed off Wuhan, a city of 11 million, on Jan. 23. At least a dozen more lockdowns followed. The party dispatched armies of low-level enforcers to guard the gates of residential compounds and restrict the movements of people living inside.

The government tapped data from state-run mobile carriers to track down individuals who slipped lockdowns, recruited volunteers to go door-to-door in apartment buildings to record body temperatures, and enlisted the help of tech companies to develop apps to separate healthy people from those at high-risk.

China's government had, at various points in January and February, confined more than 500 million mostly healthy people -- more than the combined populations of the U.S. and Mexico -- to their homes, according to a conservative Wall Street Journal estimate based on state media reports. At its height, the quarantine encompassed at least 20 provinces and regions.

World Health Organization guidelines for epidemics recommend isolation only for individuals who show symptoms, and two-week quarantines for people exposed to a Covid-19 patient. Public-health experts in the West say that is because broad, indiscriminate quarantines are hard to enforce, encourage people to lie about their health and can disrupt access to critical supplies.

Some scientists say it is too early to know for certain whether the Communist Party's reaction to the threat is the right approach. Nevertheless, signs that the contagion is dwindling outside the epicenter have caused epidemiologists and other public-health experts to rethink their assumptions about what is possible in battling epidemics.

Arthur Reingold, an infectious-disease expert at the University of California, Berkeley's School of Public Health who was initially skeptical of China's approach, said, "China has proven that maybe if you are draconian enough, if you put enough resources into it, you can actually retard transmissions."

Other nations would likely face big obstacles employing the same tactics. Unlike in many other countries, China's government has a tolerance for economic pain and willingness to run roughshod over individual rights.

"Nothing like this has been tried before in modern history," said Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. "Most countries couldn't even logistically attempt it."

The rapid imposition of quarantines, digital surveillance of potential virus carriers and mass testing have made it possible for China's government to trap most of the outbreak in Wuhan and its surrounding province of Hubei.

On March 9, 17 new cases of Covid-19 were diagnosed in Hubei, with two new cases in the rest of the country. Hubei has accounted for 96% of the 3,136 deaths from the virus in the country so far. The fatality rate for the disease stood at between 2% and 4% in Wuhan, where medical resources were stretched, and 0.7% elsewhere in China, the WHO said in a media briefing in late February.

With Covid-19 cases multiplying in other countries, the WHO said in a report published last week that China's strategy "provides vital lessons for the global response."

Giovanni Rezza, the chief epidemiologist at Italy's National Health Institute, was doubtful at first that China's measures could be implemented in Europe. He changed his mind over the weekend as the number of Italian cases climbed.

"There's no question they were able to combat the epidemic efficiently," he said Tuesday of China. "We weren't able to contain our initial cluster. Our restrictions were softer than China's. But seeing how serious is the situation in the north, we couldn't help but be scared for the rest of Italy."

South Korea, where the virus has infected more than 7,500 residents, has canceled public activities and raised its virus alert to red, the highest of four levels, clearing the way for authorities to cancel public activities and restrict domestic travel. The government also is conducting more aggressive surveillance on potential carriers of the virus.

The experience of Vivy Shen, a 27-year-old operations assistant at a video-streaming company in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, shows how Chinese authorities moved to contain the virus.

Ms. Shen spent two weeks in Wuhan on a work trip in the early stages of the outbreak, when officials were playing down the danger. She returned to Hangzhou the same day officials in Beijing dispatched medical researchers to Wuhan.

A few days later, the team revealed that the virus was passing from person to person. Officials announced the lockdown of Wuhan on Jan. 23, a day after Ms. Shen had traveled back to her hometown, the nearby coastal city of Wenzhou, to spend the Lunar New Year holiday with her family.

For a week, Ms. Shen was inundated with phone calls from police, community officials, health workers and others asking about her recent travel history and whether she had a fever. One call came from officials in a city she had passed through on her way to Wenzhou.

"They told me I had likely passed the place and my telecom provider had given them my data," she said.

Along with state-run rail operators and airlines, China's big three telecom providers -- China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom -- were the government's first line of defense against the spread of the virus. Chinese rules requiring a government-issued ID to purchase rail and plane tickets, and to buy SIM cards for phones, made it relatively easyfor authorities to track and contact anyone who had traveled through regions hard hit by the outbreak.

The mobile carriers shared location data on users who had passed through Hubei with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which in turn passed it on to the National Health Commission and other agencies involved in the virus response.

The data enabled virus response teams to reconstruct the movements of potential virus carriers and others who may have come into contact with them, a process known as contact tracing, with unusual precision. Some cities used this information to publish messages on social media detailing the movements of likely carriers to warn populations that might have been exposed.

Soon, though, it became clear that the contagion was outpacing the data. As the number of new infections climbed, party leaders turned to older methods of control. They ordered local officials to seal off more cities and towns, and activated residential committees -- remnants of the Mao Zedong era -- to conduct human surveillance on residents of neighborhoods and apartment complexes.

Home to a large community of itinerant merchants and traders, Wenzhou was one of the worst hit in the early stages of the outbreak. Officials ordered buses to stop running and closed hotels and restaurants.

The residential committee overseeing her parents' apartment ordered Ms. Shen to self-quarantine indoors for 14 days. Her mother was allowed to leave the complex to buy groceries every other day, applying for an exit permit each time.

Authorities mandated the imposition of "closed-style management" at apartment complexes, blocking off side entrances so that residents can come and go only at a single point manned by security guards. The system mirrors those used to control Muslim minorities in the far western region of Xinjiang, where authorities have instituted a mix of digital and human surveillance to suffocate a separatist movement they say is driven by extremism.

Some local governments in Hubei, at the epicenter of the epidemic, have required residents who don't comply with health guidelines to undergo compulsory education.

In the Hubei city of Huanggang, people caught in public without a mask or wandering outside without authorization have to pay a 1,000 yuan ($140) fine, and a fee of 40 yuan a day for two weeks of "forced study" classes, which are conducted in a sports stadium with students seated far apart, Huanggang residents said in interviews.

As infections rose in Huanggang in early February, the Communist Party dispatched a team there with instructions to "round up everyone who needs rounding up," according to a state broadcaster, a phrase the party also has used to describe its campaign against Muslims in Xinjiang.

In Wuhan, some younger residents have called the police on older relatives for refusing to take proper precautions against infection, according to 26-year-old Uyen Yang, one of the volunteers helping Hubei officials collate health data.

"They didn't know what else to do and are extremely worried," Ms. Yang said of friends who reported family members. "Their parents won't listen to them."

As the number of new infections declines, Chinese leaders are relaxing some of the stricter controls in a bid to restart the country's stalled economy. To guard against a resurgence in Covid-19 cases as people return to work, they have turned again to digital surveillance.

On orders from regulators, China Mobile and other telecom giants have developed services that call up a user's travel history over the prior 14 days -- the average incubation period of the virus -- so that employers and managers of commercial properties can ascertain the exposure of returning workers.

The government also has worked with e-commerce behemoth Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and social-media giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., the country's two largest tech companies, to develop smartphone apps that assign health ratings to individuals. The system Alibaba helped develop is color coded: Symptomless users with clean travel histories are given green badges that allow them to pass through city checkpoints with the scan of a QR code, while higher risk users are assigned yellow or red badges that limit their movements. On Tuesday, Hubei announced plans to implement a similar system as it begins to lift travel restrictions.

Some of those trapped in Wuhan have gone on social media to decry dire conditions in hospitals and a climate of uncertainty. Around the country, people prevented from returning to work live in fear of losing their jobs.

Still, the Chinese people interviewed by the Journal said they accepted the controls as a necessary sacrifice at a time of crisis.

Despite feeling uncomfortable at having her data shared with officials, Ms. Shen said she couldn't complain. "Moments like this, it's not the time to be difficult about such things," she said.

Some Asian governments have expanded surveillance efforts. South Korea is using credit-card transactions to track patients' travel routes, and it started using a GPS-based app to monitor people under self-quarantine. Singapore's health authorities have tapped ride-sharing data andsurveillance cameras to do the same. In Taiwan, health inspectors track mobile-phone signals to make sure people don't ignore home-isolation orders.

Officials in China and elsewhere have promised that new surveillance measures put in place to fight Covid-19 are temporary. Academics and privacy advocates, however, warn that once mass data collection has begun, governments have few incentives to roll it back.

The Afghan government agreed to release 1,500 Taliban prisoners as a goodwill gesture before starting talks with the insurgent group, putting the commitment in the form of a decree, a spokesman said.

The U.S. signed a deal with the Taliban last month to withdraw all troops within 14 months on the condition the group commit to breaking ties with terrorists and starting talks with the Afghan government and other parties.

The deal also stipulates the Afghan government, which isn't a signatory, must release up to 5,000 prisoners as part of a swap for talks to begin. The government has balked at releasing that many prisoners as a precondition for talks.

The decree, signed by President Ashraf Ghani, allows for the release of 100 prisoners a day for 15 days. After that, any further releases will be contingent on launching intra-Afghan peace talks.

The Taliban didn't immediately comment.

Biden Was Right to Back the Iraq War

'My friends are dead because of your policies," a man shouted at Joe Biden the other day. "You are disqualified, sir." He was referring to Mr. Biden's October 2002 vote for the Iraq war. But Mr. Biden should be proud of that vote.

Recall the history. President Bush, in his January 2002 State of the Union address, stated that Saddam Hussein had "plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapons for over a decade" and had "something to hide from the civilized world." He later warned that if Iraq didn't submit to inspections, the U.S. and allies might have to have to go to war with Iraq.

In October Congress passed a joint resolution empowering Mr. Bush to deploy armed forces "as he determines to be necessary" to defend America's security "against the continuing threat posed by Iraq." Mr. Biden was one of 29 Democrats to vote in favor. In February 2003, Secretary of State Colin Powell told the United Nations Security Council that Saddam was secretly developing weapons of mass destruction. But it turned out Saddam resisted inspections because he lacked WMD, not because he had them.

Assuming that he would soon be attacked, Saddam revealed to his generals that he had no WMD. If Saddam's own generals had believed he had WMD, one can hardly fault U.S. intelligence for coming to the same conclusion. The U.S. invaded Iraq in March 2003, and before the end of the month had defeated Iraqi troops and taken control of the country. U.S. troops had to go over Iraq with a fine-toothed comb before officials could conclude with certainty that there were no WMD.

In December 2003, U.S. servicemen found Saddam in an underground hideout. Before he was executed, he told interrogators that he wanted Iran to believe he had WMD. Iran was an archenemy he had fought in a bloody stalemate from 1980 to 1988. Saddam also said he wanted to reconstitute his nuclear program to compete with Iran and Israel in nuclear weapons.

Saddam Hussein was a cruel tyrant who used chemical WMD against Iraqi Shiites and Kurds and against Iran in 1981. In 1990 he conquered Kuwait, forcing the U.S. to go to war to reverse the invasion. Saddam was a menace to the region and the world, and Mr. Biden was right to support the war that deposed him.

U.S. News: Asylum Policy Can Be Enforced

WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to continue enforcing an immigration policy requiring asylum seekers at the southern U.S. border to wait in Mexico while their cases are considered.

The court on Wednesday granted an emergency request by the administration to leave the program in place for now while legal proceedings continue. The order blocks the effect of a lower-court decision that said the administration must stop implementing the policy.

The action is the latest in a series of emergency orders in which the Supreme Court has rescued or revived Trump administration policies on immigration, allowing the White House to maintain its plans while courts sort out their legality. The high-court orders have come in response to decisions by lower courts that concluded the administration's policies are unlawful, or likely so.

As is its custom with emergency orders, the court didn't explain its reasoning. While some recent matters have revealed deep divides on the Supreme Court, only Justice Sonia Sotomayor registered a public dissent to Wednesday's order.

The case hasn't been fully briefed or argued and the court's action isn't a ruling on the merits of the Trump policy.

The Trump administration has repeatedly credited its "Remain in Mexico" policy with being perhaps the single most effective deterrent for Central American and other migrants crossing the border to ask for asylum. The government ramped up the program last May, the same month border crossings reached a 12-year high, and the number of migrants arriving each month has since fallen about 75%.

The policy, formally called the Migrant Protection Protocols, made its debut in January 2019 as the Trump administration sought alternatives to releasing families seeking asylum into the U.S., where they were permitted to live for months, and often years, as their cases made their way through backlogged immigration courts.

The administration has argued that most of these people file meritless and even fraudulent claims, and it has taken numerous policy steps to prevent or deter asylum seekers from asking for protection at all.

In the past year, the government has sent more than 61,000 migrants back across the border, where they have been required to wait in violent Mexican border cities while their claims for protection are reviewed, a process that can take months. Immigration court data show that many people placed in the program, as many as half, have since abandoned their asylum claims.

The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in San Francisco, ruled Feb. 28 that the administration must halt the policy, which the court said wasn't permitted under U.S. immigration law or international treaty obligations.

The appeals court had agreed to postpone the effect of its decision temporarily, and it eventually gave the administration a week to seek intervention from the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court is unlikely to give full consideration to the policy until its next term, which begins in October.

A spokeswoman for the Justice Department said the administration was "gratified" for the Supreme Court's action.

Dodd-Frank Worsens Covid's Risk

Coronavirus is contagious. So is financial panic.

The spread of the novel coronavirus could cause a run on the financial system leading to a deep recession. Severe stock-market drops and increased demand for liquidity are warning signals. Bank equity capital has increased by $750 billion to $2.1 trillion since 2007, but a panic could still overwhelm well-capitalized banks. We need to restore the weapons to fight contagion that Congress took away during the last financial crisis. Strong pre-emptive action would greatly diminish the risk of a panic.

The previous systemic threat to the financial system was spurred by the failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008. That threat came from within the banking system in the form of bad housing loans. This time is different. Wall Street risk-taking isn't to blame for the coronavirus.

In 2008 the Fed supplied needed liquidity to the banking and nonbanking financial sector, the latter through its authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. Meanwhile, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. expanded the limits of deposit insurance, among other things providing unlimited protection for transaction accounts. The Treasury Department offered guarantees to money-market funds.

Once the crisis abated, however, there was growing public concern about "moral hazard" -- that government backstops and guarantees created incentives for risky behavior. In response, the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 limited the Fed's lender-of-last-resort powers for nonbanks, an increasingly important part of the financial system. Fed loans to nonbanks can now be made only with the approval of the Treasury secretary. They must be done through a broad program, unlike the one-off rescue of AIG, and must meet heightened collateral requirements. Loans to nonbanks must be disclosed to congressional leaders within seven days and to the public within one year. Loans to banks must be disclosed within two years. While disclosure is usually desirable, in this situation it creates the specter of future stigma that deters financial institutions from seeking even badly needed Fed funding. Even before the current crisis, banks' use of the discount window had dropped to record lows.

Dodd-Frank also prevents the FDIC from expanding guarantees to bank depositors without congressional approval, as it did in the credit crisis. And the Treasury is now prohibited from guaranteeing money-market funds. These legislative changes make it difficult for the Fed and other regulators to deal effectively with a financial panic.

Government agencies have compounded the problem of their own weakness with regulations that make it harder for financial firms to lend to each other. The liquidity coverage ratio, the Fed liquidity stress tests, and the "living wills" process require the largest banks to meet stiff liquidity requirements that can result in liquidity hoarding.

Even before the coronavirus sent markets tumbling, the scarcity of liquidity was a big problem. The 9% spike of overnight repurchase agreement, or repo, rates last September caused the Fed to supply as much as $75 billion a day to the repo market. Although the demand for such support had fallen to about $26 billion by the end of February, it rose to $100 billion on March 4. The Fed responded Monday by raising the minimum support offered to $150 from $100 billion. While this change is welcome, it falls short.

Here's what should be done immediately: First, the Fed should reactivate all the facilities it created in the crisis and any additional ones it believes necessary, so it is ready to be the strongest possible lender of last resort -- to do whatever it takes, consistent with its present legal authority. This includes making U.S. dollars available to other major central banks through currency swaps. And the Treasury secretary should announce his approval of these efforts, consistent with the requirements of Section 13(3). Second, financial regulators should modify their rules and supervision to stimulate liquidity in the interbank and repo markets. Third, Congress should restore all the powers it took away from the Fed, FDIC and Treasury during the crisis. Fourth, international coordination through the Group of 20 must be accelerated. This is a global problem.

China, Europe and Japan already have many of these powers. Policy makers in the U.S. need them too. Bold action can prevent a panic before it starts. The public knows the situation is serious and wants the government to act.

Playground Designed for Resiliency

The conservancy that oversees the Battery in lower Manhattan will break ground on one of the largest climate-change-resilient playgrounds in New York City on Thursday.

The goal for the new $18.3 million playground, which is being called the "Battery Playscape," will be one of the most green and sustainable parks in New York City, according to Battery Conservancy officials.

The 1.5-acre playground will be built within the 25-acre Battery park, which is located in a flood zone at the southern tip of Manhattan. It will sit near the SeaGlass Carousel.

In 2012, superstorm Sandy flooded and damaged a previous playground and other parts of the Battery. After the flooding, the playground was leveled, but later restored. However, the conservancy wanted a new play space that could stand up to heavy rains and storms.

"It will be a model for waterfront parks, a way to embrace resilient design and adapt to climate change," Mitchell Silver, said New York City Parks Department Commissioner.

The Parks Department plans to use the resiliency designs for the Battery play space on playgrounds around the city, including East River Park, which soon will be renovated, Mr. Silver said.

Federal and city funds are paying for the Battery Playscape, which is expected to open in spring 2021.

The playground will be divided into five geographic zones: the bluff, marsh, dune, riverbed and meadow. Many of its features will be built above the floodplain. Underground basins will take on excess water, preventing flooding into the city's sewer system. All of the plants for the playground were chosen to resist erosion.

Battery Conservancy President Warrie Price said the best time for children to visit the play space will be after rainfall, because the playground absorbs rainwater and is designed to prevent flooding.

The playground's design team chose flood-resistant materials such as granite and stone, and most of the surface of the park is permeable.

The new playground will be able to withstand future storms, Ms. Price said. "What we've built is going to be able to recover," she said.

U.S. News: Abortion Motive Law Heard By Judges

A federal appeals-court case heard Wednesday in Ohio could help shape a contentious question in abortion law: Should a woman be allowed to terminate a pregnancy because of the fetus's disability, race or gender?

The full Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is considering the validity of an Ohio law that makes it illegal for a physician to perform an abortion on a woman whose motivation is fear that the fetus has Down syndrome. Abortion opponents say the case is winnable in one of the nation's most conservative legal venues and could send the issue to the Supreme Court.

"There's a real chance that they're going to uphold this law," said James Bopp, longtime general counsel for the antiabortion National Right to Life Committee organization.

No federal appeals court has upheld such a restraint on abortion, and several federal court rulings have blocked similar provisions enacted elsewhere. The Supreme Court has barred laws that "place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability."

Last fall, a three-judge panel from the Sixth Circuit suspended enforcement of Ohio's law because it imposed too much of a burden on women seeking an abortion in violation of Supreme Court precedent. But a majority of the Sixth Circuit's judges then took the unusual step of voting to rehear the case before their entire bench.

Abortion-rights groups argue that limiting the right to terminate a pregnancy before viability is categorically unconstitutional and that Supreme Court precedent doesn't permit such exceptions.

"This law is nothing more than part of a nationwide attempt to push abortion out of reach," Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, said Tuesday. The ACLU represents abortion clinics challenging the Ohio law.

Lawyers representing the state of Ohio have defended the 2017 measure, signed into law by then-Gov. John Kasich, as an effort to protect a vulnerable population. And antiabortion advocates of the laws say abortion rights aren't so absolute.

They say the Supreme Court has never specifically examined the constitutionality of "eugenic abortion" -- the term used by the state of Ohio -- or weighed the government's interest in preventing it.

At least nine states have active laws on the books restricting abortions based on one or more fetal characteristics: the sex or race of the fetus or because of a genetic anomaly, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that promotes abortion rights. Some of those statutes haven't faced judicial scrutiny.

Last year, Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri and Utah enacted measures restricting abortions that are solely motivated by the pregnant woman's objections to giving birth to a child with Down syndrome. Kentucky and Missouri also restricted abortions based on the sex or race of the fetus. Utah's law doesn't take effect unless the restriction survives judicial review.

Similar legislation protecting fetuses with genetic anomalies or Down syndrome is pending in at least eight other states, according to the Guttmacher Institute.

In 2018, the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago struck down a provision of a 2016 Indiana statute -- signed into law by then-Gov. Mike Pence -- that restricted abortions solely motivated by the fetus's race, sex or disability.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Britain Unveils Stimulus Measures

Britain's government and central bank announced a rare joint stimulus plan to combat the debilitating effects of the coronavirus on the economy.

The move came a day before the European Central Bank was expected to introduce its own package of measures to support swooning economies in the 19-country eurozone. Economists say, though, that central-bank intervention won't be enough, and governments need to step up more aggressively as the economic pain of the virus spreads.

"There's no doubt whatever that this is a situation that calls for Keynesian deficits and not monetary stimulus," said Charles Dumas, chief economist at TS Lombard in London.

The Bank of England and the U.K. Treasury announced a joint package of initiatives to support British businesses and households as the virus spreads through the economy.

The BOE followed the Federal Reserve in cutting its benchmark rate by half a percentage point, to 0.25%, the first reduction since summer 2016, and revived a program to support lending to small and midsize businesses. It also trimmed bank capital requirements to further boost credit. It said the measures would allow lenders to extend almost GBP 300 billion ($387 billion) in new loans to companies.

Treasury chief Rishi Sunak announced measures to help businesses, including tax holidays, government refunds for staff sick pay and a GBP 500 million hardship fund to support the neediest workers.

In total, the government has earmarked up to GBP 30 billion of extra spending to combat the coronavirus for the year through March 2021, he said.

U.S. News: Low Rates Won't Fix Housing Market's Strains

With the average rate on a 30-year mortgage falling to 3.29% last week, financing a home purchase has never been cheaper. That could give the flagging economy a much-needed boost amid coronavirus fears.

Yet housing is juicing the economy less than it used to, some economists say. Housing never fully recovered from the 2008 financial crisis, and low rates won't cure its ills. Higher land costs, restrictive zoning, scarce labor and tighter lending standards still limit construction.

In the past, lower rates have helped rev up the housing market, powering the rest of the economy in the process. More homes were built and sold. New homeowners splurged on sofas and washing machines. Existing homeowners refinanced their loans, saving them money to spend on new cars or appliances instead.

The problems began when construction cratered after the housing-market crash that triggered the 2008 financial crisis. Since 2010, only 681,000 new single-family homes were started annually, on average, compared with 1.07 million between 1960 and 2003, the last year before the housing bubble, according to data from the Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Single-family starts totaled around 888,000 houses last year.

"We haven't done nearly as much building relative to the whole economy as we have historically, let alone in expansions," said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide.

Residential investment -- which includes single and multifamily construction, remodeling and brokers' fees -- now accounts for 3.1% of gross domestic product, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. That's up from a recent low of 2.4% in 2011 but far below the 5.4% long-term average, based on BEA data.

With construction down, housing is contributing less to growth. Residential investment contributed 0.27 percentage point to the rate of quarterly growth, on average, during expansions between 1950 and 2003, according to BEA data. Since 2010, the first full year of growth after the crisis, the contribution fell to 0.13 percentage point. Last year, declining residential investment shaved 0.6 percentage point off growth.

The economic benefits of housing go beyond construction. In 2015, the buyer of a newly built home spent an average of $4,500 more on appliances, furnishings and renovations than a similar consumer who hadn't just moved, according to a National Association of Home Builders analysis. The buyers of existing houses spent slightly less.

"Whether it's a new or existing home, you're going to pay to fill it up," said Mr. Berson. "New carpeting, window treatments, furniture and furnishings -- these are an important part of the total expenditure on a house."

Another postcrisis housing trend has also held back growth: More Americans are renting homes and apartments rather than buying. "The U.S. has become more of a renter nation," said Jenny Schuetz, a housing economist at the Brookings Institution.

As buyers vanished after the housing crash, developers built more apartment buildings and fewer single-family homes. The share of new multifamily units added to the housing stock was around 34% in 2009, compared with 24% in 1990, based on data from the Census Bureau and HUD.

Multifamily construction doesn't pack the same economic punch as building single-family homes. Each new multifamily unit creates the equivalent of a single full-time job, on average -- compared with three full-time jobs for a new house, according to Robert Dietz, the NAHB's chief economist.

At the same time, strong demand is driving up rents, leaving occupants less money to spend on other goods or to set aside as a down payment on a home. Between 2000 and 2016, the drop in homeownership among younger adults due to high housing costs translated to around 700,000 fewer home purchases by those in that age group, according to an analysis by Sam Khater, chief economist at mortgage giant Freddie Mac.

Higher prices are largely a result of supply constraints. One of them is a shortage of skilled construction workers. Another is restrictive building and zoning codes in major cities such as New York and Los Angeles, which have increasingly become centers of job growth and prosperity.

"All of this has made home construction more expensive, and therefore less profitable," said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin, an online real-estate brokerage. "That's partly why it's contributing less to GDP."

To be sure, the economy still stands to benefit from ultralow rates as homeowners refinance, which reduces their monthly payments, freeing up income to spend. And online mortgage lender Better.com, which averages around $700 million in loans a month, says application volume in the first 10 days of March nearly surpassed the total for all of February. Though refinancing has spurred much of that, new applications have surged too, the company says.

U.S. News: Canadian CEO to Plead Guilty In College Admissions Scandal

A Canadian businessman is expected to plead guilty to fraud conspiracy after being accused of having someone else take the SAT on behalf of his two sons.

Prosecutors say David Sidoo, a Vancouver father who also played pro football in Canada, paid $200,000 to William "Rick" Singer, mastermind of the college admissions cheating scheme, who in turn paid a test-taking whiz to sit for the standardized exams in place of his sons.

A Wednesday court filing indicates Mr. Sidoo will appear before a federal judge in Boston to formally enter a guilty plea Friday. According to his plea agreement, prosecutors and Mr. Sidoo are jointly recommending a sentence of 90 days in prison, a $250,000 fine and one year of supervised release.

"His desire is to seek finality to this process," said Mr. Sidoo's attorney, Martin Weinberg.

Mr. Sidoo was one of 36 parents charged in connection to the case, which was unveiled by federal authorities last March.

He is the 22nd to plead guilty or agree to do so.

All but one parent sentenced in the case so far have received prison terms, ranging from two weeks to nine months.

Other parents who have pleaded not guilty are scheduled to go to trial in two groups, in October and January.

Mr. Sidoo stepped down as chief executive of East West Petroleum Corp. after charges were announced.

Prosecutors say Mark Riddell used fake IDs with his picture and Mr. Sidoo's sons' names to take the SAT in Vancouver in 2011 and in California in 2012.

Mr. Riddell has pleaded guilty to taking the exams on behalf of the teens and, later, working as a test proctor for other clients of Mr. Singer's.

Mr. Singer shifted his approach after testing agencies tightened security, having Mr. Riddell fix wrong answers after the fact or feed the answers to students instead of standing in for them.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Taxpayer Cushion Sought in a Later Deadline

WASHINGTON -- Tax professionals' frenzied period before the April 15 tax deadline will likely be stretched over a longer time frame, offering a cash cushion to some taxpayers and easing the need for face-to-face contacts that could spread the novel coronavirus.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday he is recommending that President Trump delay certain tax-payment deadlines, except for the "superrich" and large businesses. He said the move would keep money in taxpayers' hands at a time when the economy may struggle.

The administration hasn't yet announced details of how the delay would work or how long it would last. The tax code allows the Internal Revenue Service to delay some deadlines for up to six months without a disaster declaration and offers broader authority to delay payments, interest and penalties for up to one year if the president does declare a disaster.

"For small and medium-sized businesses, for hardworking individuals, we are going to recommend to the president that we allow the delay and that they don't have to pay any interest or penalty on that," Mr. Mnuchin told reporters Wednesday following a congressional hearing. "That will have the impact of putting over $200 billion back into the economy."

Generally, early returns are filed by taxpayers with lower incomes and those who count on refunds. People with more complicated returns and those who owe money tend to file closer to April 15. Some pay taxes they owe by April 15 and file a return by mid-October.

"While providing penalty relief is insufficient to address this crisis alone, it would at least lift one burden off the backs of taxpayers, who are trying to keep themselves and their loved ones safe," Democratic senators, led by Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Patty Murray of Washington, wrote in a letter to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig on Wednesday.

State tax authorities often follow federal definitions and deadlines, though in most cases they would need to act separately to change filing and payment dates, said Verenda Smith of the Federation of Tax Administrators.

The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants offered its recommendations on Wednesday. Those include letting people extend tax filing until Oct. 15 without filing a form, waiving interest through Oct. 15 and waiving some penalties for late payments and underpayments.

Any delay would disrupt the routines of tax preparers and accountants.

"It will be a total disaster," said Janet Hagy, an accountant in Austin, Texas. "So many clients procrastinate, and we're already in the funnel leading to April 15. An extension will just prolong the pain."

Andy Mattson, an accountant with Moss Adams LLP in Campbell, Calif., said an extension of the deadline would come as a relief for many firms, especially smaller ones.

"Without an extension, it will be hard for many tax firms to meet the April 15 deadline," he said. "Clients often prefer to mail confidential information to the office rather than email it."

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Coronavirus Declared to Be A Pandemic

The spread of the new coronavirus has reached a pandemic, spanning 112 countries and regions, the World Health Organization declared, as disruptions to daily life ricocheted around the world.

The WHO generally defines a pandemic as a disease that has become widespread around the world, with an impact on society. The term has been applied to only a few diseases in history -- a deadly flu in 1918, the H1N1 flu in 2009 and HIV/AIDS among them.

"We're deeply concerned, both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction," WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. "We have never before seen a pandemic sparked by a coronavirus."

President Trump on Wednesday announced a 30-day ban on travel from Europe to the U.S. in an effort to mitigate the impact of the virus.

Italy ordered all shops except for food stores and pharmacies to close, deepening its nationwide lockdown. Large gatherings were banned in many cities. Additional schools closed. The Chicago and New York City St. Patrick's Day parades have been put off. The National Basketball Association suspended its season.

By Wednesday night, global confirmed cases had grown to over 126,000, with more than 4,500 deaths, data compiled by Johns Hopkins University showed.

Still, Dr. Tedros said, the new coronavirus can be stopped if governments move swiftly and decisively.

The pandemic label doesn't require new WHO recommendations. But the move could get more resources to a rapidly worsening situation, some health experts said.

"I hope that it adds urgency to efforts to mitigate it, because those efforts need urgency," said Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics.

On a call with reporters, Dr. Lipsitch said he believes there are thousands of people in the U.S. infected with the new coronavirus who haven't been tested. There were 1,311 confirmed cases in the U.S. Wednesday night, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins. The death toll grew to at least 36.

Public-health leaders, businesses and individuals should move more aggressively to prevent further spread rather than focusing on containing known clusters, Dr. Lipsitch said. That means canceling more large gatherings, reducing travel, implementing policies that encourage people to stay home when sick, and otherwise reducing social contact such as handshaking.

On Wednesday, San Francisco Mayor London Breed said events with 1,000 or more people would be prohibited. Kentucky's governor became the first in the nation to call publicly on churches to cancel services this Sunday.

"I don't believe that whether you go to church during this time is a test of faith," Gov. Andy Beshear said.

In Washington state, the site of one of the largest outbreaks in the country, where cases grew to 366 on Wednesday, Gov. Jay Inslee moved to prohibit gatherings of 250 people or more across three counties. In King County, where at least 234 people have tested positive and 26 have died, plans were made to ban events with even fewer attendees unless they meet certain health guidelines.

Seattle Public Schools, the state's largest school district with more than 53,600 students, said it would close all schools for at least 14 days, starting Thursday. Last week, a district in the city's northern suburbs directed students to stay home -- a measure, officials said on Wednesday, that has so far proved effective.

The moves follow similar containment measures in Europe and Asia.

China, where the outbreak began in December, has all but declared victory over the disease as the number of new cases has dropped sharply after the country's hard-line response to the pathogen. China's National Health Commission reported on Wednesday 24 new infections, 10 of them imported -- highlighting how the epidemic has evolved and shifted.

Iran confirmed 63 new deaths, the highest single-day toll there since the new coronavirus appeared three weeks ago, as total infections reached 9,000. Japan reported its second-biggest one-day rise in confirmed cases thus far, taking the country's total to 568. South Korea -- trailing only China, Italy and Iran in cases -- reported 242 more on Wednesday, bringing its total to 7,755.

In Italy, where the largest outbreak outside of China pushed the country to implement an unprecedented nationwide quarantine, the number of cases climbed on Wednesday to 12,462, with 827 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins data. In Germany, cases increased to 1,908 and officials said they expected the number to rise.

"As long as there is no immunity in the population, no vaccines and no therapy, then a high percentage of the population -- experts say 60% to 70% -- will become infected," German Chancellor Angela Merkel said.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: House Democrats Lay Out Priorities On an Aid Package

WASHINGTON -- House Democrats rushed to complete an economic package responding to the spread of the new coronavirus and win support from the Trump administration before a scheduled weeklong break.

The package House Democrats prepared and released late Wednesday would provide for paid sick leave for people affected by the coronavirus and expand unemployment insurance, among other measures. The legislation reflects a series of priorities House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) laid out at the start of the week.

Democratic lawmakers plan to pass it on the floor Thursday, though it's unclear how much Republican support it will have.

Lawmakers were hoping to release the bill Wednesday and pass it on the floor Thursday. Mrs. Pelosi spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin twice on Wednesday as Democrats sought backing from the administration on the legislation. She also met with Mr. Mnuchin on Tuesday.

Republicans were also considering policy steps Wednesday evening, leaving open the possibility that Capitol Hill could cobble together a bipartisan compromise to address the economic consequences of the pandemic in just a matter of days. House Republican leadership met Wednesday to discuss possible legislation, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) was in contact with Mr. Mnuchin on Wednesday.

Prospects of a bipartisan agreement have fallen to Mr. Mnuchin and Mrs. Pelosi. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said he would defer to the Trump administration, and House Republicans indicated they would also fall in line behind the White House.

Democrats and the administration agree on the need to expand paid sick leave as lawmakers worry about hourly-wage earners who may continue to go to work even if they contract the disease. Larry Kudlow, the director of the White House National Economic Council, told reporters Tuesday evening that the administration was also hoping to take action to assist workers who don't have paid sick leave, though he said that could be done without Congress.

The House Democratic plan calls for up to three months of paid leave for workers who are infected, in quarantine, taking care of children, or caring for a loved one who is sick, according to a congressional aide. It would replace two-thirds of wages with a $4,000 a month cap for workers not already receiving wages or paid leave, according to the aide. The plan also includes roughly $1 billion in assistance for nutrition programs, according to a person familiar with the proposal.

White House officials were still reviewing the House proposal Wednesday night, but a person familiar with the matter said some officials in the building weren't keen on it

Weinstein Sentenced to 23 Years In Prison for Sexual Assaults

Harvey Weinstein, the once-powerful and internationally acclaimed Hollywood producer, was sentenced to 23 years in prison following a conviction stemming from sexual-assault allegations that sparked the #MeToo movement.

The sentence marks a shocking turn for Mr. Weinstein, 67 years old, who was viewed as one of Hollywood's most skilled executives until a wave of women accused him of sexual misconduct beginning in 2017. His Oscar-winning hits included "Shakespeare in Love" and "Pulp Fiction."

A Manhattan jury convicted Mr. Weinstein last month on two counts: first-degree criminal sexual act, for forcing oral sex on "Project Runway" production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006; and third-degree rape, for having nonconsensual sex with then-aspiring actress Jessica Mann in 2013.

He was acquitted of the most severe charges -- two counts of predatory sexual assault, which carried a possible life sentence. The jury ultimately decided against convicting Mr. Weinstein of raping former "Sopranos" star Annabella Sciorra in the early 1990s.

New York Supreme Court Justice James Burke sentenced Mr. Weinstein to 20 years on the charge of criminal sexual act and three years on the third-degree rape, to be served back to back. The maximum sentence for each count was 25 years and four years, respectively.

The judge said the sentence reflected evidence that Mr. Weinstein had sexually assaulted other women beyond the allegations for which he was convicted.

"Although this is a first conviction, it is not a first offense," Justice Burke said.

The Hollywood producer, who arrived by wheelchair, addressed the allegations for the first time in court, expressing "great remorse for all the women who are going through this crisis," but not apologizing or admitting he committed a crime.

He said the #MeToo movement had stripped men of due process and compared it to how communists were once treated.

"Now, there are thousands of men who have been accused of things that none of us understood," he said.

Turning to the front row, where six women who testified against him sat with Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, he said: "My empathy has grown."

Mr. Weinstein still faces criminal prosecution on similar allegations in Los Angeles, where the district attorney's office said Wednesday it had begun the process of extraditing him from New York and bringing him to California for court proceedings. He has denied any nonconsensual sexual encounters.

Mr. Weinstein's accusers wept and embraced each other after Justice Burke imposed the sentence and deemed him a convicted sex offender.

Spectators cheered in the courthouse hallway as the women walked out of the courtroom for the last time.

Mr. Weinstein, promptly wheeled out of the room by court officers, was "blown away" by the harsh sentence, according to defense attorney Arthur Aidala.

He said 23 years is three times the average sentence for the crime the producer was convicted of. His attorneys plan to appeal his conviction.

He was taken to Manhattan's Rikers Island jail facility Wednesday and is expected to be transferred to Fishkill Correctional Facility, a prison about 65 miles north of New York City, his lawyers said.

The sentence followed a seven-week trial.

Prosecutors called 28 witnesses to the stand, including six women who offered gripping testimony alleging sexual misconduct by Mr. Weinstein. The defense team tried to undermine the women during lengthy cross examinations, pointing to their yearslong consensual relationships that continued after the alleged attacks. Both Ms. Haley and Ms. Mann gave impassioned statements to the court describing the impact of Mr. Weinstein's crimes.

Ms. Haley described how her assault altered the course of her life and said she was confident Mr. Weinstein would continue to offend if he wasn't behind bars.

"I am relieved to know he's not out there, feeling even more empowered," she said. "He will now know he's not above the law."

During the proceeding, Mr. Weinstein turned toward Ms. Mann when she began delivering a statement about a sexual assault that occurred during their yearslong relationship. The hairstylist recounted Mr. Weinstein's "ox-like" strength and explained that "fight and flight" weren't possible during her attack. She described her testimony as painful but empowering.

"Rape is not just one moment of penetration," she said. "The impact will last a lifetime."

Lead defense attorney Donna Rotunno had asked Justice Burke to sentence Mr. Weinstein to the minimum of five years, citing his professional accomplishments and the impact his incarceration would have on his youngest children, aged six and nine. Given his age and deteriorating health, it is possible he wouldn't live to see the end of a five-year sentence.

But Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi said Mr. Weinstein had been "using and abusing people his entire life," reading from a lengthy list of quotes describing him: "a devil," "a frightening power addict," "a screaming bully," "extremely temperamental," "a rapist."

"This is the life this man has led," she said.

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. budget deficit totaled $625 billion in the first five months of this fiscal year, a 15% increase over the same period in 2019, the U.S. Treasury reported Wednesday.

The deficit grew by $235 billion in February, roughly on par with February 2019. The U.S. fiscal year begins in October.

Government revenue rose to $188 billion in February, a 12% increase over the same month in 2019. For the whole five-month period, revenue rose 7% to $1.37 trillion, thanks to a strong economy that fattened payrolls and delivered wage gains.

Spending is also up this fiscal year, climbing 9% to $1.99 trillion. The rise in spending was largely driven by outlays in health care and Social Security spending as well as more spending on the military and veterans' affairs.

Deficits typically narrow when the economy is strong, as rising household income and corporate profits bolster government revenue, and spending on safety-net programs such as unemployment insurance declines. Instead, deficits have been rising in recent years amid a surge in government spending and weaker-than-expected receipts following the tax cuts enacted in 2017.

The government expects the deficit to hit $1.08 trillion this fiscal year, up from $984 billion during the 2019 fiscal year.

Trump Curtails Travel From Europe

WASHINGTON -- President Trump announced a 30-day ban on some travel from Europe into the U.S. and said he would take action to offer financial assistance to those affected by the coronavirus pandemic in an effort to mitigate the impact of the virus that is rapidly spreading across the country and around the world.

Mr. Trump, in a nationally televised address from the Oval Office on Wednesday, said the travel suspension would begin Friday night at midnight and wouldn't apply to the U.K.

The president suggested the restrictions would also apply to cargo shipped into the U.S. from Europe, but the White House later said the restrictions applied only to people and declined to answer other questions.

"The restriction stops people not goods," Mr. Trump later tweeted.

The president's comments came as the virus has spread to more than 100 countries, roiled markets and disrupted daily life across the country and around the world.

By Wednesday night, global confirmed cases had grown to 126,135, more than 1,300 of them in the U.S., data compiled by Johns Hopkins University showed. More than 4,600 people have died.

Mr. Trump's address marked his most direct response to the health crisis to date, though he tried to sound an optimistic note and defended the actions that have already been taken by his administration.

"This is not a financial crisis," Mr. Trump said. "This is just a temporary moment in time that we will overcome as a nation, and as a world."

U.S. futures and global stock markets dropped after the president announced the new travel restrictions.

Hours after Mr. Trump's address, the State Department advised U.S. citizens against all travel abroad, even to countries not yet experiencing a coronavirus outbreak. The department warned of mandatory quarantines, travel restrictions and other measures that could complicate international travel.

The restrictions and the travel warning were sure to hurt the airline industry, which has seen travel plummet as the virus has taken hold.

The Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday night said the travel-restriction proclamation signed by the president applies to most foreign nationals who have been in European countries at any point during the 14 days prior to their scheduled arrival to the United States.

The ban applies to the 26 European countries in the Schengen Area, a zone without border controls where people can travel freely from country to country. The U.K. is not inside the Schengen Area, though the country hasn't escaped coronavirus.

U.S. citizens and green-card holders are exempted from the temporary ban, as are their spouses and children. Citizens and green-card holders who are under the age of 21 are also eligible to bring parents into the U.S. Passengers on flights that take off Friday before midnight will still be eligible to enter the U.S., even if they land after the ban takes effect.

Europe is the most-visited regional destination for U.S. travelers in the world, according to U.S. Transportation Department data. More than 72 million passengers traveled from the U.S. to Europe in the year ending June 2019.

Airlines scrambled to understand what Mr. Trump's announcement would mean for their operations. Carriers have already announced cuts to flying capacity all over the world due to flagging demand, but had planned to continue operating some flights to and from Europe.

"We are in contact with the federal government to understand and comply with this directive. The health and safety of our customers and team members remains our highest priority," American Airlines Group Inc. said in a statement.

Mr. Trump, who spoke for about 10 minutes, also said he would ask Congress to take emergency action "to ensure that working Americans impacted by the virus can stay home without fear of financial hardship." He said aid would be targeted for workers who are ill, quarantined or caring for others.

Last year, 24% of U.S. workers, or about 33.6 million Americans, did not receive paid sick leave from their employer, the Labor Department said. Those without the benefit are concentrated in lower-wage and front-line service sector positions.

Mr. Trump also said he would instruct the Internal Revenue Service to push back the April 15 tax-payment deadline for certain individuals and businesses, providing a cash cushion for taxpayers at a time when the economy may falter.

Mr. Trump said the Small Business Administration would begin offering low-interest loans to help small businesses overcome temporary economic disruptions. He said the administration planned to ask Congress to authorize an additional $50 billion for the lending program.

The president urged Congress to approve payroll tax relief, a proposal that faces resistance from Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill.

Mr. Trump said insurers had agreed to waive copayment for coronavirus treatment. But America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group for the industry, pointed to a press conference Tuesday where Vice President Mike Pence said insurers had agreed only to waive copays for coronavirus testing.

Mr. Trump faces not only a national health problem but a political test as he heads deeper into the re-election campaign. His chief rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, is set to give a speech on coronavirus Thursday in Wilmington, Del.

After the president's address, the White House said that out of caution over the coronavirus, Mr. Trump canceled travel for events in Colorado and Nevada that was to begin Thursday.

Earlier in the day, the president said at a meeting with banking executives at the White House that one of the reasons the virus was spreading rapidly was the ease with which travelers can cross borders, according to people familiar with the matter.

The IRS Proves the Left's Favorite Economists Wrong

'The Rich Really Do Pay Lower Taxes Than You" read a headline in the New York Times last fall. This astounding claim, presented in the media as fact and evidence of inequities baked into President Trump's 2017 tax cut, came from two economists at the University of California, Berkeley. Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman asserted that 2018 was the first year in U.S. history that the average tax rate on the 400 wealthiest income earners dipped below the rates paid by the lower-middle class and poor.

Finally, we had proof the rich weren't paying their fair share. But new data from the Internal Revenue Service suggest it isn't true.

The Saez-Zucman analysis raised eyebrows among other economists who study tax data, in part because they claimed it reflected the first full year under the new tax rates. At the time they published their study, the IRS had yet to release the data necessary to make the calculations they described. Preliminary numbers for 2018 income-tax returns, covering all filings made by last year's Oct. 15 extended deadline, came out only last week. These data tell a very different story: America's wealthiest earners still carry the lion's share of the tax burden.

Closer inspection reveals that Messrs. Saez and Zucman imputed the tax rates they claim for 2018 from records that predated the Trump tax cut, and therefore didn't capture its effect on the measured distribution of income. They built in opaque assumptions that now appear to have exaggerated the tax cut's benefit to high-income earners.

This wasn't the only problem with the Saez-Zucman statistics. Their alleged 23% tax rate paid by the highest earners -- encompassing all federal, state and local taxes -- fell below the Congressional Budget Office's estimates for the top income percentile's federal tax rate alone. The two economists' tax rates for the poor also looked suspiciously high. A 25% rate for the lowest quintile of earners would be almost twice the level found in other estimates, including those using better-established data from the Congressional Budget Office and the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. The discrepancy arose from Messrs. Saez and Zucman's exclusion of the earned-income tax credit for low-income households, artificially inflating the amount of tax the poor really pay.

The new IRS numbers now provide reason to doubt Messrs. Saez and Zucman's entire narrative of a regressive U.S. tax system designed to favor the rich at the expense of the poor. The IRS reports effective income-tax rates on the adjusted gross incomes of different groups of earners. That's the percentage of income that people actually pay to the government, as distinct from the statutory tax rate.

According to the IRS, the top 0.01% of earners -- those with incomes above $10 million -- paid a 24.8% effective federal income-tax rate in 2018. This isn't very different from the 25.3% the group paid in 2017, and is higher than the average rate of 22.5% on the same group during the George W. Bush administration. As these rates only encompass federal income taxes, most filers can expect to add another 8% to 12% of income from other forms of taxation, placing their total burden well above the Saez-Zucman numbers.

How does that affect the claims of regressivity? It's true the remainder of the top 1% (those with incomes between roughly $500,000 and $10 million) paid a slightly higher effective rate, at 26.5%, than the top 0.01% did. But tax rates drop rapidly from there, with filers in the $50,000 to $75,000 reporting bracket (approximately the median U.S. family income) facing an average federal income-tax rate of 8.4%.

People who earned between $15,000 and $40,000 paid an average federal rate of merely 4% of their adjusted gross incomes in 2018. And thanks to the earned-income tax credit and others like it, the poorest earners paid very little if any federal income tax at all.

In short, the federal income-tax structure still places the unambiguous bulk of its burden on the highest earners. The Trump tax cut hasn't changed that. In 2018, the top 1% of U.S. earners paid roughly 37% of all federal income taxes. The top 5% paid around 58%. This suggests that policy makers wishing to mitigate regressive features of the tax system should look elsewhere. State and local sales and property taxes may be a more promising area for reform.

The IRS's preliminary data also suggests that the needle on income inequality -- the motive force behind the Saez-Zucman research and the wealth-tax proposals it has been used to support -- hasn't moved lately. The share of adjusted gross income that went to the top 1% in 2018 was essentially the same as it was a decade earlier, at least going by the IRS numbers. The same is true of the top 0.1% and even the top 0.01%, the ultrarich so often targeted in political rhetoric from the left.

The full economic effects of the Trump tax cut extend beyond personal income-tax rates, and will be seen in the data only when future statistical releases become available. The corporate income-tax cut, for example, will likely prompt high earners to shift income from their personal returns to corporate returns, further lowering the measured income shares of the top 1%. Ironically, the reduction in the corporate tax rate could lead to a statistical reduction in income inequality.

In their rush to embrace a convenient political narrative last fall, much of the press and political classes never considered the possibility that the data would undermine their story. It did.

U.S. News: Home Sales Face New Uncertainty

The lowest mortgage rates on record are colliding with the prospect of an economic downturn prompted by the coronavirus pandemic, setting the stage for an unpredictable spring selling season in the housing market.

Early indications suggest rock-bottom borrowing costs may not be enough to lure many home buyers amid the current uncertainty. Economists are tamping down earlier expectations that cheap rates and a strong job market would boost the housing market in 2020 following years of sluggish growth.

The National Association of Realtors had anticipated about 5.5 million sales of previously owned homes in 2020, up from 5.3 million a year in 2019 and 2018, said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun.

"I thought that there would be a steady increase from January pretty much throughout most of the year," Mr. Yun said. "Obviously, we hit a major speed bump" because of the new coronavirus.

The association said Monday that it expected a 10% drop in home sales in the next month, compared with the period before the coronavirus became prominent. In a survey of its members about the virus, the association said 11% of respondents reported lower home-buyer traffic and 7% reported lower home-seller traffic.

The spring months are crucial for home sales, as buyers look to move into new homes before the start of the school year. About 40% of annual sales take place from March through June, according to NAR.

Some agents say the virus is causing clients to avoid public gatherings, including open houses.

David Kong, an agent at real-estate brokerage Keller Williams NYC, got a call last week from a client asking to cancel her open house. The client, Jodi Freed, a party planner from Queens, N.Y., said she was concerned about having strangers in the home where she and her family still live, because her teenage children have health conditions.

"It's pretty much put our life on hold," she said. "If I can't sell the house, I can't move."

Real-estate brokerage Redfin Corp. said last week that a handful of buyers had suspended their home searches due to the virus, while three sellers in Seattle canceled listings. Redfin has encouraged home shoppers to use video chat to tour homes virtually.

The biggest problem in the housing market is a shortage of homes for sale, "and the coronavirus I think will exacerbate that, because it's the sellers who are hesitant to put their homes on the market," said Redfin Chief Executive Glenn Kelman.

The U.S. housing inventory in January was at the lowest level for that month since 1999, according to NAR. The U.S. had 3.1 months of supply of homes on the market at the end of January, down from 3.8 months a year earlier.

In February, the number of homes for sale fell by more than 20% in half of the nation's 50 biggest metro areas compared with a year earlier, according to Realtor.com. (News Corp, parent of The Wall Street Journal, operates Realtor.com.)

The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 3.29% last week, the lowest level on record, said mortgage-finance giant Freddie Mac. Mortgages rates are closely linked to yields on the 10-year Treasury, which hit a record low Monday.

Low mortgage rates have led to a boom in refinancing, and they typically increase home sales too. A 3.3% rate on a $300,000 loan would create a monthly payment of $1,314, according to LendingTree Inc., an online loan information site. At 4%, the monthly payment would be $1,432. (Both figures exclude taxes and insurance.)

King County, Wash., which includes Seattle, has confirmed more than 100 Covid-19 cases, and some schools have closed. But the housing market hasn't slowed, said Matt van Winkle, chief executive of Re/Max Northwest.

"We're still seeing properties sell in the first day or two when they come on the market," he said.

Adam Schiff's Surveillance State

Lawmakers are debating ways to prevent the Federal Bureau of Investigation from abusing its surveillance authority again. While they're at it, they have an obligation to address their own privacy transgressor, Rep. Adam Schiff.

That's the gist of a pointed letter from Federal Communications Commissioner Brendan Carr, which landed Thursday at the House Intelligence Committee. Chairman Schiff spent months conducting secret impeachment hearings. His ensuing report revealed that he'd also set up his own surveillance state. Mr. Schiff issued secret subpoenas to phone carriers, to obtain and publish the call records of political rivals. Targets included Rudy Giuliani and another attorney of the president, the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee (Rep. Devin Nunes) and a journalist (John Solomon).

Impeachment is over, but Mr. Carr hasn't forgotten this abuse of power, and his letter, which I obtained, calls for answers and reform. The FCC takes call privacy seriously, only recently having proposed some $200 million in fines on phone carriers for failing to protect customer data. Mr. Carr's message to Mr. Schiff is that Congress doesn't get a pass. It is not automatically entitled to "a secret and partisan process that deprives Americans of their legal right to maintain the privacy of this sensitive information."

Mr. Carr doesn't dispute that Congress may, "in at least some circumstances," have the legal authority to obtain call records under the Communications Act. The offense, he writes, was denying his targets the right to fight the subpoenas: "Courts long ago established a process for Americans to seek judicial review before Congress obtains and then publishes documents in response to a congressional subpoena."

As a lawyer and congressional lifer, Mr. Schiff knows this. It's expected that Congress give notice of demands, as it did when it issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Mazars for Donald Trump's financial records. That notice allowed the president to file suit to block those institutions from responding. The Supreme Court in December issued stays, halting Deutsche Bank and Mazars compliance while it considers Mr. Trump's appeal. Oral arguments are scheduled for March 31. Congress isn't entitled to everything.

This history is what made Mr. Schiff's subpoenas so devious and abusive. He issued them secretly. He didn't notify his targets, and Republican committee members were barred from telling the public what they knew about the subpoenas.

Worse, he deceived one of his targets. He sent a subpoena for call records to Mr. Giuliani on Sept. 30 and suggested Mr. Giuliani had two weeks to work with the committee, even as Mr. Schiff was already secretly demanding Giuliani call records from a phone carrier.

House Democrats suggest this cloak-and-dagger was necessary for their investigation. Mr. Carr punctures that absurd claim. Yes, law enforcement sometimes needs secrecy in surveillance warrants, so as to freely monitor "real time" on continuing communications. But Mr. Schiff was seeking past call data. Telling Mr. Giuliani about the carrier subpoenas wouldn't change the call-record history. The only reason to keep him in the dark was to strip him of the right to litigate.

Mr. Carr details how many legal issues Mr. Schiff denied his targets the opportunity to test. He notes that the Supreme Court is considering the limits on congressional subpoena authority in Trump v. Mazars and Trump v. Deutsche Bank, and that the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia last month dismissed a House lawsuit to compel testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn. Mr. Carr also points out the heightened First Amendment questions that accompanied Mr. Schiff's acquisition and publication of records for an investigative journalist -- one who was writing stories critical of Mr. Schiff.

And he asks whether Mr. Schiff exceeded his authority by publishing call records that lack "any apparent nexus to the Committee's legitimate work." That includes a drive-by smear of Mr. Nunes. In Watkins v. U.S. (1957), the Supreme Court held that "there is no congressional power to expose for the sake of exposure," especially when "the predominant result can only be the invasion of the private rights of individuals."

Meanwhile, Mr. Carr asks: Is Mr. Schiff continuing to issue secret subpoenas? And what else is he sitting on? The impeachment report indicates the committee obtained "nearly 4,000 pages of confidential call records," nowhere near what Mr. Schiff published. Who else's life is getting ransacked at this moment?

"The Committee created out of whole cloth a secret and effectively unreviewable and unchecked mechanism for obtaining call records on any and all Americans," Mr. Carr writes. He holds out the possibility the FCC will modify its rules to check such abuse.

But he also suggests Congress take the question up as part of its surveillance debate. That's the better forum, and it ought to be as big a priority for Republicans as reform of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The House has little credibility to lecture the FBI on surveillance abuse if it won't rein in its own snoopers.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Travel Ban Fuels Tensions With Europe

Corrections & Amplifications

The European Commission president and European Council president said in a statement: "The European Union disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation." A Coronavirus Pandemic article Friday about tensions between the U.S. and the EU incorrectly quoted the statement as saying improve rather than impose.

(WSJ March 14, 2020)

(END)

President Trump's announced travel ban on Europe, beyond surprising European capitals, deepens tensions among trans-Atlantic allies whose ties already are strained over trade, security, climate change and what Europeans say is the U.S. failure to consult them.

European governments complained that the announcement, made early Thursday Europe time, came without notice and coordination on what is a global health problem. Moreover, the U.S. ban, European Union leaders said, directly affects European citizens, barring many of them from travel to the U.S., and disregards the EU's "strong action" to contain the new coronavirus.

Mr. Trump defended the ban and the timing, saying the situation demanded fast action so not all European leaders could be notified.

"We had to make a decision and I didn't want to take time, and, you know, it takes a lot of time to make the individual calls, and we are calling, and we have spoken to some of them prior to. . . . But we had to move quickly," Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he met with the prime minister of Ireland, whose citizens aren't affected by the ban.

The ban -- which covers most non-U.S. citizens who have traveled through 26 European countries -- comes on top of other U.S. decisions made unilaterally under Mr. Trump that have dismayed European leaders.

Some decisions, including the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate accord and the multinational Iran nuclear deal, followed pledges Mr. Trump made during his 2016 run for president.

Other decisions, such as his placing of tariffs on European steel and aluminum, which Mr. Trump justified on national-security grounds, stunned EU leaders, who note that Europe contributes to U.S. security by participating in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other alliances.

Mr. Trump has jangled European nerves by criticizing those contributions as insufficient and by threatening to impose tariffs on European cars, also on national-security grounds.

EU leaders and officials said imposing the travel ban without consultation is particularly counterproductive because governments need to work together to stem the spread of the new coronavirus.

Mr. Trump's decision rankled further because he said the EU failed to restrict travel from China and contain the virus, which, he said, then seeded outbreaks in the U.S.

The EU wouldn't comment on Mr. Trump's comments.

German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said: "I believe we are dealing with a global issue and a global challenge. We don't do it justice, including in the U.S., by taking decisions that are garnished with blame."

The coronavirus crisis "requires cooperation rather than unilateral action," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel said in a statement. "The European Union disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to improve a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation."

A spokesman for the European Commission, the EU's executive, said officials were still seeking to understand the scope and consequences of the U.S. decision. Eric Mamer, the chief spokesman said there were no immediate plans for any retaliatory steps but didn't rule that out.

Mr. Trump repeatedly has accused the EU and European countries of taking advantage of the U.S. on defense and trade. European nations have pledged significant defense spending increases. On trade, the two sides recently hoped to reach agreement later this month to avert fresh U.S. tariffs on EU products, though that target date now looks doubtful.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: High Court Is Closed To Public For Now

WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court and other federal courts in the nation's capital will close to the public indefinitely, allowing access only to those with official business, as authorities tried to stanch the coronavirus pandemic.

"Out of concern for the health and safety of the public and Supreme Court employees, the Supreme Court Building will be closed to the public from 4:30 p.m. on March 12, 2020, until further notice," the Supreme Court said Thursday.

The landmark building opposite the Capitol is a major tourist attraction, and its public floors include exhibits and offer lectures and educational programs. Those have been canceled indefinitely, the court said.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, the U.S. District Court and the federal bankruptcy court, which are based at the E. Barrett Prettyman Courthouse, announced a similar policy.

The courts are not suspending their own business. The Supreme Court advised attorneys that case filing deadlines weren't being extended.

Credentialed journalists will be able to enter court buildings, but the level of public access to proceedings was unclear. The Sixth Amendment provides criminal defendants "the right to a speedy and public trial," and the Supreme Court has held that the public has a right to attend such proceedings.

In May 2018, under a policy spearheaded by then-Chief Judge Merrick Garland, the D.C. Circuit began streaming live audio of all its arguments through the court website. The district court, which conducts trials, doesn't provide audio of its proceedings. A district court spokeswoman couldn't be reached.

The Supreme Court is next scheduled to hear oral arguments on March 23, beginning a two-week sitting that will include several significant cases, including legal actions filed by President Trump to prevent Deutsche Bank AG and the Mazars accounting firm from turning over his financial records under subpoenas from House committees and a New York state grand jury.

The moves in Washington, D.C., come as federal courts across the country have been limiting access to courtrooms and delaying trials and proceedings. In Washington state, with one of the most severe outbreaks in the U.S., the federal courts have postponed all in-person civil and criminal proceedings in Seattle and Tacoma, and suspended grand jury meetings.

PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron delivered a national address that called for international cooperation in the fight against the new coronavirus.

Speaking on national television Thursday, Mr. Macron cast France's struggle to slow the rate of infections as an effort that would require collective national action.

He announced a nationwide shutdown of the school system starting Monday and urged people over the age of 70 and anyone with chronic diseases or respiratory ailments to remain at home.

"We are only at the beginning of the epidemic. Everywhere in Europe it is accelerating," Mr. Macron said.

However Mr. Macron also portrayed the coronavirus as a challenge in need of a global solution, just one day after President Trump described it as a foreign virus that had arrived on U.S. shores.

"This virus doesn't have a passport," Mr. Macron said, adding that he planned to speak to Mr. Trump on Friday. "Being divided won't allow us to respond to what's a global crisis."

Mr. Macron said he might need to limit travel to areas in France that are severely affected by the virus. Any decision to close national borders, Mr. Macron said, will occur "only when relevant" and will be coordinated "at the European level."

The Coronavirus Pandmemic: ECB Offers Stimulus, but Plan Draws Criticism

FRANKFURT -- European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde unveiled a modest stimulus package to shield the region's economy from the fast-spreading coronavirus, but the action raised concerns the central bank may be unwilling or unable to move forcefully against a shock that has ricocheted through Europe.

Ms. Lagarde emphasized the limits of what the ECB can do to mitigate the economic damage of the virus, remarks that suggested she might be less willing to use the sort of extraordinary measures that her predecessor, Mario Draghi, rolled out.

Some analysts immediately compared her performance unfavorably with that of Mr. Draghi, whose promise to do "whatever it takes" to preserve the euro helped end the region's debt crisis during his tenure.

The ECB said it would roll out cheap loans for banks, at an interest rate as low as minus 0.75%, and step up bond purchases under its 2.6 trillion euros ($2.9 trillion) bond-buying program.

But the bank left its key interest rate unchanged at minus 0.5%. Investors had widely expected the ECB to cut rates by at least 0.1 percentage point, after major central banks including the Federal Reserve and Bank of England announced aggressive rate cuts in recent days.

"The overall scale of the package, given that the economy is likely heading for recession, is modest," said Nick Kounis, an analyst with Dutch bank ABN Amro.

Instead, Ms. Lagarde called repeatedly on the region's governments to take on more of the burden of supporting growth. Crucially, she indicated that the ECB wouldn't step in to support Southern European governments if they came under pressure from investors.

"We are not here to close spreads. There are other tools and other actors to deal with these issues," Ms. Lagarde said.

European stock indexes fell, the euro tumbled against the dollar and yields of Italian 10-year government bonds jumped to the highest level in months.

"How can she say such a thing? The ECB should never say this," tweeted Guntram Wolff, a German economist who is the director of Brussels think tank Bruegel. "We have just massively increased the risks of a euro-area crisis resulting from the Covid19 shock. OMG."

In a subsequent TV interview, Ms. Lagarde sought to redirect her remarks, saying that the ECB would seek to avoid the fragmentation of the eurozone and that its tools were available to Italy.

But the mixed messages underscored to investors the limitations of an ECB steered by Ms. Lagarde, an attorney and former French finance minister who is the only ECB president without prior central-bank experience. Investors grew to count on wave after wave of monetary stimulus from Frankfurt during Mr. Draghi's eight-year term, which ended in October.

"The bigger concern is that it shows how unfamiliar she still is with language, which especially in such stressful times is not helpful," said Oliver Rakau, an economist with Oxford Economics.

The ECB is seeking to support a eurozone economy that is likely headed for recession, dragged down by business bottlenecks, softening consumer demand and the lockdown of the region's third-biggest economy, Italy.

The eurozone economy could shrink 1.2% in 2020, according to research firm Capital Economics.

Thursday's decision comes amid a deep split in the ECB, which Ms. Lagarde could struggle to bridge.

Many ECB officials are worried about the adverse side effects of a long period of easy money and the pressure negative rates place on banks.

World News: Decision On Pell's Appeal Is Delayed

CANBERRA, Australia -- Australia's highest court withheld its decision on an appeal by former Vatican finance chief Cardinal George Pell of his conviction for child sex abuse, prolonging a legal battle that has bitterly divided Australian society and Catholics around the world.

Cardinal Pell is the highest-ranking Catholic official to be convicted of child-sex crimes. The 78-year-old prelate is serving a six-year prison sentence after a jury found him guilty of assaulting two 13-year-old choirboys in a Melbourne cathedral while he was archbishop in the 1990s.

This week's appeal was potentially the last bid to clear his name. During two days of hearings, the High Court heard arguments from Cardinal Pell's lawyers as to why the appeal should be allowed, and arguments from the prosecution for upholding his conviction.

The judges decided Thursday to reserve their decision, meaning they won't offer a verdict yet. Reserving judgment gives the judges more time to consider the arguments and make written statements outlining their reasons.

They could acquit the cardinal or uphold his conviction, or they could send the case to be reheard at the Victoria Court of Appeals. It may be days or months before the High Court releases its decision. If the judges believe an innocent person is behind bars, they could make an order soon, paving the way for his release, and publish the reasons later, experts said.

Outside the court in Canberra, Cardinal Pell's supporters sang hymns and waved Australian flags and signs saying "Keep the Faith" and "May the Australian legal system be inspired by the Holy Spirit." An advocate for abuse victims held up a sign saying: "Burn in Hell Pell."

The cardinal was convicted by a unanimous verdict in December 2018 after a jury in an earlier trial was deadlocked. In August 2019, a panel of appellate judges in Victoria state ruled 2-1 to uphold his conviction.

The prosecution case relied on the evidence of one of the former choirboys, now in his 30s with a young family. He reported the abuses to the police in 2015, after his friend died from an accidental drug overdose. The other choirboy never publicly made accusations against Cardinal Pell.

The Holy See has reserved judgment until the appeal process is exhausted, even as it continues to be roiled by allegations of clerical sex abuse around the world.

World News: U.S. Strikes Iran-Backed Militia in Iraq

The U.S. conducted a series of airstrikes against an Iran-backed militia group in Iraq, U.S. officials said Thursday, entering into a new phase of a military confrontation with Iran and its allies by retaliating for the deaths earlier this week of two Americans and a British service member.

The U.S. strikes targeted five weapons-storage facilities in Iraq associated with Kataib Hezbollah, a Shiite militia group that U.S. officials said has frequently targeted Iraqi bases where American service members are based.

The strikes aimed to degrade the group's ability to conduct future attacks against U.S. and coalition forces, the Pentagon said in a statement. It gave no estimate of casualties among members of the militia, but officials estimated there were as many as three to four dozen casualties.

The U.S. had been consulting with the British government on the operation, but the retaliatory strikes were conducted by U.S. forces alone, U.S. officials said.

The strikes were "defensive and proportional," the Pentagon said, and were in response to the threats posed by Iranian-backed militias operating in Iraq. The U.S. has about 5,000 troops based in Iraq.

"The United States will not tolerate attacks against our people, our interests, or our allies," Defense Secretary Mark Esper said. "As we have demonstrated in recent months, we will take any action necessary to protect our forces in Iraq and the region."

A TV channel linked to the Kataib Hezbollah militia said four paramilitary fighters had been wounded and two federal policemen killed, along with a civilian who was hit in a strike on an airport under construction. The toll couldn't immediately be independently verified and the Iraqi government did not comment on the attack. Iranian officials did not respond to a request for comment.

The U.S. strikes came after a series of attacks in recent weeks against bases in Iraq where American military personnel are stationed. Before Wednesday, those strikes had not been considered successful by U.S. officials. Wednesday's strike at Camp Taji, north of Baghdad, killed the two Americans and the British service member, and wounded more than a dozen others, spurring the U.S. to act.

U.S. commanders consulted with the White House Thursday before conducting the strikes early on Friday morning in Iraq, officials said.

Before the U.S. strikes, military officials did not identify which group they believed had carried out the attack on Camp Taji, and no group had claimed responsibility. Two Iran-backed militias praised the attack. Kataib Hezbollah, which the U.S. has blamed for previous rocket attacks, congratulated the perpetrators and urged other militias to follow their example. The group said the U.S. must face the consequences of staying in Iraq after the country's parliament passed a nonbinding resolution in favor of their expulsion earlier this year.

The rocket attack on Wednesday drew fresh attention to the hostile environment for U.S. forces in Iraq, where they have repeatedly come under fire in recent months. It also put Iraq back in the crosshairs of a potential flare-up in the simmering conflict between Washington and Tehran. Iraq has proved unable or unwilling to meet U.S. and allied demands in the past to rein in activities of militias.

Tensions had recently eased since flaring in January after the U.S. killed a top Iranian commander, Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, in an airstrike after he arrived at Baghdad airport.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: As China Recovers, It Scrutinizes Foreigners

BEIJING -- As China grows more optimistic about containing the spread of coronavirus within the country, it is confronting a potential threat to its recovery: the rest of the world.

Epidemic-control efforts have turned to foreigners in China in recent days as confirmed cases within the country have slowed. Police officers and local government workers have made house calls specifically to check whether expatriates recently traveled to another country where they could have contracted the virus.

The shift in focus comes as China attempts to recast the coronavirus as a global issue and touts its own handling of the epidemic. The government's draconian but seemingly effective lockdowns of cities have helped reduce person-to-person contact and slow the spread of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.

Meanwhile, the World Health Organization on Wednesday declared the new coronavirus a pandemic. Confirmed cases are rising in other parts of Asia, the U.S. and Europe, and more than 4,500 people have died globally, with the majority of them in China. All of Italy was placed under quarantine on Tuesday; the virus's death toll there rose above 1,000 on Thursday, and the number of infected patients topped 15,000.

Within China, imported cases outnumbered domestic cases outside Hubei province for six consecutive days as of Wednesday, the National Health Commission said. In one week, total imported cases rose to 85 from 20 on Wednesday. Beijing authorities said Wednesday that one imported case had come from the U.S.

"The number of these imported cases is likely to increase," said Hitoshi Oshitani, a professor of virology at Japan's Tohoku University School of Medicine. "That may trigger another large outbreak in China."

The emphasis on limiting international exposures has bolstered the perception that China has efficiently and effectively addressed the outbreak -- a narrative the government has promoted, despite initially playing down the virus's spread for weeks before taking decisive action.

Beijing criticized some countries, notably the U.S., for raising travel alerts against China and for chartering flights to evacuate their citizens. As the virus has spread more quickly outside China than inside, the Chinese government itself has evacuated its overseas citizens, including 200 Chinese nationals from Iran, where 8,000 people have been infected.

On Monday, Beijing authorities asked foreigners in particular to minimize unnecessary travel and to wear masks outside, saying the pressure has mounted to control imported cases of infection as the epidemic worsens globally. The week before, they had said anyone arriving from South Korea, Italy, Iran or Japan -- countries battling recent surges in infections -- would have to quarantine for 14 days.

And on Wednesday, Beijing officials ordered anyone entering China -- even from countries with nonserious virus conditions -- to confine themselves at home for 14 days, effective immediately. Short-term travelers entering China will be required to stay in designated hotels and to submit to nucleic acid testing, and are forbidden from leaving the hotel until test results are obtained.

On the ground, foreigners have sometimes been singled out. In a Beijing neighborhood near the Forbidden City, local government workers delivered a message to two Americans living in adjacent bungalows last week, translated into English and shown to them on a cellphone: "Don't have too much contact with foreign friends to avoid spreading the disease." The workers didn't contact their Chinese neighbors.

In Shanghai, Jared T. Nelson, who runs a compliance startup, said he has received visits from local police at home and his office inquiring about any recent travel abroad.

On Saturday, two policemen knocked on Mr. Nelson's apartment door to ask when he returned to the city. When he told them about his January trip to Hangzhou, a coastal city 100 miles southwest of Shanghai, they said it didn't count. They asked about trips outside China, and explained that they were checking foreigners in the area who might need to undergo quarantine. They left after inspecting the passport of Mr. Nelson, who hasn't been abroad since 2018.

"There's a perception that everything is under control here, but out of control abroad," the 36-year-old Wyoming native said. "All of us who are obviously foreign -- we're potentially carriers."

Virus Batters Economy --- Dow posts worst day since 1987 as outbreak's impact deepens

The U.S. and world economies look increasingly likely to slip into recession as swaths of commerce shut down and the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its worst day since 1987 amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The global financial rout deepened Thursday despite new measures by major central banks to ease market strains and bolster the economy. The Trump administration and Congress, meanwhile, were close to agreement on legislation to provide federal financial assistance to many affected businesses and workers, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said.

The Dow industrials fell nearly 10%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq joined it in bear-market territory. For the day, the Dow industrials shed 2352.6 points to 21200.62. The S&P 500 sank 260.74 points, or 9.5%, to 2480.64. And the Nasdaq Composite slid 750.25 points, or 9.4% to 7201.80. (By comparison, the Dow fell 22.6% during the Black Monday crash, on Oct. 19, 1987.)

The selloff extended to U.S. futures Thursday night and Asian stocks on Friday morning. S&P and Dow futures were each down more than 2%. In early trading, Japan's Nikkei 225 Stock Average was down 9.3%, while South Korea's Kospi was down 7.5%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 6.3% and the Shanghai Composite was down 3.4%.

In the U.S. Thursday, airline and cruise company shares led the collapse. United Airlines Holdings was down 25%, Delta Air Lines dropped 21%, and Spirit Airlines dropped 33%. Royal Caribbean Cruises plummeted 32%.

European stocks suffered one of their worst days in decades, with the Stoxx Europe 600 index dropping 11.5% by day's end. This came after the European Central Bank said it would issue cheap loans to banks and buy more eurozone debt to mitigate the economic shock of the coronavirus -- but didn't cut its key interest rate, which is already below zero.

U.S. stocks initially pared their losses, but later resumed their fall after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it would inject more than $1.5 trillion into short-term funding markets on Thursday and Friday to prevent ominous trading conditions from creating a sharper economic contraction.

Across the U.S. -- the world's largest economy -- authorities this week have canceled or postponed a swelling number of commercial flights, industry conferences, music festivals, sports events and other public activities, while oil producers are being slammed by a drop in crude prices. All this increases the chances that the record-long economic expansion will end in coming months, economists said.

"We are going into a global recession. The necessary measures to contain the spread of the virus make that unavoidable," wrote Vitor Constancio, a former vice president of the European Central Bank, on Twitter Thursday.

In the U.S. alone, "the chances of a recession are going way up," said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase.

President Trump's announcement Wednesday night of a 30-day ban on some travel to the U.S. from Europe to contain the spread of the virus came as global air traffic was already falling.

While cancellations and postponements of public activities in the U.S. -- such as professional and college baseball, hockey and basketball games, Broadway shows and Austin's South by Southwest festival -- may help slow the spread of the virus, it will inevitably take a toll on consumer spending, economists said.

"It's going to be massively disruptive to the economy," said Joshua Shapiro of consulting firm MFR Inc.

"You go to a sporting event, not only do you buy a ticket. You buy some beers, maybe you go to dinner first. You go out afterwards. You're spending money," Mr. Shapiro said. "It's not just the ticket to the event, it's the plane ticket, it's the hotel. It's all these people working at these places."

As U.S. benchmark crude crashed to near $30 a barrel this week, shale firms announced a string of drilling and spending cuts that will squeeze hundreds of energy service companies that employ the bulk of the industry's workforce.

Apache Corp. said it would drop all of its rigs in the Permian basin of Texas and New Mexico, shift resources overseas and slash its quarterly dividend by 90%.

Matador Resources Co. plans to cut half of its drilling rigs by the end of June, while executives and board members take pay cuts.

Marathon Oil Corp. plans to slash at least $500 million in spending, halt all drilling and fracking in Oklahoma and reduce activity in the Permian, where it has four rigs and one fracking crew.

If enough producers throttle down all at once, and drilling rigs are idled for an extended period, energy-service firms will have to cut workers and prices, and over time, growing U.S. oil production would flatten and decline.

JPMorgan Chase said Thursday it now thinks the economy will fall into recession in the first half of this year, ending the expansion that began in 2009. It expects output to fall by an annual rate of 2% in the first quarter and by another 3% in the second quarter. The bank expects the economy to return to solid growth in the second half, assuming a "fiscal response" of $500 billion from Congress.

The Institute of International Finance predicts the global economy will grow about 1% this year, the smallest gain since the global financial crisis in 2009 and a level that would likely mean many countries would fall into recession.

A recession can take months to show up in economic data.

Most likely, it would first become visible in sentiment readings, new claims for unemployment insurance benefits, and eventually in spending and investment data.

Through last week, U.S. employers generally appeared to resist the urge to lay off workers. New jobless claims fell last week, to a historically low level of 211,000, the Labor Department said Thursday.

But IHS Markit said last week that business activity in the U.S. service sector -- representing industries from restaurants to health-care providers -- fell in February for the first time since 2013.

ECB President Christine Lagarde on Thursday echoed other central bankers who have recently said there are limits to how much monetary policy can do in the current crisis and called on other policy makers to use fiscal policy, such as tax and government spending measures, to provide support.

"An ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance is now needed in view of the weakened outlook and to safeguard against the further materialization of downside risks," she said.

REVIEW --- Inside a No-Go Zone For Terror --- Mauritania has closed off a wide swath of the Sahara to block the path of Islamist militants.

Mauritania, a vast Muslim country on the edge of West Africa, has adopted a unique strategy to protect itself against an Islamist militant threat that is getting bigger and closer: It has turned more than a quarter of its territory into a no-go zone.

In 2018, Mauritania handed its military control over 108,000 square miles of the Sahara, an area roughly the size of Nevada. Late last month, the Mauritanian army gave The Wall Street Journal unprecedented access to the exclusion zone. Inside, troops have great latitude to arrest or kill anyone suspected of smuggling arms, trafficking drugs or importing Islamist violence. "If you're in the military zone and you don't have permission, you're a suspected terrorist," said army Maj. Sidi Mohamed Hedeid.

It was a move born of a fear that bad things are coming Mauritania's way. The country straddles the Sahara, and in the south, the Sahel, a belt of semiarid land that stretches just below the great desert. A wave of Islamist militancy is overwhelming the countries of the Sahel. Affiliates of al Qaeda and Islamic State killed more than 4,000 people in Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali last year in some 800 attacks.

Deep inside Mauritania's exclusion zone is a military outpost called Lemgheity, or "covered well." The name comes from a water source that travelers braving the Sahara could find there. No village or trading post is nearby. The military stations its troops here because it's a crossroads for nefarious actors coming from Western Sahara, Algeria and Mali.

Just over the Mali border, hundreds of square miles of desert are controlled by fighters from Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin, or JNIM, an umbrella group formed by three al Qaeda allies. Along ancient caravan routes, the lines blur among militants, arms traffickers, camel herders and drug mules. At two wells long used by travelers and herders, al Qaeda fighters now meet and control who gets to drink, the Mauritanians say.

"As long as our neighbors aren't in charge of their territory, we have to take extra steps to protect ours," said Col. Siyed El Asry, deputy commander of the military zone, after inspecting his troops at Lemgheity.

From Mali, a rocky spine called El Hank, or "jaw," extends more than 250 miles southwest across Mauritania; its boulders of dark gray shale have survived 500 million years of erosion around the escarpment. Before GPS navigation, travelers used El Hank as their guidepost through the emptiness of the desert.

The Mauritanian army splits Lemgheity's forces between two adjacent positions atop El Hank. Stone guard towers offer clear fields of fire at likely approaches from Algeria, Mali and Western Sahara. Two lines of rocks mark an airstrip on the otherwise featureless desert floor below, where searing heat distorts the air and creates a mirage of shimmering pools of water. A Mauritania flag, green and red with a yellow star-and-crescent, flutters in front of a tiny stone-and-mud mosque.

In 2005, the outpost was the scene of the bloodiest militant attack in Mauritania in recent years. Some 150 fighters poured over the border from Mali, and at dawn on a June day, seized the high ground on El Hank. The militants surprised Lemgheity's poorly trained, poorly armed 50-man garrison. Seventeen soldiers were killed and were buried in a mass grave downhill from the outpost they died failing to defend. Today, soldiers pray there, holding their hands palms-upward in the traditional display of faith.

With each subsequent attack after 2005, militants ventured further out of the desert and toward towns and cities. Three troops died in a 2007 attack. The following year, militants captured and decapitated 12 soldiers. In 2011, militants believed to be from al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb crossed into Mauritania's south and kidnapped a gendarme.

But the 2011 attack was the last that Mauritania has suffered. In 2009, the military formed an elite Special Intervention Group, which has since received advanced infantry and logistical training from U.S. Marines. The commandos now man seven outposts in the exclusion zone; the military won't disclose the size of the force there. Mobile units spend up to two weeks at a time roaming the hinterlands in desert-tan Toyota Land Cruiser pickup trucks hunting for infiltrators.

It's not a free-fire zone. The army must have reasons to suspect that the pickup trucks they spot crossing the desert are carrying terrorists or smugglers. But officers have wide discretion to arrest or kill suspects without military-zone travel permits. "We scrutinize targets very closely," said Col. Ahmed Salem Noueh, the army's chief of planning. "Sometimes the enemy comes as a trader. Sometimes he comes as a herder."

Commandos also dig wells and provide medicine for desert dwellers along the Mali border, according to the Mauritanians. "The terrorists would like to win the hearts of the population," said Maj. Hedeid. "We want to beat them to it." Mauritanian officials say that they hold jailhouse counseling sessions with captured militants, in which Islamic scholars try to persuade prisoners that violence is against their religion.

In addition to training commandos, the U.S. has donated two Cessna surveillance aircraft that can transmit live footage of enemy positions. Washington applauds Mauritania's anti-militant zeal, while also criticizing the country's human-rights record. The State Department has suspended some military aid because of Mauritania's failure to crack down on human trafficking and hereditary slavery.

In the capital, Nouakchott, rumors persist that the government secretly forged a nonaggression pact with the militants that explains the lack of successful recent attacks, an allegation that the army hotly denies. "There is no agreement with al Qaeda," said Maj. Hedeid. "They're our enemy. We're killing them."

The military believes the no-go zone is the source of its success. In the first two months of this year, troops twice stopped suspects in the desert. In mid-February, one of Mauritania's Western allies intercepted signals and tipped off the Mauritanian army that two suspicious pickups had entered from Western Sahara and were heading east through the zone. Another truck that crossed into Mauritania from Mali was headed west to meet them.

A Mauritanian Super Tucano ground-attack fighter plane, bought from Brazil, scrambled from an air base on the edge of the desert. "We watched them second by second," said Col. Noueh. At the rendezvous point, military photos show, the Super Tucano strafed one of the trucks, which then exploded into orange flame, releasing a rooster's tail of oily black smoke that rose like a beacon into the open sky. Ground troops swarmed the charred remains, seized the other trucks and a pile of machine guns and rifles, and arrested six suspects, several in military-style camouflage pants and one with a leg wound.

The soldiers treated the injured man, tied blindfolds around the prisoners' heads and lined them up next to the contraband for photos. (The army has yet to release information about their nationalities or intentions.)

On the last day of February, with the Saharan sun at its hottest, the troops at the Lemgheity outpost retreated to a stone building, plopped down on cushions on a deep-red floral rug and tore into a shared plate of stewed mutton and soft white bread. They slurped shot glasses of sugary tea.

On a television hooked up to a satellite dish, the men watched as Taliban and U.S. negotiators signed an accord intended to end the 18-year conflict in Afghanistan, which began with al Qaeda's hijacking of four American jetliners on 9/11. It was a surreal moment in the ever-shifting war against Islamist extremists, combatants on one front watching those on another make peace. "I'd like the same thing here in the Sahel," said Maj. Hedeid.

Sanders, Despite Losses, Sticks to Economic Vision --- Candidate knows he's losing the Democratic nomination but aims to push party to left

Bernie Sanders concedes he is losing the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination. But the Vermont senator is still fighting a bigger war: his lifelong crusade to push the party's economic agenda to the left.

The candidate wants to dramatically expand government in order to address "the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality in this country," as he put it Wednesday.

Mr. Sanders's uncompromising adherence to his liberal ideals has been both his strength and weakness in this campaign. It energizes his core supporters, who favor his purity over more flexible rivals. But it has also turned off Democrats who dislike his ideas or worry they are unrealistic, and that his stubbornness would keep him from the give-and-take necessary to accomplish change in Washington. As Mr. Sanders himself has acknowledged, many also worry that his far-left position could make it hard to draw enough voters to beat President Trump in a general election. The escalating coronavirus crisis might also make Americans more risk-averse in choosing a leader.

Mr. Sanders argues that voters agree with his platform, even if they are skeptical of his candidacy. "Poll after poll . . . shows that a strong majority of the American people support our progressive agenda," he said, in explaining why he would continue his campaign against front-runner Joe Biden, despite two straight weeks of primary losses and calls for him to drop out and unify the party against Mr. Trump.

He vowed to use Sunday's debate, the first solely between the two candidates, to press his rival for detailed plans for expanding health care, reducing childhood poverty and curbing the political power of billionaires. The candidates face primaries on Tuesday in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio.

Mr. Sanders's bid to remake Democratic economic thinking remains one of the most intense conflicts in this election cycle, pitting him against affluent party donors and policy makers who share many of his general goals, but prefer a less government-oriented, or more tempered approach.

Surveys indicate a party electorate torn. A February Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed 53% of Democratic voters preferred a candidate pushing Sanders-like "larger scale policies that might cost more" and "bring major change," versus 41% favoring a Biden-like candidate "who proposes smaller scale policies that . . . will bring less change."

But the same poll found Democrats, by 53% to 42%, favored a candidate "with the best chance to defeat Donald Trump" over one "closest to your views" -- and they have increasingly concluded Mr. Biden has the best chance.

When Mr. Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, appeared ascendant last month in the nominating contest, his sweeping platform of national health care, universal free college and a Green New Deal drew blistering criticism from Democratic stalwarts.

Harvard economist Lawrence Summers, a top adviser to both Presidents Clinton and Obama, predicted "major adverse consequences" for workers, markets and business investment should Mr. Sanders prevail. Former Obama White House chief economist Jason Furman, also now at Harvard, said the Sanders program would lead to "too many individuals too constrained from choices" and "a weaker economy." The Progressive Policy Institute, a Washington center-left think tank, branded the platform "fiscal fantasy."

None of that moved Mr. Sanders to soften his policies. Instead, Mr. Sanders and his aides have blasted the criticism and the critics as tainted and out of touch. They blame moderate Democratic economists and think tanks, as much as Republicans, for long-term wage stagnation and other economic worries still haunting millions of Americans.

"We need to think outside the box," said Warren Gunnels, Mr. Sanders's policy adviser. "Over the past 45 years we've seen a massive increase in income and wealth inequality while the working class continues to struggle. It's too late for establishment economics."

Mr. Sanders is more likely to discuss fostering a "moral economy" than strategies to boost gross domestic product, business investment or corporate profits. With his "economic bill of rights," he wants Washington to guarantee all Americans a job, health insurance, college and housing.

Many Democratic economists "would argue those are fine aspirations, but in order to achieve them, you'd have to intervene in markets beyond levels they're comfortable with," said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the chief economist in the Obama administration for then-Vice President Biden.

Mr. Sanders proposes sharply higher taxes, government spending and regulation. He would boost the size of the federal government's share of GDP to a level exceeded only during World War II.

While many Democrats over the past few decades have tried to balance government intervention with market forces, Mr. Sanders has less trust in markets to improve lives. On Thursday, he said his big-government vision of a national health-care plan and price controls on drug companies would put the country on stronger footing to address crises such as the coronavirus pandemic.

At times, he has dismissed cost concerns outright. Asked at a Feb. 18 CNN Las Vegas town hall about the price and feasibility of his plan to phase out fossil fuels, he replied: "You tell me how much is too much if we're talking about saving this planet."

Mr. Sanders wants to smash the conventional wisdom that he says has constrained thinking in Washington since Ronald Reagan -- a consensus that treats higher taxes and new government programs with suspicion -- and reopen discussion of liberal ideas that haven't been seriously considered since the 1970s.

The candidate already claims victory on that front, recounting how proposals from his failed 2016 bid, dismissed at the time as too far left, have since been embraced by Democratic party leaders.

One fight with Hillary Clinton, who won the 2016 Democratic nomination, was over his push to double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. The Democratic-led House last year passed a bill seeking to make that law, while all his 2020 rival candidates endorsed the goal. Mr. Sanders's 2016 proposal for a Wall Street tax on certain financial transactions was also embraced by much of the 2020 field. Mr. Biden's current positions on many issues, such as expanding Social Security and Medicare, have moved him closer to Mr. Sanders than the longtime Delaware politician has been for much of his career.

"I have been called radical and extreme," Mr. Sanders said in Iowa last year. "Over the last four years . . . a whole lot of other people have become radical and extreme."

Some mainstream center-left economists praise Mr. Sanders's bid to shake up the Washington consensus on restricting spending. "All upper-income democracies in the world have much more generous welfare states than the U.S. and do fine," said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank that has long advised both Republican and Democratic administrations. "We've gone so far off the rails in terms of underinvestment in the public sphere that even a massive shift would only get us part way to where we should be."

The Sanders campaign has been the only major one in this election cycle to avoid even talking to top advisers of previous Democratic presidents. Economists who weren't part of the Clinton or Obama administrations have been close to the Sanders campaign. One is Stephanie Kelton, a professor at Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, N.Y., who served as an aide to Mr. Sanders on the Senate Budget Committee. She is the leading proponent of "modern monetary theory," which argues that governments shouldn't fret over debt and deficits.

Another is Darrick Hamilton of Ohio State University, whose work focuses on what he calls "economic justice." He aims to narrow the wealth gap between black and white households and has been a proponent of the federal job guarantee idea that Mr. Sanders has endorsed.

Mr. Sanders's wealth tax was written with the help of two French economists at the University of California, Berkeley, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman.

The Progressive Policy Institute estimates that Mr. Sanders is proposing adding just over $50 trillion in spending over 10 years, nearly doubling the federal government's current outlays. The new funds would mainly be used to expand the social safety net and infrastructure spending.

That is more than eight times the spending proposed by Mr. Biden, according to PPI.

Mr. Sanders would boost taxes by more than $20 trillion over 10 years, according to PPI, by increases in income, payroll and corporate taxes, as well as the new wealth tax.

That is six times the hikes laid out by Mr. Biden.

Most mainstream economists say spending and taxes on that scale would so distort the economy and private-sector activity that it would undermine growth. They warn that significantly higher tax rates could damp incentives for businesses and individuals to invest, while bigger payouts to households could curb incentives to work. They add that attempts by regulators to override market outcomes can impose costly inefficiencies in affected industries.

Mr. Gunnels, the Sanders aide, dismissed concerns about boosting the size of government. "If we were a poor country . . . these would be legitimate questions," he said. "We're not living in a Third World country. It's not too much to ask that everybody in this country has a decent standard of living."

Sanders allies said his platform has successful parallels: Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1930s New Deal, which created Social Security and a raft of new government programs and regulations; and Lyndon B. Johnson's 1960s Great Society, which created Medicare and new antipoverty initiatives.

Harvard's Mr. Summers said the scale of Mr. Sanders's proposals would far exceed anything FDR or LBJ enacted, or even what South Dakota Democratic Sen. George McGovern proposed during his 1972 landslide loss to Richard Nixon, a defeat that helped usher in the party's retreat from liberalism.

If Mr. Sanders enacted his full program, government as a share of GDP would jump from the 2017 level of about 38%, one of the lowest levels in the developed world, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, to more than 50%. That is well above any peacetime level in U.S. history, but in line with European countries such as France and Denmark.

He also envisions a raft of new government regulations, from national rent control to new rules for CEO pay to an outright ban on fracking.

While some Democratic economists prefer to address climate change with market incentives, such as a carbon tax, Mr. Sanders would rely more on direct government orders. To protect energy workers who might lose their jobs, he promises five years of government-guaranteed salary, plus housing assistance, pension support and retirement subsidies for those who decide not to continue working.

That "would be an utter nightmare to enforce," said Dean Baker, an economist at the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, saying it would be difficult to flesh out the criteria for who exactly would qualify.

Mr. Sanders would aim to shrink the role of the financial sector in the economy by, among other things, breaking up the largest banks, and reimposing Depression-era limits on banking activity.

He would make it harder for employers to fire workers, unionized or not, and would require big companies to give workers shares of company stock and the right to choose nearly half the seats on corporate boards. His goal is to recalibrate the balance of power between corporations and unions, who have seen their clout erode steadily over the past 40 years.

"In Bernie Sanders's world, the market doesn't come from a state of nature, it comes out of an allocation of power," said Robert Reich, a Berkeley public policy professor, who served as President Clinton's labor secretary and has periodically defended Mr. Sanders against attacks from other academics. "The standard economic view is that the market is filled with potential win-win opportunities, but when you're talking about power, it's more complicated. Some people gain it and others lose it."

Politics: Court to Reconsider Subpoena Decision

WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court announced it will reconsider whether former White House counsel Don McGahn must testify in a congressional investigation of President Trump, withdrawing a February ruling that declined to enforce a subpoena issued by a House committee.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said it would hear the case again, this time with more judges participating. Oral arguments will take place April 28.

The court issued an order saying it was vacating a Feb. 28 ruling by a divided three-judge panel that said courts shouldn't get in the middle of disputes between branches of government like the McGahn subpoena battle between Congress and the White House.

The Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee issued the subpoena last year as it was investigating possible misconduct by Mr. Trump, including whether he obstructed special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing. The White House instructed Mr. McGahn not to appear.

A central question in the case is whether the House has legal standing to ask a court to force White House compliance. The White House separately has argued that close presidential advisers, like Mr. McGahn, enjoy absolute immunity from appearing before Congress. The court's February ruling never addressed that issue because it said the case didn't belong in court.

That ruling said Congress had other tools to use against the Trump administration, such as holding officials in contempt.

The Judiciary Committee asked the D.C. Circuit to reconsider the case, which prompted Friday's court order.

U.S. News: FAA Probes In-Flight Crack on Southwest Jet

U.S. air-safety officials are investigating potential structural problems affecting hundreds of Boeing 737 jets following an in-flight incident that left a 12-inch rupture in the aluminum skin of a Southwest Airlines plane.

Nobody was hurt on Monday night's flight, en route from Las Vegas to Boise, Idaho, as the damaged aircraft descended to a safe altitude and the pilots landed at their destination, according to the carrier and the Federal Aviation Administration. The plane's cabin gradually lost pressure but it stabilized after pilots descended to a lower altitude, and oxygen masks never deployed.

The unusual event has prompted the agency to analyze whether more-frequent inspections should be ordered to check the integrity of the same part of the fuselage on similar 737 models.

The FAA analysis doesn't affect Boeing's 737 MAX models, which are newer and currently grounded around the globe.

Pilots on Southwest Flight 1685 descended to 22,000 feet from 39,000 feet and continued safely to their destination.

"The aircraft was able to maintain a safe cabin pressure," according to an FAA statement, adding that the agency is investigating.

A spokeswoman for Southwest said the plane was taken out of service and is being repaired. "We consistently review our maintenance programs based on new information and continually seek opportunities to improve our robust safety practices," she said.

Southwest has told the FAA that previously mandated maintenance checks found external cracks on two other 737s in the same location as with the plane involved in Monday's incident, according to people familiar with the details. But those cracks -- on top of the plane behind the cockpit -- didn't result in the kind of cabin decompression that occurred on the flight this week, according to information the carrier has provided to FAA inspectors.

Current FAA safety rules require inspections after every 1,500 flights to look for cracks on the exterior of that portion of the fuselage. The jet that landed safely in Boise was inspected roughly 500 flights before Monday's incident, according to a person familiar with the details.

Such maintenance checks for structural problems are routine safety initiatives across all airliner models.

The most serious result of cracks in an aircraft's body is a rapid decompression of the cabin. Such a problem can create a hole in the fuselage, through which, in extreme cases, passengers can even be sucked out in flight.

The FAA and Boeing have been devising enhanced maintenance procedures for the same section of what is called the crown of 737 jets since 2008. The original safety directive was replaced by revised inspection requirements in 2016 and again in 2017.

It is too early to know whether the FAA will require more-frequent inspections, according to another person familiar with the details. Before any decision, FAA experts are expected to review the service and maintenance history -- as well as the structural integrity of certain modifications -- affecting Southwest and other U.S. operators of the widely used 737 models.

In 2016, the FAA's maintenance order called on airlines to look for missing or loose fasteners and laid out other measures intended to prevent cracks from spreading.

The 2017 safety directive said Boeing determined that the skin of certain 737 models is subject to widespread metal-fatigue damage. If the weakness isn't detected and corrected, according to the FAA, it could "result in reduced structural integrity of the airplane."

REVIEW --- When Epidemics Wreaked Havoc In America --- Deadly infectious diseases were once common in the U.S., until science conquered them. In today's crisis, it's worth recalling those celebrated victories.

It may have been the high point of America's fragile love affair with medical science. "SALK'S VACCINE WORKS," screamed the nation's headlines on April 12, 1955. "POLIO IS CONQUERED." An insidious childhood disease that came like clockwork each summer during the middle years of the 20th century, killing thousands and crippling many more, would be all but eradicated in the U.S. within a single generation.

Rarely, if ever, had a scientist received the instant adulation that awaited Jonas Salk. Tributes piled up, including the Congressional Gold Medal, awarded previously to the likes of Thomas Edison, Charles Lindbergh and General George C. Marshall. The Eisenhower White House circulated a memo suggesting a Rose Garden ceremony for maximum political gain: "We've [got to] show that the president is just as interested as [Franklin D. Roosevelt] in polio . . . to take away the perennial Democratic thunder." Yet those who witnessed the event were touched by its simple humanity. "No bands played and no flags waved," wrote a reporter who had followed Eisenhower for years. "But nothing could have been more impressive than this grandfather standing there and telling Dr. Salk in a voice trembling with emotion, 'I have no words to thank you. I am very, very happy.'"

New vaccines soon followed -- for measles, mumps and rubella. Coupled with earlier laboratory miracles, including the introduction of antibiotics like penicillin and streptomycin, Americans saw a huge jump in their life expectancy, driven by the precipitous decline of infectious diseases. The war against germs, it appeared, had become a rout.

The impact of disease on American history is a remarkably understudied subject. Textbooks give it short shrift in comparison to political, military, diplomatic and economic affairs, but the catalog of key episodes is long. We must not forget that the European conquest and settlement of the Americas were largely dependent on the deadly diseases the settlers brought; or that the grand plan of the Continental Congress to conquer Quebec in 1775 was halted, in large part, by a fearful smallpox outbreak among the troops; or that more American soldiers died from influenza during World War I than from battle wounds, in a pandemic that killed upward of 50 million people world-wide.

It takes the fear of a pandemic, as we are experiencing today with Covid-19, to remind us that infectious diseases were once so common, so deadly, that Americans had little choice but to accept the toll they exacted with stoicism and dread. Death by epidemic remained a natural, if depressing, part of American life until just a few generations ago.

Take yellow fever, for example. A virus transmitted by the bite of the female Aedes aegypti mosquito, with a mortality rate sometimes approaching 50%, it came to the Americas on slave ships from Africa. As trade routes expanded, it reached the port cities of North America, striking Philadelphia, the young nation's capital, in 1793, where it killed at least 10% of the population and caused the federal government to temporarily disband. Most of Congress fled the city, as did President George Washington and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, an ardent defender of rural values, who found odd comfort amid the carnage. "The yellow fever will discourage the growth of cities in our nation," he wrote a friend, "& I view great cities as pestilential to the morals, the health and the liberties of man."

Americans were stumped by its spread. The fact that a vector as tiny as a mosquito could cause a catastrophe of this magnitude was simply beyond anyone's comprehension. Physicians blamed the disease on miasmas -- the noxious vapors arising from corpses, rotting food, and swamp and sewer gases -- that were believed to form dangerous airborne clouds. The diaries these doctors left behind show how completely they missed the signals that now seem so obvious today. All complained about mosquitoes swarming and biting, relentless and inescapable. One remarked that he'd never seen as many people "covered with blisters from their venomous operations." Yet it would be another full century before Dr. Walter Reed confirmed the transmission of the disease by mosquito, which led, in turn, to the draining of swamps, the screening of windows, the development of insecticides and eventually a vaccine.

New York City also saw its share of epidemics. Hardly a decade went by in the 1700s without a serious smallpox eruption. One outbreak in 1731 killed more than 500 of the city's 10,000 residents, roughly three times the percentage of New Yorkers who would die in the influenza pandemic of 1918.

As the city grew, quickly becoming America's largest, observers described a pulsing new energy -- "a sea of masts" in the harbor, "streets jammed with carts and wheel barrows, buildings "rising everywhere." But that harbor became something ominous as well: a magnet for the world's microbes and maladies. Diseases like scarlet fever, measles, typhus and "throat distemper" (diphtheria) came in giant waves. Yet for sheer terror, nothing quite matched cholera, which repeatedly brought New York to a stop.

A bacterial disease, spread through food and water contaminated by the excrement of infected victims, cholera causes the body to expel enormous quantities of liquids through vomiting and explosive diarrhea. There is no incubation period. The victim can be fine in the morning and dead by nightfall.

Having not a clue as to its cause, authorities blamed it on miasmas and slum-dwelling immigrants -- in this case, the Irish. "As a class of people," wrote one New York physician, "they are exceedingly dirty, exhausted by drunkenness, and crowded together in the worst portions of the city." Certainly his last charge was true. Fleeing the rural starvation of Counties Cork, Kerry and Sligo for the slums of New York City, the Irish lived in ghastly squalor, using whatever water was at hand. In Five Points, their primary neighborhood, that meant a series of shallow wells polluted by fecal waste from backyard privies.

The result was predictable. The foreign-born accounted for 71% of the deaths from the 1832 cholera epidemic, at a time when immigrants were barely 10% of New York City's population. Sympathy was in short supply. Indeed, the response from many quarters was even harsher than Jefferson's view of Philadelphia. "Those sickened must be cured or die off," wrote an unforgiving New York official, "& being chiefly of the very scum of the city, the quicker their dispatch, the sooner the malady will cease."

How did other New Yorkers approach cholera? In medieval fashion: They quarantined the victims and then humbled themselves before God. Sermons, prayers and fasting were highly recommended; if all else failed, run like hell. One observer compared the exodus of "well-filled stage coaches" during the summer of 1832 to the stampede from Pompeii "when the red lava flowed." Social distancing favored the rich. Those with means weren't inclined to stick around.

Two decades later, a brilliant British physician named John Snow would introduce the modern field of epidemiology by mapping cholera deaths surrounding a polluted well in central London. He showed that the disease was transmitted not by noxious fumes in the atmosphere but rather by something in the drinking water, which he couldn't actually see. His so-called Ghost Map convinced local authorities to remove the well's pump handle -- and the epidemic ceased. In 1884, German researcher Robert Koch identified that mysterious agent, Vibrio cholerae, under a microscope, a discovery that helped to demolish the miasma theory for good.

Some deadly diseases came and went; others, such as tuberculosis, typhoid fever and smallpox, lingered for centuries, despite medical breakthroughs that included Edward Jenner's miraculous smallpox vaccine. In comparison to Europe, where bacterial research had begun in earnest by the mid-19th century, American medicine proved somewhat slow to give up old habits and ideas, from bleeding and purging the patient to the acceptance of germ theory, which stipulated that invisible organisms caused specific diseases and that antiseptic methods might be employed to halt their spread. In 1870, one child in five born in New York City would not live to see his first birthday, and 25% of those who did reach adulthood would die before the age of 30.

The unfettered optimism surrounding the era of Salk and miracle drugs was understandable, if somewhat premature. The U.S. had recently survived a depression and won a two-front global war. The atomic age had dawned. Science and technology were riding high. Nothing now seemed beyond the reach of the laboratory to heal or to prevent. Some spoke openly of a future without infectious disease. "Will such a world exist?" asked one prominent scientist. "We believe so."

It hasn't turned out that way. AIDS, SARS, MERS, Zika, Ebola, swine flu, superbugs -- all bear witness to the arrogance of that remark. And yet it's equally true that until a month or two ago, Americans went about their business without the slightest concern that an epidemic on the scale of smallpox or cholera or yellow fever might randomly strike them down.

There's a reason we're emotionally unprepared for what may lie ahead: We simply haven't experienced the extreme cycles of infectious disease that previous generations were forced to endure. We're in frightening new territory, wondering if there is enough protective equipment for medical personnel and first responders, if there are enough test kits and ventilators for possible victims, if an effective vaccine is really a year or so away.

Many wonder as well about the new dangers unleashed by globalization. Germs travel, and the consequences can be severe. But that's the way it's been for centuries, at an admittedly slower pace. Yellow fever and malaria came to North America from Africa; cholera and typhus rode the steamers and "coffin ships" that discharged immigrant cargo at our shores. History assures us that Covid-19 will be conquered by science and that another virus, originating in a bat cave, a pig farm or an open-air poultry market somewhere in the world, will rise up to take its place. That's the nature of the beast.

In times like this, when anxiety turns so easily to fear, it sometimes helps to focus upon an optimistic vision of the future. For me, it's the image of a war hero turned president tearfully thanking a selfless researcher for helping to save the children of the world.

Dancing Under the Red Star

By Karl Tobien (2006)

1. Carl Werner had no idea of the life that lay ahead when he left Detroit with his wife and young daughter for Gorky, U.S.S.R., where, as one of 450 Ford employees sent by Henry Ford to the Soviet Union between 1930 and 1932, he was to operate a new manufacturing facility. The life ahead would entail being arrested by the secret police and, shortly after, being killed during Stalin's purge of the late 1930s. Millions were executed. Werner's daughter, Margaret, 17 at the time, saw her father's expression as he was taken away. In "Dancing Under the Red Star," a biography written by her son: "I saw in his face the end -- the end of his innocently blind optimism and the end of his hopes for our life in this country that was not ours." Margaret herself was then arrested and sentenced to 10 years in Stalin's gulag, where she endured starvation, fear and hard labor. But she also found friendship and love there -- this, particularly after Stalin's death in 1953. "It felt as if the master of the house had suddenly died, and all of his grateful servants were beginning to celebrate their new lives." Her story is a testament to the power of a defiant optimism. She was the only American woman to survive the gulag and return home.

Journey Into the Whirlwind

By Eugenia Ginzburg (1967)

2. "I don't want to sound pretentious," wrote Eugenia Ginzburg, a convinced communist who helped establish the Soviet regime, "but I must say in all honesty that, had I been ordered to die for the Party . . . I would have obeyed without the slightest hesitation." But then, in 1937, Ginzburg was arrested on charges that she was a member of a (nonexistent) Trotskyite movement. She spent the first period of her 18-year imprisonment "in tormented conflict between reason and the kind of foreboding which Lermontov called 'prophetic anguish.'" She would be transformed by her realization of the guilt she bore for her role in nurturing so monstrous a creation as the Soviet regime, and would write that "eighteen years of hell on earth are not enough for a fault like mine."

My Autobiography

By Evgeniia Isaakovna Iaroslavskaia-Markon (2001)

3. Evgeniia Isaakovna Iaroslavskaia-Markon, a philosopher and journalist, had embraced the revolution at the age of 13. As edited and translated by Veronica Shapovalov in "Remembering the Darkness: Women in Soviet Prisons," Iaroslavskaia-Markon confesses that she "fell in love -- completely and with impassioned sincerity -- with the idea of revolution." She found Alexander, the man of her life, when she was 20, and in the same year suffered an accident that made it necessary to amputate both her feet. To which event her response is, "What is the loss of one's feet compared to such a great love as ours?" When Alexander was arrested after a tour of Western European universities, Iaroslavskaia-Markon's protest against the Soviet state's arbitrariness was immediate, notwithstanding her devotion to the cause of revolution. If the state was criminal, she would be too. She surrounded herself with "petty criminals": pickpockets, shoplifters, robbers and punks whose activities she shared until she was caught, taken to jail, sent to a labor camp and sentenced to death. Ever determined to puncture official lies, she wrote in her autobiography, before she was executed in 1931, at the age of 29: "No state in the world can remain revolutionary, by the very definition of a state."

Between Shades of Gray

By Ruta Sepetys (2011)

4. "They took me in my nightgown." Thus begins Ruta Sepetys's story of her mother, Lina, age 15 in 1941, when the Soviet secret police barged into her home in Lithuania and arrested her along with her younger brother and her mother. The account follows a familiar pattern: prison, a long journey to Siberia, hard labor, starvation, extreme cold. The family is then taken to the north, to chop wood. The sign they see upon their arrival reads "Trofimovsk." They are at the top of the Arctic Circle. When Lina's mother asks for a stove for the jurta -- the common barracks the prisoners built out of mud -- the guard replies: "You'd like a stove? What else? A hot bath? A glass of cognac? Shut up and get to work." Lina's salvation was artwork. "After everyone was asleep, I drew by moonlight." The worst thing was the darkness. "In the polar region, the sun falls below the horizon for 180 days. Darkness for nearly half a year." The prisoners were convinced that if they endured the first long winter without the sun, they'd survive. On a morning six months after they arrived, Lina left the jurta to chop wood. "I began my walk through the snow," she recalls. "That's when I saw it. A tiny sliver of gold appeared between the shades of gray on the horizon. I stared at the amber band of sunlight, smiling. The sun had returned."

Unedited Life

By Valentina Grigorievna Ievleva-Pavlenko (2001)

5. Arrested after the end of World War II on charges of spying for the West, Valentina Grigorievna Ievleva-Pavlenko was sentenced to a six-year term in the gulag. She would go on to labor in Russia's far north and in Eastern Siberia. A woman who regularly told herself she was not a slave and would not accept being one, she escaped one night to look for her lover, Boris, also a prisoner. Her account, also included in the anthology "Remembering the Darkness," attests to the joy she took from this exercise of her will, though in the end she was caught and dragged to the guards' barracks. There, "the whole platoon began to beat me." Through the hellishness of the gulag she was sustained, her story suggests, largely by love affairs with men she met there, prisoners like herself, and also by her close friendships with women prisoners.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Central Banks Struggle to Confront Threats to Markets

The world's major central banks are straining to tamp down threats to financial markets and the global economy created by the coronavirus pandemic, held back by limited tools and a new kind of risk from outside the financial system they are set up to manage.

Stocks rallied Friday, in part on signs of progress in Congress toward passing measures to support the economy. However, beneath the surface, Wall Street was under growing pressure as financial firms rushed out of complex bond-market trades that pushed up long-term U.S. Treasury borrowing rates, which typically go down in a crisis.

In response, the Federal Reserve accelerated a program announced just a day earlier to pump funds into the financial system and stabilize the rise in long-term interest rates and other credit costs.

The Bank of Canada cut its main policy rate by a half-percentage point Friday, while the European Central Bank sought to reassure investors and governments about its support a day after ECB President Christine Lagarde sent unnerving signals of a limited response from Frankfurt. China's central bank pumped roughly $80 billion into commercial banks as part of continuing efforts to ensure the stability of its financial system. Australia's central bank also added funds to its banking system.

"There is every reason to be concerned that what we're seeing on the ground with this virus and in this market, the response [of global central banks] might not be big enough," said Bruce Kasman, head of economic research at J.P. Morgan.

The world's central banks are trying to manage several shocks simultaneously. The most pressing problem Friday was reducing market disruptions tied to economic uncertainty.

Market mayhem turned from falling stock prices to bond volatility not seen since the financial crisis over a decade ago.

The Fed and other central banks are responding by making sure banks are flush with funds to back loans, credit lines and trading so the economy's problems aren't compounded by a malfunctioning financial system. The central bank said Friday it would pump $37 billion into the system by purchasing Treasury securities from banks.

The next problem will be finding ways to stimulate economic growth as consumer and business activity slows in many nations. While central banks have ample resources to pump money into the financial system, they are constrained in how much they can stimulate the broader economy because interest rates are already very low.

U.S. News: Florida Legislature Passes A Weakened E-Verify Bill

MIAMI -- Florida lawmakers passed a bill late Thursday that requires some employers to use the federal E-Verify system to check the immigration status of new hires, but doesn't include the strict enforcement provisions for which conservatives had advocated.

The measure comes in a presidential election year in which President Trump is expected to campaign in part on his aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration. Florida, which has a large immigrant population, but also a Republican base animated by opposition to illegal immigration, will likely be a key battleground.

The bill passed the Florida Senate 23-17, after clearing the state House 73-45 a day earlier. It is now headed to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, an ally of Mr. Trump who is expected to sign it.

The bill would make Florida the 21st state to require use of the federal E-Verify program, an electronic government database that checks whether new hires are eligible to work in the U.S., according to LawLogix, a software company that specializes in immigration compliance.

While employers praised lawmakers for removing the bill's most stringent enforcement provisions, some still criticized the state for passing any version of an E-Verify bill. They argued immigration legislation should be handled by Congress, not by individual states that thereby create an inconsistent patchwork for companies.

Paul DiMare, president of DiMare Fresh, a large tomato grower in Florida, said he already struggles to fill jobs, 30% to 40% of which are vacant at his company. An E-Verify measure will make it even harder by scaring away workers, he added. "As soon as you put in E-Verify, they will move to another state," he said. "It's a destruction of our businesses."

E-Verify legislation has failed repeatedly in Florida in recent years. It has faced strong opposition from business and agricultural groups that rely on immigrant labor and from lawmakers in districts with large immigrant populations.

This year, lawmakers reached a compromise that hands Mr. DeSantis a partial victory, but appeases the concerns of some opponents.

Though the GOP governor had pushed for a bill that would require all employers to use E-Verify, lawmakers weakened it -- in part to appease House members, including Republican Speaker Jose Oliva, uncomfortable with some enforcement provisions. The version passed by lawmakers would mandate E-Verify only for public employers and companies that contract with them.

Private employers would have a choice either to use E-Verify or rely on I-9 employment authorization forms already required for businesses. Advocates of stronger immigration enforcement said the bill didn't go far enough.

"A better way to start with state-based E-Verify legislation is to start with requiring state agencies and contractors or certain industries to use it and build on that," said Jessica M. Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, a group arguing for lower levels of immigration. "But you can't give employers the choice."

The current version stripped out controversial aspects in an earlier iteration. They included a provision allowing the state's economic-development office to conduct random audits of employment files of firms that don't use E-Verify. Business groups assailed those parts of the bill as empowering a state agency to become an arm of federal immigration authorities. Under the current bill, private employers face just an additional paperwork rule: To retain for at least three years the documentation workers provide as part of the I-9 verification process.

"They didn't get everything they wanted, but they were still able to pass legislation that undermines business and scapegoats immigrants," said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, which works with businesses that support liberalized immigration legislation.

World News: Israeli Leaders to Weigh Unity Government

TEL AVIV -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and rival Benny Gantz agreed to discuss forming a unity government, saying the threat from the new coronavirus made it necessary to end the yearlong political stalemate.

The talks offer a potential lifeline for Mr. Netanyahu, who is trying to remain in power as he goes on trial for corruption charges next week. Mr. Gantz's Blue and White party previously objected to any unity government that allowed Mr. Netanyahu to remain prime minister while under indictment, while Mr. Netanyahu's Likud party insisted he serve first in any rotation agreement.

"It's a Hail Mary pass," said Shalom Lipner, who worked for several Israeli prime ministers including Mr. Netanyahu and is now with the Atlantic Council think tank. "There's public desperation over both the coronavirus and the political situation."

The two leaders spoke by phone Thursday evening, during which Mr. Gantz said the parties' negotiators should meet to urgently discuss forming an emergency government, according to his spokeswoman.

Three elections in just under one year have proved inconclusive. Previous talks on a unity government in September broke down following disagreements on who would first serve as prime minister.

The epidemic offers impetus for Messrs. Netanyahu and Gantz to set aside animosity and end interim rule. Israel has already taken extraordinary measures to address the outbreak, including requiring all foreign arrivals to self-quarantine.

The talks follow two weeks of wrangling by Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz to find paths to ruling without the backing of the other. The Likud party came out of elections on March 2 as the largest party with 36 seats, with Mr. Gantz's party the second biggest with 33, but neither has enough support for the 61 seats needed to form a governing coalition.

Obstacles remain, with both politicians calling for an emergency unity government but neither saying which parties would be part of the coalition.

Mr. Gantz said Thursday that Blue and White "would be willing to discuss establishing a national emergency government that would include representation of all parts of the house," which many took to mean including the Joint List group of Arab parties. The two politicians disagreed about what role the Joint List would play in such a government, Mr. Netanyahu's office said Friday.

World News: Baghdad Angered by U.S. Strikes On Militia Group

WASHINGTON -- Iraqi officials reacted angrily to American airstrikes against an Iran-backed group on Iraqi soil, contributing to increased U.S.-Iraqi tensions as the two countries attempt to jointly defeat terrorist groups operating there.

The Pentagon said Thursday it had carried out a series of strikes against weapons facilities belonging to Kataib Hezbollah, or KH, an Iran-backed, Shiite militia group based in Iraq that repeatedly has staged rocket attacks against American forces there, U.S. military officials said.

The U.S. airstrikes, which occurred early Friday in Baghdad, were in response to an attack by KH that killed three coalition members, including two Americans, and injured 14 more. The U.S., operating alone, used manned aircraft to target five weapons-storage sites across central Iraq, officials said. The Iraqi military said six individuals, none of whom were members of KH, had been killed in the strikes.

President Barham Salih denounced the American airstrikes and said they further undermined the state's authority, making it harder for Iraq to deal with multiple crises, including a coronavirus outbreak, a political vacuum and a looming economic crunch.

Mr. Salih warned that Iraq risked sliding into chaos and said there already were signs that Islamic State, which was largely defeated, was reconstituting itself. Iraq's foreign minister summoned the American and British ambassadors following the strikes and anti-U.S. politicians renewed their calls for the expulsion of foreign forces.

Earlier this year, pro-Iranian members of the Iraqi parliament spearheaded a vote to eject all of the approximately 5,000 American forces from Iraq following the U.S. airstrike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the top Iranian general, in Iraq Jan. 3. The U.S. has tried to resolve the dispute with the Iraqi government while maintaining U.S. force levels there to prevent Islamic State from staging attacks in the country.

Gen. Frank McKenzie, the head of U.S. Central Command, which oversees operations in the Middle East, said that Friday's strikes were defensive in nature and that the weapons storage-facilities destroyed were legitimate targets.

"We assessed that each location stored weapons that would enable lethal operations against U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq," Gen. McKenzie told reporters at the Pentagon Friday. "We also assessed that the destruction of these sites will degrade Kataib Hezbollah's ability to conduct future strikes."

Gen. McKenzie said the U.S. consulted with the Iraqi government after the strikes on the weapons facilities.

He also said a Patriot missile system, which can defend against a ballistic missile strike like the one launched by Iran after the killing of Gen. Soleimani, would soon be installed and operable within Iraq.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: States Vary on Virus Approach

The Newport City Council narrowly voted Tuesday to allow its 64th annual St. Patrick's Day parade to march on Saturday, siding with community members who warned that canceling would signal that the coastal Rhode Island tourist town is closed for business.

"Don't choke," Jack Milburn, a retired firefighter, urged Newport council members from the podium.

Some 24 hours later, the same City Council voted unanimously to nix the parade after Gov. Gina Raimondo asked people not to attend events for more than 250 people for the next two weeks.

With limited information and facing extreme time pressure, county-level officials, mayors and governors from New Jersey to Washington state issued a patchwork of edicts and directions this week. They moved to try to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus, in some cases making hard decisions to overturn beloved traditions and disappoint constituents. With the gravity of the situation setting in, most public officials have chosen to cancel events or limit crowds, but U.S. states and municipalities thus far are taking divergent approaches to the new virus.

"We understand that people have to live their lives, and business has to continue, however we have only one chance to contain this," Ms. Raimondo said, warning there would need to be "radical change" in behaviors for a period of time.

The government's message helped Mr. Milburn come around to the idea that Newport's parade should be canceled, he said.

Confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in the U.S. have topped 1,700, including 40 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Roughly 80% of cases tend to be mild or moderate. But those who are older or have underlying health conditions are at a higher risk.

In California's Santa Clara County, which has been particularly hard-hit, county health officials initially banned events with 1,000 people or more before revising that number to 100 on Friday, while Riverside County, which has reported fewer than 10 local cases, ordered the Coachella music festival and all events with 250 people or more canceled or postponed.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo banned most gatherings of more than 500 people, a move that darkened Broadway shows. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee halted events of 250 people or more in three counties. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine squashed many get-togethers topping 100 people.

The disparate responses stem from the fact that most public-health powers rest with states, said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University.

"Unlike Italy or China, the United States Constitution is a federalist constitution, and it gives virtually all public health powers to the states," he said.

That philosophy has long prevailed in states like California, which has 58 counties and more than five dozen local health departments.

"What we are doing is a bottom-up process not a top-down process. I think the local health officials should make those determinations," Gov. Gavin Newsom said this week.

That may be easier said than done.

In a statement the same day, San Mateo County public health officer Scott Morrow said he had been asked to make "significant policy decisions" with very little information. Mr. Morrow had recommended canceling all nonessential gatherings but acknowledged he could offer no standard definition of that term. "Use your best judgment," he said.

With nearly 30 years of experience in public health, Mr. Morrow said, "If I am filled with uncertainty, I can only imagine how the general public must be feeling."

New guidance issued by Mr. Newsom in California Wednesday urged canceling or postponing large events such as concerts, conferences and sporting events of 250 people, and even smaller ones if social distance couldn't be maintained.

"These are tricky decisions," said Jon Mitchell, mayor of New Bedford, Mass., 60 miles south of Boston.

Mr. Mitchell earlier this week called off the New Bedford Half Marathon, which was set for Sunday. Thousands of runners penned in at the start, sweating and coughing and spitting, "makes for a 3,000-person petri dish," he said in an interview Thursday. "I woke up in the morning and said, 'No way can we do this race.'"

Local officials face a fundamental problem, he said: A lack of information because so few people have been tested relative to populations. That means cities can't easily isolate infected people, leaving two main steps of recourse: good hygiene and keeping people away from one another.

Diverse responses aren't problematic in themselves, said Yaneer Bar-Yam, a scientist at the New England Complex Systems Institute, a research institution that has studied community response to pandemics.

The ability to be nimble and implement different responses "frees up the system to change," he said.

A greater risk is "people really don't understand that there are these superspreader events," he said. A number of coronavirus outbreaks around the world had superspreader events, from a food market in China to a religious service in South Korea, he said.

At a mass gathering in the U.S. right now, the "chance that no one is sick is almost zero," he said.

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner this week halted the remainder of the city's biggest annual event, the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, after the first area coronavirus case not tied to international travel. "That changed things," he said at a news conference.

But 85 miles away, in Beaumont, organizers of the big annual South Texas State Fair, set to start March 26, are proceeding. They will cancel if mandated to do so, but hope that doesn't happen, said Marc Richardson, a lead volunteer. The fair raises money for children's causes.

Mr. Richardson, who thinks there may be excessive panic about the coronavirus, hadn't been surprised to see Austin shut down the South by Southwest festival over coronavirus concerns, but was stunned to hear about Houston.

"Austin is much more of a liberal area, but Houston?" he said. "That's the closest thing we have to the Wild West."

Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said she welcomed Mr. Inslee's approach, which was made in consultation with city officials and based on modeling that estimated a 50% reduction of contact through social distancing could result in a 75% to 80% reduction in the number of potential infections and deaths in the region through April 7. "This disease is not going to respect a city line, a county line or state lines," she said.

Boeing Probe Centers on Claim MAX Trainer Misled Regulators

Federal authorities are seeking to build a criminal case against a former Boeing Co. pilot based on statements from U.S. air-safety regulators who say he failed to provide them crucial details about the 737 MAX jet's flight-control system, according to people familiar with the matter.

A pair of Federal Aviation Administration officials who dealt with Boeing pilot Mark Forkner on pilot-training requirements for the FAA's approval process years before dual crashes of the MAX are now considered key witnesses in the investigation, these people said.

The central role of FAA officials Stacey Klein and William Schubbe in the criminal probe hasn't been reported before. It suggests Justice Department prosecutors and federal investigators are seeking to center a fraud case on claims that Mr. Forkner misled regulators about how a flight-control feature known as MCAS worked. Ms. Klein oversaw MAX pilot manuals and training, while Mr. Schubbe is a manager in the FAA office that helps determine pilot-training requirements for new aircraft.

The automated MCAS system has been blamed for putting two Boeing 737s into fatal nosedives within five months, taking 346 lives, prompting a grounding of the fleet and creating the most serious corporate crisis in Boeing's history.

A case against Mr. Forkner -- who left Boeing for a job with Southwest Airlines Co. after the MAX was certified by the FAA -- could lead to liability for the Chicago aerospace giant as well. Prosecutors typically have grounds to charge a company for criminal conduct once they have formally accused an employee of misconduct.

Mr. Forkner hasn't cooperated with the investigation, according to people familiar with his situation.

Mr. Forkner's attorneys, David Gerger and Matt Hennessy, said the FAA was aware of how MCAS worked.

"As far as Mark goes, he did his job honestly, and his communications to the FAA were honest," Mr. Forkner's lawyers said. "As a pilot and Air Force vet, he would never jeopardize the safety of other pilots or their passengers. That is what any fair investigation would find."

Boeing has cooperated with the federal investigations. It has said it was investigating the circumstances surrounding Mr. Forkner's 2016 messages and would share its findings with authorities. Boeing has faulted flawed engineering assumptions about how pilots would respond to MCAS cockpit emergencies, and it is devising software and training fixes.

Boeing also must navigate an end to a civil investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, one of the people said, which could allege its disclosures to investors didn't fully communicate important facts or risks related to the 737 MAX.

Ms. Klein couldn't be reached for comment. Through an FAA spokesman, Mr. Schubbe declined to comment. The spokesman said Ms. Klein, Mr. Schubbe and their colleagues are trained to do highly specialized jobs in a professional manner.

Internal Boeing emails from Mr. Forkner, released over the past few months, described pressure he felt from Boeing superiors in 2016 and 2017 to persuade the FAA that pilots wouldn't need extra ground-simulator training on MCAS. Mr. Forkner sent other messages to Boeing employees indicating that, as part of those efforts, he misled or provided incomplete information to the agency as well as airlines and foreign regulators. Congressional investigators, along with other Boeing critics, have highlighted Mr. Forkner's casual remarks regarding safety in those messages.

Mr. Gerger, the lawyer for Mr. Forkner, has previously said the messages should be understood as the comments of employees blowing off steam "in the ups and downs of their jobs."

A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.

Mr. Forkner, who at the time was Boeing's chief technical pilot for the 737 MAX, persuaded Ms. Klein's group to remove references to MCAS from aircraft manuals, arguing pilots didn't need to know about the system because it would rarely, if ever, activate, according to his emails.

Ms. Klein has been involved in devising new pilot training for the modified MCAS system, but recently went on leave for a personal reason unrelated to the criminal investigation and the MAX, a person familiar with her testimony said. Aaron Perkins, a former commercial pilot who joined the FAA in 2011 and was involved in the MAX approval process, has taken over her role vetting training related to MCAS software fixes.

Mr. Perkins has told prosecutors he feels Mr. Forkner misled him and his colleagues before the plane went into service, according to one person familiar with his statements. Through an agency spokesman, Mr. Perkins declined to comment.

In August 2016, Ms. Klein was among the FAA employees who participated in test flights of the MAX, which used the final, more powerful version of MCAS, according to people familiar with the matter. It couldn't be learned whether those flights involved tests of MCAS or exposed its potential hazards. An earlier version of the system worked only at high speeds and was less potent.

Mr. Forkner was thrust into the spotlight last year when it emerged that in a 2016 instant message he acknowledged misleading regulators. "So I basically lied to the regulators (unknowingly)," Mr. Forkner told a fellow Boeing pilot, suggesting he hadn't known at the time he talked to the FAA that engineers had modified MCAS to make it more powerful.

Mr. Gerger has said Mr. Forkner was discussing the performance of a simulator built to mirror the handling of a 737 Max. Mr. Forkner believed the problem was with that simulator, Mr. Gerger has said, and not with the plane itself.

Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun has called Mr. Forkner's messages "totally appalling," while company representatives repeatedly have said his communications contradicted Boeing's core values and commitment to safety.

A spokeswoman for Southwest said Mr. Forkner isn't focused on MAX-related work and has complied with company and federal standards applicable to pilots.

Over the months, prosecutors have interviewed current and former Boeing engineers and pilots, airline pilot-union officials and various FAA employees, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Forkner's former boss, Zekeriya Demir, is among the other Boeing employees who have been called to testify before the grand jury hearing evidence, the people said.

Mr. Demir's testimony hasn't been reported. He couldn't be reached for comment. The New York Times previously reported that prosecutors were gathering grand jury testimony about whether Mr. Forkner misled FAA officials.

Boeing has long insisted the FAA was aware of the system's final configuration, which was described in a letter and a number of presentations to the agency, though its revised power was never flagged to senior managers.

EXCHANGE --- Harvard Pressed on Dean Search

Several stakeholders of Harvard Business School are pushing the university to name a new dean who will use the school's clout to raise awareness on social issues ranging from climate change to diversity in hiring.

Harvard Business School has been on the hunt for a new boss since November when Nitin Nohria, the current dean, said he planned to step down in June after 10 years on the job. Since then, several student and alumni groups have sent letters to the president of Harvard University, Lawrence Bacow, asking for a more diverse hire, such as a woman or person of color, or someone who will voice support for certain ideologies, such as the benefits of stakeholder-focused capitalism.

Last month, more than 250 HBS students signed a letter to the school's search committee asking that the new dean prioritize taking "the challenge of revamping the curriculum to reflect environmental and societal challenges seriously."

The letter was written by two M.B.A. students from the class of 2021, Tarun Galagali and Tomas Rosales, who co-chair the Next Generation Capitalism group on campus. The letter stated they are encouraged by the steps Harvard has taken in recent years to modernize the business school's curriculum but more can still be done. The students said they met with the provost this week in a constructive meeting to discuss the points they raise in the letter.

"The new dean should be someone who challenges orthodoxy when he or she thinks it's stale and has a track record of doing so," Mr. Galagali said in an interview.

A university spokesman declined to comment on the school's search process.

In January, HBS's African-American Alumni Association sent a letter urging Harvard's president to prioritize diversity and inclusion in the search.

The university said the search for the new dean won't be delayed despite the coronavirus outbreak, and those involved in the search process will continue to take any precautions warranted.

The current dean is facing the challenge of Harvard students finishing the semester's classes remotely via online learning platforms. Tuesday, the university told students to move out of their campus housing by Sunday and not to return until further notice.

Trevor Hill, co-president of HBS's energy and environment club, said he would like to see a dean who throws the weight of the school behind specific policy solutions that combat climate change. He sent a letter to the dean search committee in February asking for a leader who will push leaders in the corporate world for action.

Fed Slashes Rates as Slump Looms --- Central bank to buy $700 billion in debt as coronavirus pushes U.S. toward recession

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate to near zero on Sunday and unleashed an aggressive set of additional moves aimed at stabilizing markets as the new coronavirus pushed the U.S. economy toward a recession.

The Fed, delivering an unprecedented second emergency rate cut in as many weeks, said it would cut the federal-funds rate to a range between 0% and 0.25%, down 1 percentage point, and would buy $700 billion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, among other actions.

The Fed's actions capped three days of federal responses to the rising economic risks posed by the virus, including President Trump's emergency declaration Friday and the House's passage of financial-assistance legislation Saturday.

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid about 1,040 points, or 4.6%, while S&P 500 futures fell 5% to again hit a limit designed to stall further drops. Overseas early Monday, Japan's Nikkei Stock Average was up slightly, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 1.7%.

"The virus presents significant economic challenges," Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said during a telephone press conference Sunday night. "The measures now being put in place to stem its spread will have a significant effect on economic activity in the near term."

The central bank will buy at least $500 billion in Treasury securities and $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities over the coming months to help unclog markets that grew dysfunctional last week. It said it would initiate the program, called quantitative easing, on Monday.

The Fed said it was activating with five other central banks, including the European Central Bank and Bank of England, swap lines to smooth out disruptions in overseas dollar-funding markets, effectively encouraging foreign central banks to use existing facilities to supply dollars to their own financial systems.

The coronavirus crisis has escalated in recent days, with business closures and event cancellations cascading across the country. Companies sent workers home, and smaller businesses grappled with how to survive. Consumers, meanwhile, stocked up for an uncertain period where they are being asked to stay at home to combat the virus's spread.

Many Wall Street forecasters now expect the economy will fall into recession during the first half of the year, and the shape of the recovery could be determined largely by how local, state and federal health officials mitigate the spread of the virus.

"The Fed is trying to prevent a health crisis from mutating into a financial crisis," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at accounting firm Grant Thornton.

JPMorgan Chase economists project U.S. output will decline at an annual rate of 2% in the first quarter and 3% in the second. They believe the economy will rebound quickly in the second half of the year, contingent on a $500 billion fiscal response from Congress.

Intense market volatility prompted the Fed to take several unusual steps last week to arrest strains in the Treasury market. Those included offering nearly unlimited amounts of short-term lending to a group of 24 big banks, known as primary dealers, that function as the Fed's exclusive counterparties when trading in financial markets. When banks were slow to take the Fed up on those loans, it pivoted Friday to buying $37 billion in Treasurys in one swoop.

But late Friday it appeared those actions hadn't restored normal functioning in the Treasury market -- let alone in riskier ones for mortgage bonds, commercial debt and municipal credit, prompting an even bolder approach on Sunday.

"Market function improved a little bit, but still, it wasn't what we needed," Mr. Powell said Sunday.

Treasury and mortgage-bond markets "are part of the foundation of the global financial system. . .If they are not functioning well, then that will spread to other markets," Mr. Powell said.

Mortgage rates, for example, spiked last week amid signs of dysfunction in the market for mortgage bonds that are government guaranteed, which could have hurt what has been a strong housing market. "They can't allow that to happen," Ms. Swonk said.

Over the weekend, the House passed legislation that would make testing for the novel coronavirus free and provide paid sick leave to certain workers affected by the outbreak, and Washington leaders promised more aid was coming. The bill is likely to clear the Senate this week before President Trump signs it into law.

Congress had already approved about $8 billion in funding to develop virus treatments and help for states. Mr. Trump issued on Friday an emergency declaration that he said would free up tens of billions of dollars in emergency funding.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday that he doesn't think the U.S. is in a recession, but that the administration would continue working with Congress to combat the virus's spread and help the economy.

Let the Fed Administer an Antiviral Shot

If you've seen one financial crisis, you've seen one financial crisis.

The policy pronouncements and tools used in 2008 by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and his crisis-fighters weren't designed to address the current threat. Yet Chairman Jerome Powell fired a 2008-style barrage Sunday evening.

Cutting interest rates to near zero, purchasing hundreds of billions of long-term Treasury bonds and agency securities, making commitments to hold rates down for a long time -- the monetary arsenal of 2008-09 -- will likely be of only modest help this time around. The old weapons must be paired with new ones fit for the 2020 pandemic.

The novel coronavirus has been moving faster than the world's economic policy makers, threatening to shut down the global economy as it approaches. Yet the Fed possesses powerful untapped authority, and with the help of Congress and the administration there is much it can do to improve economic prospects.

U.S. public-health officials acknowledge that the window to contain the virus has passed. They have pivoted to a policy of mitigation, trying to buy time so that the health-care system can manage the influx of cases. Economic policy makers must make an equally forceful pivot to save the economy from a deep and painful recession.

In consultation with the Treasury secretary and congressional leaders, the Fed should immediately invoke its emergency powers under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act and establish a new credit facility to ensure that sound businesses and households have ready access to cash to get through the crisis.

A new Government-Backed Credit Facility, or GBCF, would require everyone to have skin in the game: all parts of the government, all institutions in the banking system, and a broad cross-section of small businesses, large corporations and households.

The Fed board of governors would authorize the program and ensure its accord with Walter Bagehot's dictum: lend freely to solvent firms and individuals on good collateral at interest rates higher than are customary.

Thousands of regulated banks would be on the front lines. They would underwrite loans based on the quality and value of collateral and the expected cash flows of borrowers, evaluating applicants based on their credentials as of Jan. 1, before the pandemic. Borrowers would need to demonstrate that they are unable to obtain credit elsewhere but are solvent, consistent with the requirements of the Federal Reserve Act.

The 12 geographically dispersed banks in the Federal Reserve system would judge whether the loans underwritten in their region pass muster. The New York Fed would evaluate each package of loans, and price them at spreads modestly higher than would be customary in normal times.

Loans would be for a term of up to 90 days, subject to renewal as long as the virus is affecting the economy. The GBCF would have a maximum life of 18 months. If the virus dissipates quickly, the Fed's program would be wound down quickly as well.

The president could authorize the Treasury secretary to use funds from the Exchange Stabilization Fund to kick-start the program by providing assurance to the Fed that there is sufficient collateral to support it. Crucially, Congress would also authorize a fiscal backstop to offset any loan losses incurred by the Fed or the banks themselves. These actions would maintain an appropriate line between monetary and fiscal policy.

The establishment of the GBCF is the right response to this crisis. The economy was fundamentally strong and prospects were promising before the onset of the pandemic. U.S. households' earnings were growing at the highest rate in decades, and the household savings rate was high. Business profit levels remained strong, and the banking system was sound.

Owing to the virus, many U.S. households and businesses are expected to face a liquidity crisis. It must be managed quickly and effectively so it doesn't turn into a solvency crisis. More traditional Keynesian fiscal stimulus to spur immediate consumer spending is at odds with the public-health measures adopted by the president to slow economic activity for a time.

In 2008, I recall sitting along the wall of the Roosevelt Room at the White House. Mr. Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson sat at the main table across from President George W. Bush. They were seeking the president's support for a set of extraordinary policy moves to help the U.S. economy survive the financial crisis. Mr. Bush listened intently, and before granting his approval, he said something that caused me to take particular note. In paraphrase: "When this is over, you guys better think hard how this all happened and why we were all so unprepared. No one sitting in these chairs again should find themselves with so few options."

Policy makers should have used the long period after the financial crisis to give more consideration to the eternally salient question: What could possibly go wrong? But now is no time for navel gazing, or cutting and pasting the response from the last crisis. Policy makers should move with dispatch and confidence to a new paradigm to respond to a different kind of economic shock.

At a time of government dysfunction and division, pettiness and partisanship, the Fed would be wise to lead the effort, consistent with its mission as lender of last resort, with support and backstop funding from the administration and Congress.

U.S. News: Roundabout Wrecks Have Engineers Going in Circles

City planners and engineers are stumped over why so many drivers can't handle something as simple as a roundabout.

Roundabouts have proliferated around the U.S. in recent years, arriving in some areas of the Midwest and West for the first time. Yet even years after some are installed, driver confusion persists. And with confusion comes fender-benders.

Traffic engineers say the majority of crashes in two-lane roundabouts occur either because drivers don't yield to circulating traffic, or they make improper lane changes once in the roundabout.

Authorities have boosted public education, tweaked signs and modified roadway designs in search of solutions. The federal government is leading a study on drivers' failure to yield to traffic when entering two-lane roundabouts, a major cause of collisions. State transportation departments from Washington to New York are helping fund the research.

"We just need to find out a reason why," said Wei Zhang, who manages intersection-safety research at the U.S. Department of Transportation.

Roundabouts differ from higher-speed rotaries common in the Northeast. While they can have multiple lanes, they are smaller than rotaries and often require cars to slow down to around 15 miles an hour.

Converting an intersection with a traffic signal to a roundabout results in a 78% decrease in fatalities and injuries, according to the Federal Highway Administration. The downside has been more crashes, mostly fender-benders, at many two-lane roundabouts.

The crash problem has been a "dirty little secret" in the traffic field, said Letty Schamp, deputy engineer for the city of Hilliard, Ohio. "Now people are talking about it."

Ms. Schamp considers one roundabout her baby because she has worked on the project since it began more than a decade ago, when the area had few roundabouts. The two-lane circular intersection has had more than 660 crashes since it opened in 2012, averaging 82 a year. That is compared with eight a year at the intersection that existed previously, city figures show.

The roundabout was intended to add capacity and improve traffic flow while reducing speeds, without creating a sea of asphalt, and it achieved those goals, she said. About 35,000 vehicles pass through each day.

Hilliard resident Pam Saraniero didn't realize she had to yield to cars in both lanes of the roundabout, and learned the hard way. In January, she said she saw a Ford Escape moving in the inner lane as she approached the roundabout. Then she drove into the circle, hitting the Escape and knocking the front bumper off her Honda Accord.

In hindsight, she said she wrongly assumed the other driver would loop around the roundabout rather than exit across her path. "It was my fault, absolutely," the 67-year-old retiree said.

Jane Wahl, who also crashed there in January, said approaching drivers often race into the roundabout. "Not everybody has the same attitude about what the rules are in these roundabouts," she said.

Last year, Hilliard launched a public-outreach campaign, and officials modified signs and lane markings. The 63 crashes in 2019 were the fewest since the roundabout opened, though Ms. Schamp said she isn't ready to declare victory. While she remains bullish on roundabouts, she said she isn't keen to build any more two-lane versions.

Of the more than 6,000 modern roundabouts that have been built since around 1990, roughly a quarter have multiple lanes in some configuration, according to a database maintained by Oregon transportation engineering firm Kittelson & Associates Inc.

"We're trading a severe crash -- say, a T-bone crash at a conventional signalized intersection -- for a fender-bender. Nine out of 10 engineers are willing to make that trade," said Lee Rodegerdts, a principal engineer at Kittelson, which is working on the federal study. "It's a fender-bender problem, but it's one we're very actively trying to solve."

WASHINGTON -- President Trump said he is considering a full pardon for former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with a top Russian official.

Mr. Trump in a tweet Sunday criticized the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department, saying they had "destroyed" Mr. Flynn's life, and pointed to what he said was a report that the agencies had "lost" records in the case. It wasn't clear what report Mr. Trump was referring to.

"I am strongly considering a Full Pardon!" he wrote.

The White House didn't comment beyond the tweet, which came as the administration continues to grapple with the fast-moving coronavirus emergency. The FBI and Justice Department declined to comment.

Mr. Flynn in late 2017 admitted he misled FBI agents about a series of calls he had with Moscow's ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, about sanctions and a United Nations resolution critical of Israel. Prosecutors said Mr. Flynn consulted with Trump transition officials on the contacts.

"I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and, through my faith in God, I am working to set things right," Mr. Flynn said at the time.

Federal prosecutors in January asked a court to sentence Mr. Flynn to up to six months in prison, a reversal from when the government said he shouldn't face incarceration due to cooperation in the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mr. Flynn sat for 19 interviews with investigators and provided documents in several criminal probes before the relationship soured.

Mr. Flynn's lawyers subsequently asked a federal judge to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea on a single charge of lying to the FBI, arguing the government had breached its 2017 plea agreement. If that request, which is pending, is granted, Mr. Flynn could face trial.

Don't Credit the Minimum Wage for Growing Paychecks

There's a great irony in the current battle over labor policy. Demands are rising for a $15 minimum wage nationwide at exactly the moment when businesses have returned to granting the most robust raises in many years, with no government mandate necessary. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Usual Weekly Earnings survey, most workers' wages rose a bit more than 10% from December 2016 through December 2019, and those in the bottom 10% got a raise of 15.6%.

Supporters of the higher federal minimum claim that state and local minimum-wage increases are the main cause of recent wage growth. "Minimum wages probably are the difference that are kicking up wage growth at the bottom to higher levels than other groups in America," policy economist Ernie Tedeschi told NPR in January. Yet the data refute the idea that forced raises at the low end have done more to boost wages than the trends in the economy.

For starters, relatively few people earn the minimum wage. According to the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey, only 119,000 workers on average had their pay raised directly by each of the 51 state and local minimum-wage hikes between 2016 and 2019. That's because even those in the 10th income decile -- people who earn less than 90% of their peers -- made $467 a week in December 2019. That's $11.52 an hour, far higher than the federal minimum of $7.25 as well as most state and local minimum wages.

All told, the recent minimum-wage hikes directly increased total wages by $4.2 billion over a three-year period, including for workers whose wages fell somewhere between the old and new minimums. But the increase in wages for production and nonsupervisory workers (those likely to be paid hourly) over that period was $325 billion. So minimum-wage hikes directly accounted for only 1.3% of the total increase in the earnings of hourly workers over that period.

The effect was more concentrated at the bottom. The minimum-wage increases amounted to an $8 increase in weekly pay for the bottom 10% of earners. But the same workers' overall weekly earnings rose by $63 during that period, meaning minimum-wage hikes were responsible for only 13% of their pay gains. The hikes accounted for a mere 5% of the pay gains for the bottom quarter of workers and only 2% of the gains for the bottom half.

To be sure, minimum-wage increases can cause broader raises indirectly by spurring employers to fend off competition with even larger increases. That's the theory advanced by Mr. Tedeschi and others, who interpret the coincidence of mandatory wage hikes and broader raises as a sign of the stimulating power of raising the wage floor. But again, the share of workers who earn anything close to that wage floor is too small to assume that a higher minimum could meaningfully boost wages for the entire bottom quarter. And the fact that unemployment plummeted in the same period shows that the tightening of the labor market was the more likely cause.

The outsize gains at the bottom of the income distribution have been particularly pronounced among African-Americans, whose weekly pay rose 12% from 2016 to 2019, compared with 9.8% for whites. This trend appears to be accelerating. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's Wage Growth Tracker found wage growth for nonwhites exceeding that for whites by 0.8% in the past 12 months -- the equivalent of 2.5% over a three-year period. Before the end of 2016 there was little difference in terms of wage growth between whites and nonwhites.

Other data tell a similarly encouraging story. Inequality dropped under every census measure from 2017 to 2018, bucking a half-century trend. There are signs that we'll see another drop from 2018 to 2019 when the data are published this summer. This is a trend that should be heralded by all Americans. It is proof that the best way to create a more equal distribution of income is to have a robust economy and tight labor market. Long-term economic equality can be achieved not by government decree but by sustaining an economy in which the labor market allows the laws of supply and demand to strengthen workers' positions.

World News: Netanyahu Rival Gets First Shot To Form Coalition

TEL AVIV -- Israel's President Reuven Rivlin will give opposition leader Benny Gantz the first chance to form a government in a blow to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is seeking to hold on to the country's top office while facing charges of corruption.

Mr. Rivlin met throughout the day Sunday with all of the representatives from all of the parties in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, before announcing he will officially offer Mr. Gantz the mandate on Monday.

He then met with Messrs. Gantz and Netanyahu to urge them to form a unity government, or a coalition including parties from both sides of the political spectrum.

Mr. Rivlin views the common political front as essential medicine to combat the threat of the coronavirus in Israel.

Mr. Gantz, beginning Monday, has up to six weeks to try to cobble together a governing coalition after receiving the most support to do so from the members of Israel's 120-seat parliament.

The decision follows three inconclusive elections in the space of a year that has landed Israel in a prolonged state of political paralysis, a situation that has allowed Mr. Netanyahu to hang on as Israel's longest-serving prime minister despite being indicted on a charge of corruption and facing a court trial. The stalemate has prevented Israel's parliament from passing a budget that would fund the government's operations.

"The biggest issue is there's no real budget, they can't do anything without that," said Mitchell Barak, a political analyst and director at Keevoon Global Research, a Jerusalem-based consulting firm. "They need a government and not to go to fourth elections."

Americas
Economic Flu Stalks Latin America

If it's true the novel coronavirus doesn't like warm weather, it could explain why Latin America has yet to report a large outbreak. Much of the region isn't tropical, but most of the temperate zones in the Northern Hemisphere have mild winters, and in many places spring is already arriving.

Too bad the annual thaw can't save the Americas from the economic consequences of a pandemic, exacerbated by a decade of easy money. The meltdown in global stock markets suggests something deeper than a corona recession is at work. And as a version of the old saw goes, when the U.S. gets sick, Latin America gets a lot sicker.

The explanation for the slowdown in the real economy is Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Transmission of the illness isn't well understood, the severity of individual cases varies greatly, and public-health authorities are having trouble getting a grip on how many people have been infected.

The virus killed a 34-year-old doctor in Wuhan, China, who attempted to warn his country about it. That authorities in Beijing initially tried to silence him raises questions about China's claim that it has quickly contained the disease's spread. Transparency isn't one of the Communist Party's strengths.

Yet business investment in the U.S. was already trending down before the virus hit, and we're overdue for a recession. Even the pandemic doesn't explain the severity of the stock-market downdraft last week. Yes, there is the madness of crowds, but that too is an unsatisfying narrative. Something else is going on.

That something is fear about U.S. financial-system stability. The immediate concern for central banks is a liquidity squeeze that paralyzes lending and brings down healthy institutions. Walter Bagehot's sage advice in his 1873 book, "Lombard Street," was that to avoid panics, central banks, as lenders of last resort, need to make liquidity freely available to solvent institutions, but at a premium.

On Thursday the Federal Reserve announced $1.5 trillion in short-term funding to keep financial markets from seizing up, though there's no penalty rate. A shortage of dollars in Asia last week hit Japanese and Korean bonds. Access to swap lines should alleviate some of that pressure, and Mexico's central bank also has swap privileges at the Fed. Other central banks in the region don't, and they will feel the pinch.

A greater concern is whether the U.S. financial system is facing a solvency crisis, i.e., too many loans going bad and pulling one or more banks under. The Fed doesn't reassure with its announcement Sunday that it will not only cut its benchmark interest rate to near zero but also buy $700 billion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities.

The purchases are ostensibly to ensure "the flow of credit." But this "quantitative easing" was last seen after the 2008 financial crisis, when poorly managed financial institutions were desperate to avoid insolvency and repair their balance sheets.

The worry that banks might be in trouble again is reflected in markets. Bank stocks rallied Friday after the Fed promised to intervene, but bank equity prices were diving more than the broad indexes most of the week. On Wednesday the Journal reported that "the cost of insuring against default on Citigroup debt for five years rose to $115,000 annually from $40,000 this week, according to FactSet." The price remained "well below the panicked pricing seen in 2008," but the surge indicated something amiss.

The benign explanation is an expectation that bank profits will underperform as interest rates swoon. But the quality of loan portfolios is also a consideration. So is the adequacy of the stress testing banks have faced since the last crisis.

In an April 2013 speech in Basel, Switzerland, Thomas Hoenig, then vice chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., warned deposit insurers that the practice of risk-weighting assets was creating an "illusion that banking organizations have adequate capital to absorb unexpected losses." If that's true it would go a long way in explaining fear about banks' exposure to this downturn. There are also the uncertainties of the humongous and nontransparent interest-rate swap market, where major banks are counterparties to each other.

If the financial system is still shaky after a decade of Fed subsidies, it implies that absurdly low interest rates and quantitative easing have been counterproductive. Grandma has been eating cat food while the banks remain fragile. This is bad for those of us who prefer liberty to socialism.

Former Salvadoran Finance Minister Manuel Hinds writes in his forthcoming book, "Our 1776 Moment: A Defense of Liberal Democracy," that the damage from the bailout in 2008 went "much beyond economic losses. The crisis and its solution destroyed the faith that people had put in capitalism and liberal democracy." Enter Bernie Sanders.

The U.S. may yet fight off a lurch to the left. But the ripple effect in Latin America, where collectivists perpetually rail against markets, is worrisome.

World News: U.S. Mulls Troop Cuts Amid Terror Threats

NOUAKCHOTT, Mauritania -- At the closing ceremony of U.S.-led military exercises in this expansive Saharan nation, American diplomat R. Clarke Cooper stepped to the podium and assured African military commanders that Washington stands ready to help them in their time of need.

"The U.S. has an unwavering and longstanding commitment to Africa," Mr. Cooper, the State Department's assistant secretary for political-military affairs, said late last month.

In fact, U.S. allies are increasingly worried that America's commitment may be wavering when wide swaths of Africa face a surging threat from militants affiliated with al Qaeda and Islamic State.

U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper is conducting a world-wide review of troop commitments, in keeping with the Trump administration's strategic tilt away from dispersed actions against terror groups and toward great-power competition with China and Russia.

Africa is the first region on Mr. Esper's list, and military officers and lawmakers expect him to order fresh troop reductions on the continent, on top of the 17% cut in personnel over the past two years. The Pentagon hasn't said when he will announce his decision.

The Pentagon has already sliced some 1,200 personnel from its rolls in Africa since deployments there hit a peak in 2018. It now has 6,000 troops and civilians concentrated in Niger in the west and in Somalia and Djibouti in the east. Instead of combat power, the U.S. offers specialized support for those doing the fighting.

Africa's security situation is especially serious in the middle of the Sahel, the semiarid belt between the Sahara to the north and more tropical lands to the south. The number of extremist attacks in the Sahelian heartland -- Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali, across the border from Mauritania -- is doubling annually, to 803 last year from 55 in 2015, according to Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project figures assembled by the Pentagon's Africa Center for Strategic Studies. More than 4,000 civilians and African soldiers died in attacks in the three countries last year, up from 770 in 2016, the United Nations reported.

A sequence of attacks against military and civilian targets has sent more than one million people fleeing south in Burkina Faso alone in recent months, creating what aid agencies are calling the world's fastest-growing refugee crisis.

France, which colonized much of the Sahel, leads the West's military response to the crisis. Paris has 4,500 troops stationed in West Africa and is adding 600 reinforcements.

France is contributing hundreds of troops to a major offensive by some 5,000 West African soldiers where the borders of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger come together and where militants maneuver freely among isolated villages, according to African officers. The French Ministry of Defense declined to comment.

U.S. troops don't conduct unilateral counterterrorism raids or airstrikes in West Africa, unlike in Somalia, where they carry out frequent air attacks on al-Shabaab militants. In 2017, four U.S. servicemen and five Nigerien soldiers were killed when their patrol was ambushed by fighters from the Islamic State of the Greater Sahara. The U.S. military subsequently barred its troops from accompanying West African forces on such operations.

U.S. support includes aerial refueling for warplanes, air transport for troops and supplies, and airborne surveillance by drones at a new, $110 million U.S.-built base in Agadez, Niger. U.S. Green Beret teams are stationed in Niger to mentor elite local units, and American commandos periodically visit Burkina Faso to train its forces, according to officers from those countries.

The U.S. won't say publicly whether it is providing intelligence or other assistance in the new offensive, which is targeting Islamic State of the Greater Sahara and a collection of al Qaeda affiliates operating as Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin, or JNIM. The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency estimates JNIM's strength at 1,000 to 2,000 fighters.

"You don't want your boys at the front? Give us training with the Special Forces," said Maman Sidikou, permanent secretary of the G5 Sahel, a grouping of five West African countries, which is fielding the African battalions for the operation.

U.S. Africa Command is already pulling back from a strategy of trying to "degrade" extremist groups to simply attempting to "contain" them, according to a report to Congress last month by a Pentagon inspector general.

The U.S. is pressing its European allies, who also train regional military and police forces, to fill whatever gaps it may leave. "It is about expanding that burden-sharing," Mr. Cooper told reporters.

During a visit to Washington in January, France's defense minister, Florence Parly, stood next to Mr. Esper as she told reporters that a reduction in U.S. support would "severely limit" the effectiveness of French operations in the Sahel.

U.S. officials tried to calm nerves among the Africans gathered for the exercises in Mauritania. "A posture review doesn't always equate with absence or reduction" of forces, Mr. Cooper said in an interview.

Brig. Gen. Dagvin Anderson, commander of U.S. special-operations forces in Africa, said he told his African counterparts that the U.S. isn't pulling up stakes completely. "A small footprint can have a large impact," he said in an interview.

Still, the possibility of a drawdown has sparked a rare show of bipartisanship in Congress.

"Any reduction in U.S. military presence in West Africa would have real and lasting negative consequences for our African partners," Sen. Jim Inhofe (R., Okla.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said after leading a congressional delegation to Mauritania last month.

Sen. Inhofe is among the lawmakers and counterterrorism officials warning that a U.S. pullback could also provide an opportunity for China and Russia to expand their influence in Africa, the very phenomenon the administration says it is trying to prevent in its global reshuffling of forces.

Nigerien officials are desperate for Americans to deepen their involvement instead of stepping back. Nigerien commanders would like U.S. Green Berets to resume joint patrols with their men. And Niger's government would welcome U.S. airstrikes against militants inside the country, said a senior Nigerien official. "They can kill anyone they'd like," the official said, not entirely joking.

Business News: Airbus Copter Deals Scrutinized

Airbus SE executives raised concerns about fees paid to a number of middlemen working with its helicopter division, led at the time by the company's current chief executive, according to internal documents related to Airbus's $4 billion bribery settlement in January.

In that settlement, U.S., U.K, and French prosecutors alleged Airbus inappropriately paid middlemen to secure orders at its commercial-aviation and its defense and space units. Internal documents submitted to investigators in the probe and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal show Airbus executives raised red flags about payments to middlemen at the helicopter unit.

The division at the time of the internal scrutiny was headed by Guillaume Faury, who took over last year as Airbus's group chief executive. Suspect helicopter deals were flagged for various reasons, according to the documents.

Some middlemen payments appeared to executives as excessive compared with the underlying helicopter orders involved, according to the documents. Others were flagged, according to the documents, for what executives suspected was improper due diligence or lack of supporting paperwork. Airbus executives made no final determinations about the propriety of the helicopter deals in the documents viewed by the Journal.

Mr. Faury, who headed the helicopter unit from 2013 to 2018, declined to comment.

Airbus, citing "legal reasons," said it couldn't comment on specific cases covered by the investigation.

Mr. Faury is one of a handful of senior executives who have remained on Airbus's executive committee in the wake of the bribery investigation that led to the biggest-ever international settlement of corporate bribery charges.

Britain's Serious Fraud Office, the agency that led the investigation for the U.K., found that none of Airbus's current board, including Mr. Faury, was implicated in any of the allegations they made public as part of the settlement. The SFO said it "has no evidence that the current Executive Committee members knew of the corrupt practices or culture of Airbus."

The documents, which haven't been made public and haven't previously been reported, include minutes of meetings by Airbus executives tasked with reviewing how to exit contracts with middlemen that might have fallen afoul of global bribery and corruption rules.

Overall, about 110 partnerships with third-party agents working for Airbus's various units were flagged by executives as suspicious in the internal review, which was then used to help prosecutors in their outside probes. British and French prosecutors brought forward 13 counts against the company related to those deals. None of them was related to helicopter sales.

Prosecutors have said publicly they narrowed the scope of their probe to concentrate on the biggest deals with the clearest evidence of alleged wrongdoing. They have said they are now probing the actions of individuals, after settling with Airbus.

The settlement with prosecutors included a deferred prosecution agreement, in which Airbus wasn't required to admit or deny specific wrongdoing. Prosecutors said they won't investigate any further deals that have been disclosed by Airbus. Those would include the helicopter deals discussed in the internal documents.

Airbus first conducted an internal review into the full extent of its third-party relationships in late 2013, according to prosecutors. An Airbus audit found "significant breaches of compliance policies" in Airbus's relationship with its third-party agents, they said. It reported the issues to investigators and the company has cooperated in the various probes.

Airbus decided to freeze all payments outstanding for deals in its commercial aircraft division, which accounts for the lion's share of its overall revenue. That freeze later extended to its other divisions, defense and space, and helicopters.

After its internal audit, Airbus set up what executives termed the "liquidation committee," in an effort to unwind relationships with scores of agents it was using around the world, prosecutors have said.

Payments to middlemen in Thailand and South Korea related to helicopter sales were deemed as excessive by the committee, while the level of remuneration for its agent in China was ordered to be reviewed, according to minutes of the committee's deliberations, reviewed by the Journal.

The committee asked for due diligence of its agents in Japan and Indonesia to be checked and updated, according to the minutes. All proposed contracts in Brazil were put on hold, while contracts in Argentina were initially allowed to proceed under new compliance rules that were stricter and limited the amount payable to the local agent.

The committee was tasked with deciding how to deal with suspect contracts, whether by continuing to honor them, through settlements or by refusing to pay. The decisions were based in part on whether the amount of money promised to the agents was justifiable, according to the documents.

Heard on the Street
Fed Can Probably Handle Hit To Markets --- It seems willing to do what is necessary

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

The coronavirus is putting the financial system that emerged from last decade's banking crisis to the test. Initially, markets appeared to pass. Over the past few days, they have started to buckle.

The good news is that the Federal Reserve learned a lot during the 2008 crisis. If it doesn't renege on its unofficial role as the world's market maker, it should be in a position to fix most problems.

On Sunday, the Fed surprised the market by slashing rates to zero and agreeing to buy $700 billion in Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities. This follows Friday's smaller commitment and a $1.5 trillion liquidity injection unveiled Thursday.

These are necessary steps after a turbulent week in which fund values have shown signs of dislocating from the value of the assets they own, an uncomfortable echo of 2008. Even the market for U.S. government bonds, the safest and most liquid in the world, is under pressure. Over recent trading sessions, Treasury yields have bounced back -- an oddity in times of panic. Relative to derivatives markets in which investors bet on future interest rates, Treasurys are trading at their steepest discount since the global financial crisis.

Before panicking, though, investors should recall that the Fed has what it takes to mend the market plumbing. Its latest actions should at least ease any potential concern about Treasurys -- an essential haven asset for the entire world -- being safe. It confirms that, ultimately, sovereign debt is always backed by the central bank.

Another concern last week, particularly in global markets, was dollar scarcity. On Thursday, spreads on euro and yen cross-currency basis swaps -- an instrument often used by companies outside the U.S. to borrow greenbacks in exchange for their own currencies -- jumped to levels reminiscent of the 2011 euro crisis, during which international lenders scrambled to source dollars.

Over the past decade, investors repeatedly warned about new regulations clogging the arteries of the financial system. Banks are safer, but face higher costs for expanding their balance sheets and must hold more liquid assets. This is supposed to prevent a scenario like the fall of 2008, when they had to sell in a panic and drove markets into a collapse.

The flip side is banks can no longer handle all the securities that fund managers are eager to trade -- a problem that may have extended to Treasurys. Nor can they extend short-term loans as freely, constraining the supply of dollars.

The Fed is mulling an easing of bank liquidity rules and its actions over recent days could help ease the problem of dollar scarcity if U.S. banks lend it abroad. If not, the Fed now has "swap lines" with its established peers abroad. This system, established after the last crisis, means the U.S. can easily provide dollars to Western countries that need them.

Over the past few years, central banks bought a lot of corporate paper through quantitative-easing programs. This has had little effect on the economy, but is a key tool to ensure market liquidity that the Fed could deploy. Emergency facilities tested out in 2008 could also make a comeback.

This doesn't mean that all market distortions can be fixed. For one, the brutality of the recent rout was likely exacerbated by the large number of traders betting against volatility in the preceding months. And when it comes to the economic impact of Covid-19, monetary policy can do very little.

But investors should take solace from these early signs that -- perhaps unlike the European Central Bank -- the Fed seems committed to ensuring the smooth functioning of markets. When it comes to market liquidity, a virus cannot win a fight with the U.S. central bank.

Golden Gates

By Conor Dougherty

(Penguin Press, 269 pages, $28)

The Yes in My Backyard (Yimby) Act, introduced by Reps. Trey Hollingsworth (R., Ind.) and Denny Heck (D., Wash.), recently passed the House of Representatives. The bill requires cities seeking community-development funds from the federal government to report their progress in removing local regulatory obstacles, such as restrictive zoning rules or onerous permitting processes, that hamper housing affordability by limiting new construction.

The term "Yimby" in the bill's title is a play on Nimby, or "not in my backyard," the moniker given to a person who, while not necessarily opposed to new housing, strongly opposes development in his own neighborhood. A Yimby, by contrast, is much more likely to offer unconditional support for new housing, wherever it might go.

The Yimby Act aims to prod expensive cities and suburbs into accommodating more affordable housing. And though it won't unleash a flood of pro-housing reform, the information the bill aims to collect will help the federal government better understand the problem. It also signals a growing bipartisan consensus that regulatory burdens in local housing markets are a source of regional and national impediments to economic growth and upward mobility.

To wit, the housing plans advanced by a number of this year's Democratic presidential candidates included policies to loosen local housing regulations. In June, President Trump signed an executive order to create the White House Council on Eliminating Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing. State legislatures from Texas to California, North Carolina to Oregon are advancing bipartisan bills to alleviate regulatory burdens on housing growth. It is a sign of the deep dysfunction in local housing markets that the tedious details of local zoning codes are now the subject of scrutiny from state and federal lawmakers.

Those wishing to understand how we got here would do well to start with California, where the crisis of housing affordability is most acute. And for a compelling and accessible overview of the state's housing crisis, there is no better book than Conor Dougherty's "Golden Gates: Fighting for Housing in America."

Mr. Dougherty, a reporter at the New York Times and, formerly, The Wall Street Journal, has a gift for telling the stories of people struggling to overcome California's housing dysfunction: the teenager fighting a rent increase that would displace her family; the three brothers who share one room in a house that is already home to seven other people; the enterprising builder who assumes massive regulatory risk to experiment with modular housing; the Catholic nun who tangles with real-estate investors to buy up apartment buildings and deed-restrict them as forever affordable. Absorbed in these narratives, the reader hardly realizes he is receiving an education on the political economy of California's housing market.

California is home to four of the five most expensive metropolitan areas in the country. In relatively affordable Raleigh, N.C., the ratio of the median house price to the median income in 2019 was 3.8. In Los Angeles, that ratio was 9. And for a state that desperately needs housing, California is bad at building it: In 2018 it ranked 32nd among states on new-housing permits per capita. The San Francisco Bay Area, the focus of much of Mr. Dougherty's book, built one unit of housing for every 5.4 jobs added between 2011 and 2017.

Early in his book, Mr. Dougherty recounts how Larry Katz, now a labor economist at Harvard, sounded the alarm over California's housing market in a 1981 valedictory speech to the University of California, Berkeley. During the 1970s, Bay Area housing prices had gone from not much more than the national median to exceeding it by more than 50%. Mr. Katz observed that the demand for housing alone could not explain deteriorating affordability. After all, California experienced even stronger demand in the 1950s and '60s without a similar price surge.

But in the 1970s the antidevelopment sentiments of existing homeowners, often masked by a facade of limits-to-growth environmentalism, began to harden. Coupled with the passage in 1978 of Proposition 13, which strictly limited the property-tax burden on appreciating home values, the homeowners whose voices and votes shaped local policy began to block more and more proposals for new housing. As Mr. Katz put it at the time: "I believe, regrettably, that this will require some sort of state or federal action."

Decades later, Sonja Trauss, a high-school math teacher in Oakland, ignited a movement that created precisely the sort of action Mr. Katz's speech envisaged. In 2014, convinced that the only way out of the Bay Area's housing crisis was an abundance of housing, Ms. Trauss began attending public hearings in San Francisco -- a center of hostility to development -- and speaking up in favor of new housing proposals. California's Yimby movement was born, evolving rapidly from comments at public hearings to litigation against exclusionary suburbs to electing a champion of affordable housing, Scott Wiener, to the state legislature.

The trademark policy of California's Yimby movement, Mr. Wiener's Senate Bill 50, would have pre-empted local zoning rules statewide, allowing for higher-density housing development near transit and job centers. In January, as Mr. Dougherty's book was going to press, SB 50 fell three votes short in Sacramento. This setback notwithstanding, Mr. Dougherty's account makes it clear that the California Yimbys are only getting started. Barely one month after the defeat of his signature bill, Mr. Wiener introduced SB 902, a bill in the mold of SB 50 that proposes more moderate density allowances than its predecessor.

With the Yimby Act making its way through Congress and a number of states advancing pro-housing legislation to head off nascent affordability crises of their own, the fight to roll back restrictive land-use regulations in America's cities is far from over.

Cuba Is an Academic Fraud

Bernie Sanders has spent decades preparing to lose the Florida primary. In a 1985 interview, Vermont's self-described socialist said of Fidel Castro that "he educated their kids." He still praises the Communist regime's "massive literacy program."

Mr. Sanders is not alone in his admiration for Cuban education. In 2016 President Obama quoted himself as telling Raul Castro, Fidel's younger brother and successor: "You've made great progress in educating young people. Every child in Cuba gets a basic education." Dan Domenech, executive director of the American Association of School Administrators, visited Havana in 2017 and exulted: "Cuba's education system might as well be considered the ultimate wrap-around institution for children." In 2007 Stanford's Martin Carnoy published a book called "Cuba's Academic Advantage."

It's all bunk -- though it's hard to prove, because Cuba refuses to participate in international tests such as the respected Program for International Student Assessment. The only external tests in which Cuba did participate were the 1997 and 2006 waves of the Latin American Laboratory for Assessment of the Quality of Education, sponsored by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and nicknamed Laboratorio. This was the main evidentiary basis for Mr. Carnoy's book.

But the Cuban government supervised the administration of the Laboratorio tests, and the results strongly suggest it cheated. The median language-arts score for Cuban third-graders in 1997 was 343 points, compared with 264 in Argentina, 256 in Brazil and 229 in Mexico. If these scores are to be believed, the median child in Cuba learns by grade three what equivalent students elsewhere don't learn until at least grade six.

In math, median Cuban third- and sixth-grade students scored 1.5 standard deviations higher than Chileans in 2006. (A standard deviation is about two years' worth of learning.) Is Cuba a standout within Latin America, even though it won't subject itself to comparison with developed countries? That seems unlikely. Chile performed only 0.9 standard deviation lower than high-flying Finland on the Program for International Student Assessment's 2018 math test.

Belying Cuban students' sky-high scores, they don't seem to learn much from one grade to the next. In Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico, fourth-graders scored 22 to 25 points higher than third-graders on the 1997 math test. In Cuba an additional year of schooling was good for only five points. Why? One possibility is that teachers corrected the answers so that many students in both grades received perfect or near-perfect scores.

Similarly suspicious is the narrow gap -- only 0.05 standard deviation -- between urban and rural schools in Cuba. In Mexico and Brazil urban schools do better by 0.62 and 0.66 standard deviations, respectively.

It's unsurprising that a communist regime would falsify its own accomplishments. It's dismaying that American politicians, educators and scholars would fall for it.

U.S. News -- Capital Account: Don't Look to the Fed. It's Others' Turn Now

The Federal Reserve is now officially spent. Saving the U.S. economy from this point forward is now up to others.

On Sunday, the Fed used the last of its conventional monetary ammunition to counter the economic crisis triggered by the new coronavirus. It cut its short-term interest-rate target a full percentage point to between 0% and 0.25%.

The Fed has been here before, from 2008 to 2015. This time, the prospect of an escape from zero seems more uncertain, because the near-term economic shock of the pandemic adds to deeper seated forces pressing down on inflation and interest rates globally. With this cut the Fed joins the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, whose policy rates have long been at or below zero. This is what Harvard University economist Lawrence Summers has called the "monetary black hole."

"The pandemic mechanism is unexpected but it's been clear for years that some negative shock would bring us to the liquidity trap," Mr. Summers said in an email. With 10-year Treasury note yields below 0.8%, "there is virtually no juice left in monetary policy," which he said explains why markets sold off after the previous emergency half-percentage-point rate cut and after Sunday's cut.

Some critics will say the Fed should have conserved some ammo for later, but its officials have always maintained they should cut rates when the economy needs it. The rate cuts won't halt the pandemic or reopen restaurants, but they will, at the margin, help.

The Fed has some other options in its tool kit. It can buy assets, lend to banks, and alter supervisory guidance -- all part of its original mission to keep the financial system operating. These can't avert economic crisis, but they can keep it from becoming a financial crisis. Unlike in 2008, no big banks or other institutions appear to be in danger of collapse. But as in 2008, the securities markets have come under strain, which can prevent the Fed's interest-rate cuts from reaching the real economy.

Soaring volatility has saddled investors with losses, forcing them to sell Treasury bonds. As a result yields went up last week when they should have gone down, and trading in mortgage-backed securities dried up, threatening the supply of credit to housing. After failing to ease those pressures with interventions last week, the Fed on Sunday promised to buy $500 billion of Treasurys and $200 billion of mortgage-backed securities. That helped pull Treasury yields down Monday though other markets remained strained.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said this wasn't "quantitative easing," the bond buying the Fed conducted from 2008 to 2014, because its purpose was to restore market functioning, not push yields lower. The distinction is somewhat academic since the point of both is to keep yields low.

The Fed also cut the rate on direct loans from its discount window to banks by 1.5 percentage points and extended the term to up to 90 days, to help banks "meet demands for credit from households and businesses." The Fed, as a supervisor, is also encouraging banks to lend more without worrying about their capital buffers, which are above regulatory minimums. This may help, but the bigger constraint on banks is that some of their customers may go out of business because of the pandemic.

Mr. Powell said the Fed still has tools to help the economy, but that is putting on a brave face on a somewhat bleaker reality. The Fed has ruled out cutting rates below zero, as the ECB and BOJ have done. To nudge bond yields lower it can promise to keep rates at zero and buy more bonds, but with yields already so low, the benefit is likely to be slight.

The economy's fate is now in the hands of medical professionals and fiscal policy. On that, the Fed has helped by enabling the federal government to borrow all it wants at rock-bottom interest rates. Beyond that, Mr. Powell can push from the sidelines, which he did somewhat more Sunday than he has before. The House of Representatives and the White House already have agreed on a package of targeted fiscal measures, and more including industry-specific bailouts may follow.

Forecasting how long rates stay at zero is complicated by the extraordinary uncertainty around the course of the pandemic and the breadth and duration of "social-distancing" measures.

A positive scenario is a sharp but short hit to the economy. Broad swaths of activity come to a halt for a month or two, which succeeds in holding new cases to a level hospitals can manage. Restrictions on activity end and pent-up demand, goosed by fiscal and monetary stimulus, produces a V-shaped recovery.

The labor market is much stronger now than when rates last hit zero in 2008, and isn't burdened with hundreds of billions of dollars of impaired debt. Goldman Sachs sees the economy shrinking 5%, annualized, in the second quarter, then growing 3% in the third and 4% in the fourth. That would probably show "the economy has weathered recent events," Mr. Powell's stated test for reversing the rate cuts. That said, it would be politically difficult to do so before November's election.

A more pessimistic scenario is a more drawn-out pandemic, and a weaker U-shaped economic recovery, compounded by depleted stock wealth and global conflict over trade and travel. Inflation is already below the Fed's 2% target and will likely go lower because of the pandemic and an oil-price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. In such circumstances, the Fed, like the ECB and the BOJ, will struggle to justify any rate increase. "We are likely talking years before we see a rate hike again," Roberto Perli, an analyst at Cornerstone Macro, wrote to clients Sunday.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Hobbled, Africa and Latin America Brace for Outbreaks

The coronavirus has overwhelmed health-care systems in a number of highly developed nations. Now, it is spreading to some of the world's most vulnerable countries, with health officials in Africa and Latin America fearing the impact will be devastating.

At least 26 of Africa's 54 countries have confirmed cases. The prospect of a mass outbreak is particularly alarming for a region with a shortage of some 1.8 million health workers that is already suffering the world's largest disease burden, according to the World Health Organization. In 2018, an estimated 470,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa died from AIDS-related causes alone, according to the United Nations.

Sudan is among more than a dozen African nations that lacked capacity to test for the virus until early March, according to WHO. Its first case was only identified on Friday, a day after the victim, a man in his 50s, died after returning from the United Arab Emirates, Sudan's health ministry said.

In West Africa, Guinea has been beset by months of violent protests by the political opposition, upending the government's ability to provide services. There, the first case of coronavirus was detected Thursday after a European Union employee who had arrived asked to be tested.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed the nation Sunday, calling the pandemic a national emergency and saying his government was working on an economic rescue package to limit the "severe disruption" to the economy. South Africa has 61 confirmed cases.

Africa is the world's second most-populous continent and accounts for 16% of the global population -- but just 1% of health-care spending.

"Africa, especially sub-Saharan Africa, is ill-equipped and unprepared to manage outbreaks of the magnitude like coronavirus," said Dr. Chris Kaganda, a Ugandan health specialist. "There is insufficient equipment for early detection of the disease, inadequate personnel with the appropriate knowledge and skills to treat patients infected with coronavirus."

Latin America and the Caribbean, a richer region with many middle-income countries, has strong health care in a number of places. Colombia will require people arriving to the country to go into a two-week quarantine. Peru and Argentina on Sunday sealed off their borders. Peru also restricted movement within the country, allowing only essential services like supermarkets, banks and pharmacies to remain open.

Yet weak health-care systems abound in countries as varied as Haiti, which recently reported its first case, to Guyana on South America's eastern shoulder to Honduras in Central America, which is hard hit by drug trafficking.

Honduras is particularly hamstrung by corruption, which costs some $2 billion a year,equivalent to about 10% of gross domestic product, said Ismael Zepeda, an economist at Fosdeh, a think tank. That undercuts already decaying public services, experts say.

Few countries are as poorly prepared to handle an onslaught of cases as Venezuela, which reported its first two cases Friday and 15 more over the weekend. The government has banned flights from Europe and Colombia, and ordered businesses to close and people to remain at home in six states and the capital. Doctors and epidemiologists have been warning for years about the inability of the health system to fight epidemics, including dengue, yellow fever and malaria.

"We either go into quarantine or the pandemic could brutally and tragically bring down our country," Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro said Sunday.

Hospitals have lost thousands of highly trained doctors and nurses who have fled abroad, part of an exodus of some 4.5 million migrants fleeing an authoritarian regime. Many hospitals lack power, often being plunged into darkness during blackouts that force surgeons to finish operations using the light on their cellphones. About 90% of hospitals reported having intermittent or no running water last year, while half of emergency rooms aren't equipped with face masks, according to a national survey of Venezuela's biggest hospitals conducted by a network of health professionals.

"Whatever the impact is going to be in other countries, it is going to be bigger in Venezuela," said Dr. Julio Castro, an infectious disease specialist in Caracas who saw patients with symptoms of the coronavirus.

Malnutrition Leaves

Venezuela Exposed

Adding to the challenge of combating the coronavirus in Venezuela is widespread malnutrition among the people, causing weaker immune systems in those who struggle to get enough to eat due to soaring inflation and shortages of goods.

On a recent day, doctors and nurses at Caracas's University Hospital gathered for a presentation on how they should prepare for the coronavirus were reminded to washtheir hands with running water, a luxury in one of the biggest hospitals, which stores water in plastic bins.

"Every single aspect of the health crisis in Venezuela will become an accelerator, creating a severe outcome," said Irene Bosch, a scientist who has studied infectious diseases in Venezuela with the U.S. National Institutes of Health. "You are supposed to wash your hands 10 times a day. Who has water in Caracas to do that?"

World News: Israel's Gantz Moves to Assemble Coalition

TEL AVIV -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing a tougher fight for his political survival after the president formally asked former military chief Benny Gantz to try to form a new government, multiplying Mr. Netanyahu's problems as he prepares to defend himself against corruption charges.

President Reuven Rivlin's decision, made official Monday, follows another inconclusive election this month, the third in the space of a year. Four weeks of political maneuvering will now begin in which Mr. Gantz will try to stitch together a broad enough coalition from disparate parties to turn voter fatigue with Mr. Netanyahu into a government.

Mr. Gantz has more leverage this time than after the previous elections: His backers have more seats -- 61 -- in the Israeli parliament, the 120-member Knesset.

"I will make every effort to establish within days as broad a national and patriotic government as possible to serve all the citizens of Israel," Mr. Gantz said Monday.

Mr. Netanyahu's bloc of 58 lawmakers, comprising right-wing religious parties and his Likud party, sent a letter Monday to the heads of Mr. Gantz's Blue and White party and the left-wing parties backing him, offering two other options to form a government: A national unity administration with Mr. Netanyahu serving as premier for two years and then Mr. Gantz serving for the next two years, or an emergency government led by Mr. Netanyahu that would last six months before Mr. Gantz attempts to form a government.

Mr. Netanyahu's corruption trial, due to begin Tuesday, was delayed until May as part of the emergency measures. Mr. Netanyahu is being tried on bribery, fraud and breach-of-trust charges connected to allegations that he gave official favors to media moguls and businessmen in exchange for gifts and positive press coverage. He denies wrongdoing.

Mr. Gantz said little to indicate how he will try to form a government, other than that he has always wanted a united government. After receiving the mandate to try to form a government, Mr. Gantz invited each party leader in the right-wing bloc to meet and they all refused, their spokespeople said.

To become premier, Mr. Gantz will have to find sufficient common ground among the competing political parties that have vaulted him ahead of the embattled Mr. Netanyahu. He has four weeks to form a government. While the law allows for a two-week extension, he is unlikely to be granted one after so many elections.

Mr. Gantz's clearest options: form a minority government that includes his party, an alliance of left-wing parties and possibly Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beitenu party and rely on outside support from 15 lawmakers from the Joint List, a group of Israeli Arab parties; or reach an accord with Likud in which Mr. Netanyahu would serve as prime minister for a reduced period. Mr. Gantz doesn't currently have enough support within his bloc for the first option, because Mr. Lieberman and some Blue and White lawmakers oppose an arrangement that requires the support of the Arab parties.

"Netanyahu is facing the most serious threat to his power for the past 20 years. . . . He really has to be careful and make sure that he gets a good deal," said Emmanuel Navon, senior fellow at the Jerusalem-based Kohelet Policy Forum.

U.S. News: Biden Reveals Leftward Tilt Of His Party

WASHINGTON -- Joe Biden's emergence as the 2020 Democratic presidential front-runner is widely cast as a victory for moderates over progressives. But the former vice president's platform also shows how far left the party's center on economic policy has moved in recent years.

On taxes, health care, climate change and labor rights, Mr. Biden proposes a significantly bigger government role than Hillary Clinton did during her 2016 presidential bid and what the Obama-Biden ticket advocated during their two White House campaigns.

Ideological gaps still divide Democrats, as highlighted by the lingering primary contest between Mr. Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, his chief remaining rival. Mr. Sanders's sweeping plans carry a total 10-year price tag of about $50 trillion -- more than eight times Mr. Biden's agenda.

Still, Mr. Biden proposes tax and spending increases equivalent to 1.5% of U.S. gross domestic product, more than double the level Mrs. Clinton advocated four years ago and higher than the budget blueprints from the end of President Obama's term, according to a recent study by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.

"What's being called moderate now would have been the far left eight years ago," says Matthew Chingos, an education expert at the Urban Institute, a Washington-based think tank.

Mr. Biden's proposals fall well short of the debt cancellation and four-year tuition-free college plans of Mr. Sanders and former candidate Elizabeth Warren. But "the levels of new federal spending for education proposed by the Biden campaign are well above what Democratic candidates proposed four, eight, or 12 years ago," Mr. Chingos adds, citing Mr. Biden's plans to double college Pell grants for low-income students and triple funding for low-income public schools.

On Sunday, in a bid to win over voters favoring Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts senator, the Biden campaign said he was endorsing two policies similar to ones those candidates have advocated. He sweetened his higher-education plan to make four-year public colleges tuition free for some families -- albeit only those making less than $125,000 a year. And Mr. Biden vowed to make it easier for Americans to file for bankruptcy protection from creditors, softening a position he had taken as a senator to toughen the process.

"Sen. Sanders and I both agree. . .health care should be a right, not a privilege," Mr. Biden said in the Sunday night debate between the two men. "We disagree on the detail of how we do it, but we don't disagree on the principle."

President Trump is making the Democrats' leftward shift a theme of his re-election effort. "There will be no 'moderate' Democrat on the ballot in 2020," his campaign said in a statement issued after Mr. Biden's early March resurgence.

Rather than denying the charge of liberalism, some Biden aides embrace it. "The vice president is proposing the most progressive agenda since the Great Society," says Stef Feldman, the campaign policy director, asserting that many of his proposals "are dramatically to the left of traditional Democratic policy platforms."

Health care illustrates the party's shift. Mr. Biden's plan, to make Medicare available to any American who wants it, costs a fraction of Mr. Sanders's "Medicare for All" program replacing all private insurance.

But the Biden proposal is more ambitious than Mrs. Clinton's 2016 health plan. His would cost the government as much as $1.3 trillion, net, over 10 years, compared with $250 billion for hers, according to analyses by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

On climate change, Mr. Biden, along with most of the two dozen Democrats who ran for president this cycle, has called for eliminating carbon emissions by 2050, compared with the 80% reduction that was the party consensus four years ago.

Mr. Biden's open touting of tax increases is also "a reflection of changing times," said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.

In part, Mr. Biden and other Democrats see raising taxes now as mainly undoing Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts.

But Mr. Biden is also venturing beyond recent Democratic tax plans, calculating that voter concern with inequality makes taxing the rich more politically palatable.

Global View
China's Coronavirus Opportunity

As bodies are thrown into mass graves in Iran, as Italian doctors practice triage in overcrowded wards, as borders close across Europe and American cities shut down, it is hard to look past the tumult and distress of each passing day.

The full political impact of the new coronavirus, a Jet Age pandemic that is spreading through a highly integrated global economy with shattering speed, isn't yet known, and much depends on how successful efforts to mitigate its damage and find treatments and ultimately a vaccine for it will be. But on its present trajectory, the pandemic seems likely to test the international political system to an extent that few living people remember. In an ironic twist, an epidemic that started in China may end by increasing Beijing's international reach.

The pandemic has already widened the breach and sharpened the competition between the U.S. and China. While, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told me over the weekend, the U.S. has provided medical assistance to China, and while cooperation between medical and technical personnel in the two countries continues, China has used the pandemic to launch a massive propaganda and disinformation campaign -- alleging, among other claims, that Americans brought the virus to China. Despite President Trump's efforts to keep open lines of communication to President Xi Jinping, relations between the two countries are as difficult as at any time since the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989.

At first glance, the pandemic illustrates the perils of too heavy a dependence on Chinese investment and trade. As China struggles to restart its economy, disruptions in global supply chains will bring new challenges to firms around the world. In both Italy and Iran, the epidemic surged first in places with large concentrations of Chinese merchants and traders. Yet as Ian Bremmer of Eurasia Group warns, the balance may tip back in China's favor if Beijing remains focused on its global agenda and Western governments focus exclusively on their domestic concerns.

So far, with the exception of Iran, the most severe outbreaks outside China have been in wealthy countries with well-developed political and medical systems. But the greatest impact of the pandemic will likely come in less-developed countries. On top of an epidemic with which their sometimes underfunded medical systems can't cope, many countries will face a catastrophic mix of capital flight, falling commodity prices, supply-chain disruptions, slack demand for manufactured goods in a global recession, and the implosion of the tourism industry. In separate interviews, Messrs. Pompeo and Bremmer emphasized the potential consequences of the crisis on already stressed societies, with Mr. Pompeo pointing in particular to the devastating effects of the oil-price collapse for exporters in Africa and Latin America.

In the Americas, an epidemic and low oil prices will put enormous pressure on Venezuela. Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador may send new streams of migrants north as the impact of the epidemic throws those economies into a deep recession.

The massive epidemic in Iran will almost certainly spill over into war-torn Syria and Iraq, and to a Lebanon struggling to accommodate Syrian refugees amid its worst financial crisis in decades. Turkey, whose economy was already hurting before the world-wide market meltdown, is currently home to millions of refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. A deep recession in Turkey coupled with an epidemic would test President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's grip on power even as streams of desperate refugees try to enter from Syria. With the U.S. looking to reduce its engagement in the region, and Europe focused on its own problems, both Russia and China will be tempted to increase their influence in a strategic part of the world.

The African outlook is equally grim. The next months and years could see the most difficult conditions in much of Africa since the colonial era, and it is far from clear that traditional supporters in the West will come to the rescue.

There are already signs that China hopes to use the crisis to strengthen its global position. Publicity stunts like Jack Ma's donation of medical supplies to the U.S. show how Beijing intends to convert the disaster of the pandemic into global opportunities. Aid donations plus propaganda about the supposed superiority of China's governance model will find sympathetic ears in many countries, especially if the U.S. and its allies are AWOL. While the crisis lasts, China will have opportunities to deepen security, economic and political relationships with governments around the world.

As the recession hits and the pandemic bites, American, Japanese and European leaders must find ways to respond effectively to problems abroad as well as at home. If the West turns inward until the storm passes, we may not like what we see when the storm clears and we look back out on a changed world.

Investors, Keep Your Eye on the Long Run

The spread of the novel coronavirus is an economic crisis as well as a medical one. The short-term impact is evident in stock and bond market declines and volatility. But that's no reason to panic. The economic effects of calamitous events tend to dissipate in the long run, and the short-term market conditions create opportunities for savvy investors.

The 2007-08 global financial crisis is a good example of how markets bounce back from even the most severe shocks. The U.S. economy contracted by 0.1% in 2008 and 2.5% in 2009. But by 2010 the economy was growing at pre-meltdown rates, and stocks largely recovered by 2013. The crisis created ideal market conditions for purchasing certain assets and liabilities. Long-term investors like CPP Investments, which invests on behalf of Canada's pensioners, bought billions of dollars of high-quality senior loans at steep discounts with the knowledge that these loans would pay full value if held to maturity. They did, resulting in significant gains for Canadian pensioners.

The 9/11 attacks also shocked markets in the short term but left them with no significant long-term damage. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 7.1% on Sept. 17, 2001, the first day after trading resumed. In the weeks after the attacks, consumers purchased fewer goods and services than usual. But demand eventually rebounded. It took only one month for the Dow Jones, Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes to regain their pre-9/11 price levels.

A third proof point is the 1973 oil crisis. After the oil embargo caused oil prices to spike, GDP growth fell from 5.6% in 1973 to minus 0.5% in 1974 and minus 0.2% in 1975. In 1976, however, the economy came roaring back with 5.4% annual growth. GDP growth recovered within three years of the initial event, as it did following 9/11 and the 2007-08 financial crisis.

The Spanish flu of 1918-19, widely regarded as the most devastating pandemic of modern times, caused a massive supply shock as millions were unable to work. Demand cratered as people stayed home and events around the world were canceled for fear of spreading the contagion. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 40% of its value between January 1917 and January 1919 and continued to decline until December 1920. But within three years of the initial crisis, markets began to recover, then rose for nearly a decade.

The 1918-19 flu is most analogous to the global financial crisis in that it created unique opportunities for investors. According to a 2007 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, companies in the health-care and mattress industries saw increases in revenue as a result of the Spanish flu pandemic. Yet, investors with a long-term focus could have invested and achieved outstanding returns even during one of the worst health crises in history.

Collectively these events, spanning more than a century, show that markets almost always recover in the long run. Investors shouldn't ignore short-term circumstance, but neither should they abandon well-crafted plans for the future.

U.S. News: States Seek New Fraud Curbs

The governors of New York and California are proposing significant expansions of state regulatory power over consumer financial services, saying federal oversight has become lax under the Trump administration.

The expanded state agencies, the Democratic governors say, would help compensate for what they see as a lack of enforcement by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. President Obama and congressional Democrats created the CFPB in the wake of the financial crisis to help consumers harmed by problems involving mortgages and other consumer-finance products.

The proposals, if approved in two of the largest states, could lead to similar changes elsewhere and train more scrutiny on Wall Street and financial institutions across the country, legal experts say.

In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has proposed expanding the Department of Financial Services, which has become a major Wall Street watchdog in its almost decade of existence. It oversees more than 1,800 insurance companies and 1,500 financial institutions with over $7 trillion in assets combined.

Mr. Cuomo's proposal would allow DFS to seek larger financial penalties and expand its ability to investigate alleged consumer fraud. It would give the agency the ability to bring investigations like those that are authorized under the Martin Act, which currently gives the New York attorney general broad powers with which to probe securities fraud.

DFS also would gain jurisdiction over securities and companies offering investment advice. The agency could also levy civil penalties against entities that it found engaged in some types of fraud, without being required to show that the fraud was intentional.

In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed expanding and renaming the Department of Business Oversight, which oversees banks, securities brokers, investment advisers and other financial services. His proposal would increase the agency's $103 million budget by at least $19.3 million and add 90 positions to its total of nearly 600 within the next few years.

New York and California officials said they seek the new powers because of less enforcement at the federal level.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Big Downturn, Deficits Forecast --- Global recession looms as outbreak spreads, but economists see second-half U.S. pickup

U.S. households, businesses and investors should brace for a sharp economic downturn in the first half of 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic -- and hope for a bounce back during the second half.

Along the way, the government is on track to test federal budget deficit records hit after the 2008 financial crisis, when annual red ink soared past $1.5 trillion.

Those are two main messages coming from economists as they scramble to update forecasts in a fast-moving health crisis that policy makers are racing to blunt. A contraction in U.S. economic activity, in turn, would mean global recession.

"The economy is shutting down as it grapples with Covid-19," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com, referring to the disease caused by the virus. "It won't be until the second half of the year, when the virus has presumably passed, that the economy will slowly get back up and running."

The outlook is highly uncertain. Fed officials, who announced an emergency interest rate cut and other measures on Sunday, decided not to update their own forecasts for the remainder of the year. But coming up with a baseline economic outlook is critical as business leaders make decisions about jobs and investment, households manage their budgets and investors reprice assets.

Mr. Zandi sees the economy contracting at a 1.6% annual rate in the first quarter and a 2.5% pace in the second quarter before picking up in the second half of the year and exceeding 3% growth in 2021.

J.P. Morgan is going with similar projections, with the economy contracting at a 2% rate in the first quarter and a 3% rate in the second, and then bouncing back in the second half of the year. Goldman Sachs sees the economy contracting at a 5% annual rate in the second quarter after no growth in the first, and then strong growth in excess of 3% in the second half of the year. Some analysts see an even bigger contraction in the April-June period.

"Our baseline assumption is that activity will start to recover after April and that (the second half) will see strong sequential growth, but the specifics depend on a number of important questions," Goldman said in a note to clients.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday he doesn't believe the U.S. is in a recession, but said, "We're clearly going to have a slowdown."

"If the medical professionals are correct, and we're doing all the things, I expect we'll have a big rebound later in the year," he said on Fox News Sunday.

These factors will determine the contours of the looming downturn: The path for the coronavirus itself, the response of policy makers to support the economy and the resilience of a financial system being strained by the unexpected shock.

China's virus case load flattened in about three months after major government intervention to curtail social interaction, with devastating effects on economic growth. If the U.S. follows the same path, the initial shock to the economy could begin to wane by May. It isn't clear the virus will follow the same timeline; outside of China, it is still growing exponentially, according to tracking by Johns Hopkins University.

The Fed, after cutting short-term interest rates to near zero and launching bond purchases to tame disruptions in the Treasury and mortgage markets, will now be on the watch for market disruptions that new Fed programs might resolve.

Economists said the bond purchases could be critical in the months ahead to shore up the housing sector, a part of the economy that could play a key role in cushioning a downturn by allowing millions of Americans to refinance, and later to spur a recovery by boosting home building and sales.

"It can lead us out of a recession," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. "This is something that we didn't have during the last recession," which was caused by a housing downturn, she added.

Another central question is whether state and federal governments are successful at quickly providing relief to workers affected by the slowdown, particularly millions of hourly workers at restaurants, bars, hotels and other consumer-facing businesses that suddenly face a shutdown.

Congress has approved an $8.3 billion emergency spending package aimed at providing immediate funds for health-care spending, and is considering several more in the weeks ahead as officials grapple with how large a stimulus may be necessary.

A second measure, approved by the House of Representatives on Saturday and headed to the Senate this week, would cover the costs of paid sick leave for many workers affected by the coronavirus and cover the costs of testing. It also provides support to the state unemployment insurance program, which could be a key conduit to getting funds to workers directly affected by the crisis.

Mr. Mnuchin said negotiators are focused next on providing targeted relief to industries hardest-hit by coronavirus disruptions, including airlines, hotels and cruise lines, possibly through a mix of loan guarantees and grants. U.S. airlines have started talks with the government to obtain as much as $50 billion in financial assistance, according to people briefed on the discussions.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Tax Law Curbed A Break Firms Now Need

WASHINGTON -- The 2017 tax law is making life harder for U.S. businesses that suffer sudden losses, and Congress is under pressure to relax some of those provisions as the economy reels from the impact of the coronavirus.

To help pay for cutting the corporate tax rate, the law curtailed deductions for net operating losses and interest. The changes to loss deductions, in particular, make it harder for companies to use today's losses against past profits and claim quick refunds for cash infusions.

The previous tax law "was a classic automatic stabilizer, helping businesses weather an economic storm," said Martin Sullivan, chief economist at Tax Analysts, the nonprofit publisher of Tax Notes. "This is especially important now because businesses, large and small, are seeking liquidity."

Changes to loss deductions and other business tax provisions could come soon as Congress tries to respond to the economic shock of the virus. The National Association of Manufacturers has already asked Congress to consider loosening rules on loss deductions. "Wait and see, Congress is gonna wish they hadn't used net operating loss restrictions to pay for rate cuts," Mr. Sullivan said.

Retailers, restaurants and the travel industry all may experience sudden drops in revenue as consumers avoid spending. Economists and policy makers have been discussing ways to keep companies afloat until the crisis passes.

Rohit Kumar, PwC LLP's tax policy services leader in Washington, said lawmakers may want to consider restoring deductions for losses. "If you relieved that obligation or returned to the old rule, you would get some cash into the system relatively quickly," said Mr. Kumar, a former Senate Republican aide.

So far, coronavirus relief measures passed or under consideration haven't included business tax cuts other than one that helps them pay for newly mandated employee leave.

But more legislation is likely soon, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said airlines, cruise lines and hotels may get help to cope with a sudden collapse in sales.

Before the 2017 tax law, businesses could carry their losses back for up to two years to offset past profits and forward for 20 years as deductions against future profits. They could often seek fast refunds of past year's taxes if they started reporting losses.

"You want some safety valve in the system that allows for liquidity, cash liquidity," said Dan Luchsinger, chair of the tax practice at Covington and Burling LLP. "We're in a world now where there is no quickie refund."

The previous system was a recognition that businesses' fortunes don't necessarily match tax law's annual measurement periods. The deductions effectively allowed businesses to average their income across an entire business cycle.

In the past, including in 2002 and 2009, Congress expanded loss deductions during recessions as a way to get cash to businesses quickly.

But in 2017, with little resistance from corporations, Congress eliminated carrybacks for almost all businesses, meaning that companies can no longer deduct today's losses from yesterday's profits.

Congress also allowed carryforwards to last indefinitely, ending the 20-year limit. And they capped loss deductions used in any year at 80% of a company's taxable income.

As Rates Tumble, Refinancing Boom Swamps Lenders

Record low mortgage rates are delivering more refinancing demand than some lenders can handle.

Homeowners are rushing to refinance their mortgages thanks to big falls in interest rates prompted by fears of the spreading coronavirus. Some lenders are having trouble keeping up with the red-hot demand.

Weekly refinancing applications recently hit their highest level in nearly 11 years, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, the most popular home loan in the U.S., is close to its lowest level in nearly 50 years of record-keeping, hitting 3.36% last week.

Falling rates are generally considered good news for the mortgage market. But the current jump in refinancing demand presents a dilemma for some lenders, which must balance their desire for volume with their capacity to process applications.

Lenders are wary of expanding too quickly in the boom-and-bust mortgage market. What's more, the coronavirus pandemic -- though it helped send mortgage rates down -- could hobble home sales during the important spring selling season. Some would-be sellers are already reluctant to stage open houses, and potential buyers could shy away because they are unsure about their jobs.

Still, many lenders are doing everything they can to increase their ability to take advantage of the current refinancing boom, however long it may last. That includes outsourcing work to other countries and boosting pay for some employees, said Jeff Taylor, managing partner of Digital Risk, a technology and risk firm that consults with mortgage lenders. Underwriters with five years of experience are being offered compensation packages of $130,000, up from about $80,000 in nonpeak times, Mr. Taylor said.

Gordon Miller, president of Miller Lending Group LLC in Cary, N.C., said his firm had to update its website, telling visitors looking for a refinancing quote that someone would get back to them in 48 to 72 hours rather than right away. Mr. Miller also had to change his voice mail, asking callers to leave a number where they could be reached in the evening.

Truist Financial Corp., the sixth-largest U.S. retail bank, said it has seen a major influx in both purchase and refinancing applications. "The industry does not have the capacity to handle it," Chief Executive Kelly King said at an industry conference last week. "Everybody is trying to staff up."

Lenders use the 10-year Treasury yield as a guide for setting mortgage rates, and that has been hitting record lows as investors worried about the impact of the virus pile into government bonds.

But mortgage rates don't move in lockstep with Treasury yields. When demand is strong, lenders can be reluctant to lower prices and crimp their profits, especially if their competitors don't. It is akin to gas stations that lower their rates just enough to stay competitive with rivals.

Some lenders are keeping rates relatively high, a sign that borrowers' strong appetite for refinancings is outpacing the industry's ability to make them. The spread between the 10-year Treasury yield and the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is near its largest since 2009. Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. both advertised rates of 4.375% in some markets last week.

U.S. News: U.S. Tosses A Mueller Russia Court Case

A federal judge dismissed part of special counsel Robert Mueller's case against a Russian firm accused of engaging in a widespread effort to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, after the Justice Department said the company was trying to game the U.S. court process.

In an unusual filing late Monday, prosecutors said the company was taking advantage of the rights it was offered under the American legal system, but not fulfilling its obligations. They asked to dismiss the case against Concord Management & Consulting LLC and a related company, while leaving charges in the same indictment against other defendants intact. U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich granted that request.

The case against Concord, the only one of the Russian firms charged by Mr. Mueller's team that has appeared in court to formally respond to the charges, had been scheduled to go to trial in April.

The litigation has been the subject of repeated drama, as a lawyer for Concord accused Mr. Mueller's team of prosecuting a "made-up crime" and Mr. Mueller's team later said documents that had been provided to Concord confidentially in the context of the litigation wound up online in an apparent effort to discredit the inquiry.

"Although Concord has availed itself of the Court's jurisdiction to obtain discovery from the United States regarding efforts to detect and deter foreign election interference . . . when pressed to comply with its obligations as a party to this litigation, it has refused to do so," prosecutors wrote in the filing.

Concord was indicted in February 2018 alongside two other Russian companies and 13 Russian citizens, and accused of wielding social-media messages, inventing fake personas and staging rallies to sow discord in the U.S. political system.

Concord is run by Yevgeny Prigozhin, who has been known as the Kremlin's favorite restaurateur.

A lawyer for Concord, Eric Dubelier, said the case had "fundamental problems" and "the purpose of this indictment was to make a political statement regarding the outcome of the 2016 election that was grossly overstated."

Stocks Slide Amid Clampdown --- Governments Enforce Stricter Measures To Slow Spread of Infections in U.S., Europe

The Trump administration urged Americans to avoid nonessential travel and large gatherings, in a significant escalation of its recommendations aimed at slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus, as leaders around the world moved to close borders and restrict movement.

As the center of the pandemic shifts to Europe and the U.S., President Trump's administration outlined new guidelines encouraging the public to end discretionary travel and to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people. The guidelines also encourage home schooling, in addition to avoiding bars, restaurants and food courts.

"Each and every one of us has a critical role to play in stopping the spread and transmission of the virus," Mr. Trump said at the White House on Monday.

U.S. stock markets dropped sharply, as fears continue that the measures won't be enough to ward off a recession caused by the pandemic. Economic data from China painted a bleak picture of the impact that government lockdowns have had, with business activity for the first two months of the year turning broadly negative for the first time on record.

Mr. Trump said he wasn't considering a nationwide lockdown and wasn't currently planning domestic travel restrictions.

He said the outbreak could last until July or August.

"It's bad, but we're going to be, hopefully, a best case, not a worst case," he said.

Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, later clarified that the guidelines are part of a 15-day trial and will be reconsidered. "It isn't that these guidelines are now going to be in effect until July," he said. "What the president was saying was that the trajectory of the outbreak may go until then."

Coronavirus deaths outside China surpassed those inside for the first time on Monday. More than 3,800 people from countries including France, Italy and Iran had died from the new coronavirus as of Monday, compared with around 3,200 in China, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Similarly, the 81,000 total cases of infection in China have been surpassed by the 100,000 outside the country. The first cases of coronavirus infection were reported in the central Chinese province of Hubei in December.

After initially being caught off guard by the virus's rapid spread, countries have enacted blanket bans or severe restrictions on visitors and movement, measures that have rattled citizens who are accustomed to an increasingly interconnected world.

Germany partially shut its borders and declared new wide-ranging restrictions on public life. The European Commission proposed an unprecedented 30-day restriction on nonessential travel to the European Union, and Emmanuel Macron of France ordered on Monday a nationwide quarantine, barring people from leaving their homes.

"We are at war," the French president said several times during his address. "All government action must turn towards fighting this epidemic."

Canada said it was closing its borders to most nonresidents, though the ban doesn't apply to trade, commerce or visitors from the U.S. Officials and historians said they don't recall such a blanket ban on foreign visitors entering Canada since World War II. And countries including Singapore, Brunei and Panama have strongly discouraged citizens from leaving except for essential travel.

In South America, Colombia shut its 1,400-mile border with Venezuela, while Chile said it would close its own border with neighbors Peru, Bolivia and Argentina. Peru has closed its land borders, and Ecuador and Argentina said they would do the same.

In the U.S., in a major shift in local response, about 6.7 million people in the Bay Area have been ordered to stay at home for three weeks except for essential needs, officials said Monday.

New Jersey, New York and Connecticut are also instituting a recommended curfew between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m. Other cities, including New York City and Los Angeles, said they would close entertainment venues and limit restaurants and bars to takeout and delivery, but haven't ordered residents to stay home.

The president and his senior advisers stressed that young people can spread the virus even if they have mild symptoms. Ambassador Deborah Birx, special representative for global health diplomacy, said millennials are "the core groups that will stop this virus."

As the virus spreads across the U.S., daily life has become more disrupted as the days go on. More than 4,250 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus have been reported across the country on Monday and at least 74 people have died, according to Johns Hopkins.

Once-bustling streets have quieted as hundreds of schools close, businesses enforce new work from home rules, and more state and local governments enact strong restrictions on large public gatherings, restaurants, bars and entertainment venues. The National Education Association, the largest union in the country, called for all schools to immediately close for at least two weeks.

Washington state, the site of one of the largest outbreaks in the country, said it would close restaurants and bars, except for pickup and delivery, and limit large gatherings to 50 people.

Restrictions are being put in place in the highest offices in the land. The Supreme Court on Monday canceled its March hearing schedule.

The U.S. Senate on Monday began consideration of a House coronavirus response bill that would make testing free and provide paid sick leave to many of those affected by the outbreak, as the first National Institutes of Health-funded novel coronavirus vaccine trial began in Seattle earlier than expected.

The World Health Organization has called on countries to use aggressive measures to limit gatherings and save lives in what it now considers a global pandemic.

The outbreak has now infected more than 181,100 people in 155 countries and territories, according to Johns Hopkins.

Apple Fined By France For Cartel --- Regulator gives the iPhone maker the country's largest antitrust penalty

PARIS -- France's competition authority issued Apple Inc. the country's largest ever antitrust fine against a single company, accusing the maker of iPhones and iPads of orchestrating a distribution cartel with wholesalers that lasted for several years.

The 1.1 billion euro ($1.23 billion) fine, issued Monday after nearly a decade of investigation, came as part of a decision that also found Apple had effectively imposed prices on some retailers and had "abused the economic dependence" of some of its premium resellers in France.

Apple said it strongly disagreed with the decision and would appeal the decision in court.

A spokesman for Apple said: "The French Competition Authority's decision is disheartening. It relates to practices from over a decade ago and discarded 30 years of legal precedent that all companies in France rely on with an order that will cause chaos for companies across all industries."

The fine comes as large technology companies are increasingly in the crosshairs of antitrust officials on both sides of the Atlantic.

In the U.S., federal antitrust enforcers at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, as well as at the state level, have separately trained their sights on Alphabet Inc. unit Google, Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple.

In the European Union, the European Commission, the bloc's top competition authority, has also launched at least preliminary investigations into those companies, on various topics.

Google is seeking to overturn three EU antitrust rulings against it that have totaled more than $9 billion in fines.

Monday's decision stems from a 2012 complaint from a premium retailer of Apple products in France. The competition authority said that between December 2005 and March 2013, Apple had operated a cartel with two electronics wholesalers: Tech Data Corp., based in Clearwater, Fla., and Ingram Micro, now part of China's HNA Group.

"Apple and its two wholesalers agreed not to compete and prevent distributors from competing with each other, sterilizing the wholesale market for Apple products," Isabelle de Silva, president of France's competition authority, said in announcing the decision.

The authority fined those two companies -- 76.1 million euros for Tech Data and 63 million euros for Ingram Micro -- for participating in the arrangement.

Tech Data said it is "determining how we will respond and therefore do not plan to provide additional comment at this time."

Ingram Micro said it would appeal the decision, saying, "These claims [in the decision] are absolutely false."

The French authority also accused Apple of effectively imposing prices on retailers in France between October 2012 and April 2017, saying that Apple would strongly suggest retail prices and then follow retailers' compliance.

The authority said that "created a risk of retaliation -- in the form of non-delivery" for unauthorized promotions.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: A Second Wave of Cases Grips Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong

Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong are witnessing fresh waves of coronavirus infections, as the growing number of cases around the world test their successful early defenses against the disease.

Singapore reported 23 new cases late Tuesday, its highest daily count since the epidemic started. Taiwan recorded a single-day high of 10 cases of infection, bringing its total to 77. Hong Kong added five new cases -- a day after it recorded nine -- the most since Feb. 9.

Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, which were hit early by the fast-spreading coronavirus because of their close economic and social ties with China, have been lauded for effectively controlling initial outbreaks with fast and aggressive responses. Now, they face fresh challenges as coronavirus cases soar in Europe and the Middle East and returning travelers bring back new risks.

"The trouble with this virus is that it is very unpredictable. We do not know who will be at the center of a super-spreading event," said Paul Anantharajah Tambyah, the president of the Asia-Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection. "We are not safe in any place until everyone all over the world is safe."

Globally, cases of infection rose to more than 182,000 on Tuesday and the number of deaths hit 7,155, according to Johns Hopkins University. The fast rise has set off more lockdowns and travel halts.

The Trump administration urged Americans to put off traveling and avoid gatherings of more than 10 people, as infections and deaths outside China exceeded those inside. Its guidance expanded on earlier restrictions that banned most inbound travel from Europe and the U.K.

Millions of people in the San Francisco Bay Area were ordered to remain at home for three weeks and restrictions on bars and restaurants were expanded beyond New York City and Los Angeles to Minnesota and Kentucky.

In addition, Germany unveiled broad restrictions on travel and public life, while France ordered a nationwide quarantine.

The growing tally of infections globally is also forcing new steps in parts of the world that had appeared to have a handle on the virus's spread.

Taiwan reported its first case in early January and moved quickly to enforce quarantine rules on arrivals from China, Hong Kong and Macau. This kept the island's daily new infection counts to single digits for two months -- until the center of the pandemic shifted from Asia. The past three days have brought more than 30% of Taiwan's total cases, most of them involving travelers returning from vacations in places like Europe.

"You can see from the current situation -- compared with the previous wave -- it came much more quickly," Taiwan Minister of Health and Welfare Chen Shih-chung said Monday.

The recent clusters of Taiwanese patients included nine people returning from a vacation in Turkey with the same tour group, provoking a social-media outcry about leisure travel in the wake of the global pandemic.

"If you know a friend who is still traveling for fun, please immediately break up with him -- Right now!" one Twitter user wrote.

On Tuesday, Taiwan extended its self-quarantine rules to cover travelers coming from Washington state, New York and California, as well as Japan and a number of countries in Southeast Asia. Mr. Chen, the island's top health official, strongly advised citizens to avoid unnecessary travel to those places. He said people who knowingly ignore the travel warning won't be eligible for government subsidies during their 14-day quarantines and their names would be made public.

Singapore closed its borders to Chinese travelers on Feb. 1, about a week after China said it would lock down the city of Wuhan, where the first coronavirus infections were reported. It set up a national task force to coordinate its response, ran detailed contact-tracing searches and imposed strict quarantines.

In the past week, after imported cases rose, authorities restricted entry for visitors from many European countries, South Korea and Iran and imposed two-week quarantines for residents and short-term visitors from Southeast Asia. They also strongly discouraged citizens from traveling overseas and recalled exchange students who are studying abroad.

Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said arrivals from all foreign countries would be placed under home quarantine for two weeks beginning Thursday -- extending a quarantine rule that had previously affected travelers from hot spots like China, Iran, Korea and parts of Europe.

"From now on, I would say the majority of arrivals in Hong Kong will be put under home quarantine or medical surveillance of some form," Mrs. Lam said at a press conference on Tuesday.

Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, the disruption and number of cases continued to mount. National Australia Bank, vacated its headquarters in Melbourne after an employee tested positive for the virus. The building will be "pandemically cleansed," NAB Chief Executive Ross McEwan said in a letter to staff posted online Tuesday. Johns Hopkins data show Australia has 377 confirmed cases of infection.

Malaysian Curbs

Spark Panic Buying

News that Malaysia would implement severe international border restrictions until the end of the month led to a wave of panic buying in Singapore's supermarkets.

Singaporeans were seen cleaning out trays of fresh vegetables, poultry and toilet paper within an hour of the announcement, which came late Monday night.

"Everybody is afraid the Malaysian border closures would mean we'll end up with limited fresh vegetables and eggs," said Linus Lim, a 45-year-old Singapore information-technology executive, who stopped by a large supermarket with his two colleagues, hoping to buy some fresh poultry.

They found empty shelves and only one or two packs of chicken.

Trays containing fresh potatoes, broccoli and carrots were bare and shoppers were picking over the last packs of green beans.

Mr. Lim left with ice cream and milk instead.

A store assistant who was manning the poultry counter at the supermarket said the crowd started coming in at 8 a.m. and had cleaned out coolers of fresh pork and chicken by midmorning.

By Tuesday afternoon, the supermarket had started to limit purchases of meat, instant noodles and toilet paper.

The government sent out a statement later Tuesday to try to reassure citizens that Singapore had an adequate supply of food and essentials and the country wouldn't be affected by Malaysia's border shutdown.

U.S. News: Retail Sales Dim, but Steeper Drop Looms

WASHINGTON -- American shoppers reined in their spending last month and factory production was broadly flat, signs the economy began to strain as the threat from the new coronavirus started to take hold.

The Commerce Department's reading on retail sales in February showed they declined by a seasonally adjusted 0.5%, falling well short of expectations and suggesting coronavirus concerns dented consumers' appetite for spending on purchases like vehicles and electronics.

While some of the retail-sales decline was attributable to a drop in gasoline prices, overall weakness suggests consumers began to pull back on spending last month as the coronavirus outbreak spread within U.S. borders.

Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday that manufacturing production edged up 0.1% in February as disruptions at Boeing Co. continued to hold down overall factory output.

Overall industrial production, a measure of factory, mining and utility output, increased a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in February from the prior month, the Federal Reserve said, as utility output rose strongly due to cold weather.

Tuesday's reports encompassed a month in which coronavirus began to spread within the U.S., although the number of cases remained relatively low. Since last month, financial markets have plummeted and consumers have begun to self-isolate amid a widening coronavirus pandemic -- factors that are likely to hit the economy hard in the months ahead.

"With strict measures restraining social activities now in place to contain the coronavirus outbreak, consumer spending is poised for a severe pullback in coming months," Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics said in a note to clients, adding that "disruptions from the coronavirus will bring the economy's main engine to a halt."

Americans reined in spending on dining out, as sales at bars and restaurants dropped 0.5% in February. Sales at clothing, building material, grocery and health stores also dropped. One bright spot was nonstore retailers, a category that includes internet merchants such as Amazon.com Inc., which rose 0.7% as consumers shunned malls and brick-and-mortar stores.

"The March [retail sales] figures are going to be off-the-charts bad, and the April results may not show much of a rebound, depending on how long the more extreme social distancing steps remain in place," Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities, said in a note to clients.

Grocers, drugstores and mass merchants that sell food and household staples such as Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. have said they plan to stay open but many clothing and mall-based chains have announced temporary closures.

Over the weekend, Apple Inc. and Nike, which are big drivers of foot traffic, said they would shut their U.S. stores for two weeks. The list of retail closings has expanded by the day to include chains such as Nordstrom Inc., Foot Locker Inc., Williams Sonoma Inc. and J.Crew Group Inc. Even those that are staying open, such as Kohl's Corp. and J.C. Penney Co., said they would reduce hours this month.

Recreational Equipment Inc. said Sunday that it would close all 162 retail stores for nearly two weeks due to the outbreak, although customers can still shop online.

REI said it would continue to pay store employees during the temporary store closures.

The pandemic is also hitting smaller business operators. Dante Hill, a chef in Austin, Texas, said the cancellation of the South by Southwest festival means "70% of my work for the next two weeks is gone."

"I work with several companies in Austin and this has hit everyone, some to the tune of several hundred thousand dollars," Mr. Hill said.

European governments have pledged hundreds of billions of euros to help economies, companies and workers hit by the coronavirus, applying tools developed during the euro crisis and casting aside strict prohibitions on state subsidies.

The stimulus moves, which come on top of increased government spending automatically triggered during a downturn, could help fiscally sound countries including Germany and the Netherlands to weather the growing economic crisis. But it might not alleviate hardship for weaker countries such as Italy.

That divergence could aggravate an economic gap at the heart of Europe's currency union if it widens the gulf between the region's strong and weak economies, which in the long term could further cloud the single currency's future.

Only a small amount of the total amount pledged so far is stimulus spending that will go directly to business or workers, and most are commitments that may never be drawn on. The amounts are designed both as direct help and toboost confidence among banks, employers and investors.

European Union finance ministers said that already announced fiscal-stimulus plans amounted to 1% of the bloc's output in 2020 and that liquidity support through government guarantees and deferred tax payments was at least 10% of the EU's GDP.

"These figures could be much larger going forward," the ministers said.

At the onset of the financial crisis in late 2008, the EU pumped 200 billion euros ($220 billion) into the economy, around 1.5% of GDP.

France and the Netherlands on Tuesday became the latest countries to open the spigot. France promised 45 billion euros in immediate aid for businesses and employees hit by the coronavirus pandemic, which is slowing or shutting down swaths of the global economy.

French Finance Minister Bruno LeMaire said provisional predictions show the response to the coronavirus will slash 1% from France's gross domestic product this year.

"This economic war will be long-lasting and violent," Mr. LeMaire said on French radio.

The Dutch government announced a raft of measures to support companies, ranging from tax exemptions to having up to 90% of wages paid by the government. The measures are expected to cost 10 billion euros to 20 billion euros over the next three months, but that sum could increase, said Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra.

The move followed the crisis response measures of Germany, Europe's biggest economy and so far the country that has pledged the greatest action. Government officials said last week they would provide potentially unlimited government financing for disrupted businesses, including measures that helped Germany emerge from the financial crisis a decade ago largely unscathed.

Central to Berlin's plan is a 550 billion euro loan and loan-guarantee program for businesses of all sizes, though the government stressed that it has no limit on financial support.

But Italy and Spain, two nations currently hit hardest by the virus, have been more cautious. Italy's government announced a 25 billion euro spending plan on Monday that included additional funds for health care, and provisions to suspend tax payments and provide mortgage relief to affected businesses and households. Spain on Tuesday announced up to 200 billion euros in support, including private funds the government hopes to mobilize. Only 17 billion euros of the total would be direct support.

Britain's Better Stimulus

The economic war Prime Minister Boris Johnson wanted to fight was for Britain's prosperity after Brexit. The war he has instead is against the damage wrought by Covid-19. His Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, fired the first broadside Tuesday with a major raft of supply-side measures.

The centerpiece is a loan-guarantee program worth GBP 330 billion, or around 15% of gross domestic product, for businesses of all sizes. Larger firms will be able to tap the central bank directly, while smaller companies will access the facility through their banks. That GBP 330 billion is only the start. Chancellor Whatever-It-Takes (Mr. Sunak used that phrase six times in his brief prepared remarks) promises to expand the guarantees to match demand.

Mr. Sunak also is offering hospitality businesses a holiday on payment of the tax on business premises, and all small companies will be eligible for one-off grants ranging from GBP 10,000 to GBP 25,000. Coupled with other measures announced in last week's budget, direct support will be worth GBP 32 billion, or 1.6% of GDP. Add to that a modest demand-side stimulus, including a previously announced GBP 1 billion welfare expansion and moral suasion on mortgage lenders to offer three-month repayment holidays to affected workers.

In proportion to GDP, these measures are larger than other national governments have attempted so far. Crucially, they're targeted at the supply side of the economy. Mr. Sunak recognizes that a Keynesian demand stimulus won't work if a quarantined population can't get to the stores. The goal instead has to be to tide otherwise viable companies over a once-in-a-century health emergency without allowing a wave of business closures or defaults to trigger a financial crisis and recession.

Other governments, including the U.S., are likely to take a different approach. They couldn't resist in 2009, with baleful consequences for economic growth. We hope Messrs. Johnson and Sunak don't lose their supply-side nerve as the economic panic deepens.

For now Mr. Sunak is right that demand-side stimulus won't help the British economy if consumers are quarantined for a prolonged period. His supply-side alternatives provide a timelier response, with the public able to judge the results soon enough.

JPMorgan Probed on Treasurys --- Government expands campaign against spoofing beyond derivatives

WASHINGTON -- Authorities are investigating whether traders at JPMorgan Chase & Co. manipulated the market for Treasury securities and futures contracts, according to regulatory disclosures and people familiar with the matter.

The investigation shows that federal prosecutors and regulators continue to expand a campaign against an illicit practice known as spoofing, which has mainly focused on wily trading in derivatives. A move to scrutinize whether similar practices have affected the $17 trillion market for Treasury securities would open a new, and potentially more complicated, front in the war on spoofing.

The bank disclosed in a Feb. 25 regulatory filing that it is dealing with "related requests concerning similar trading-practices issues in markets for other financial instruments, such as U.S. Treasurys." According to people familiar with the matter, the investigation also is probing the bank's trading in futures. It couldn't be learned which time period authorities are focusing their investigation on.

The Justice Department's Fraud Section and regulators at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are involved, the people said. A spokeswoman for JPMorgan declined to comment. A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment.

Regulators and other authorities cracked down on spoofing after Congress specifically outlawed the feinting strategy in 2010. Citigroup Inc. paid $25 million in 2017 to settle regulatory claims that five traders spoofed Treasury futures. The same year, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. paid $600,000 to resolve CFTC claims over similar misconduct.

Prosecutors' record against individual traders is mixed, however. The Justice Department has prevailed in one trial that alleged spoofing violations, but lost two others.

Spoofers typically send large orders to futures exchanges intended to change the appearance of supply and demand. If prices move in response, the spoofers may succeed at their goal -- getting a smaller order filled. They then cancel the larger order as quickly as possible. The 2010 law forbade the practice of sending misleading orders that traders don't intend to have executed.

Prosecutors and regulators have relied on detecting such trading patterns in data they obtain from futures-exchange owner CME Group Inc. Trading in Treasury securities has similarly moved to electronic venues -- one owned by CME -- although trading remains more dispersed than in futures, said James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University.

Unlike futures, which the CFTC oversees, no single regulator monitors trading in Treasury securities, which is considered the world's deepest and most-liquid bond market. Almost 75% of the $623 billion in average daily volume in February was traded electronically, according to Greenwich Associates research.

A move to examine trading practices in Treasury securities would be a big step in a market that has historically had little transparency, said Kevin McPartland, head of market structure and technology research at Greenwich.

"The CFTC has oversight of the futures market, full stop," Mr. McPartland said, "whereas the government has always taken a light touch to the markets for trading its own debt."

The CFTC's spoofing law doesn't apply to trading in Treasury securities, which is covered by different antifraud laws enforced by the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission. While the CFTC has brought enforcement cases against banks over spoofing in Treasury futures, only the DOJ and SEC can police the trading of Treasury bonds, bills and notes.

Some traders say it is likely harder to manipulate secondary-market prices in U.S. Treasurys, because order sizes on the electronic networks, which serve banks and the largest proprietary trading firms, are larger than in stocks and futures.

"It is going to be a lot harder for the government to catch spoofers in the cash Treasury market than in the futures market," Mr. Angel said.

A Tax-Delay Boost

Lawmakers are wrangling over how best to help Americans hit by the virus shutdown, but credit to the Trump Administration for moving decisively on one helpful idea. Its decision to delay IRS filing and payment deadlines to July 15 will be a boon to struggling Americans and an economy in need of liquidity.

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Tuesday announced the IRS will allow individuals who owe $1 million or less in taxes an additional 90 days beyond April 15 to pay their bill. This high threshold is designed to open the relief to many "pass through" businesses that employ workers but file taxes through the individual code. The delay will also apply to corporations owing less than $10 million in taxes. And the IRS will waive interest and penalties.

The tax agency as of March 6 had received about 68 million individual tax returns -- or fewer than half of what it expects to see filed. Most early filers are those who knew they were due a refund, and Treasury is encouraging other Americans in that situation to file by April 15 and get their money as soon as possible.

Later filers tend to be those who know they owe the tax man, so this extension will allow tens of millions of individuals a much-needed bridge loan, even as it helps businesses struggling with cash flow. Mr. Mnuchin estimates the delay will keep as much as $300 billion in the economy for now. Treasury may have to engage in some near-term borrowing, but the feds are in a position to easily tap that money -- unlike most average Joes.

The practical virtue of the IRS move is that it allows filers in need of a financial cushion the choice of exercising a tax delay. That's in contrast to plans for government to dump dollars on individuals or industries willy-nilly. It's the model to bear in mind as Washington decides what to do next.

U.S. News: In a Twist, Asbestos Suit Targets College

PITTSBURGH -- Peter Labosky Jr. had been retired for 12 years from his job as a professor of wood sciences at Pennsylvania State University when he was diagnosed in 2014 with mesothelioma. He died five months later.

Mr. Labosky's family alleges in a lawsuit filed in 2016 that the university negligently exposed him to asbestos dust after failing to clean it up in buildings where he taught. The case is working its way through state court in Pittsburgh.

The lawsuit is proceeding amid louder calls to clean up asbestos and halt its use nationally. It appears to be the first of its kind brought against a university, creating a new path for asbestos litigation, said legal experts. It could open the door to similar suits in Pennsylvania, and raise awareness about potential exposures at universities in other states.

"This could raise a lot of concern by employers with regard to the facilities they provide to their workers which may contain asbestos products," said Lester Brickman, an emeritus professor at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York who has written extensively on asbestos litigation.

Penn State defends its handling of asbestos as proactive and careful, and doesn't comment on pending litigation, said Lisa Powers, a spokeswoman for the university.

Asbestos was widely used from the 1940s to the 1980s and is still in hundreds of thousands of buildings, including schools, across the country. Asbestos was banned from most building materials in the 1980s, but older buildings, including schools, typically contain ceilings, floor tiles, pipe insulation and other materials with asbestos used for its fireproof and acoustic qualities.

Last year, 18 state attorneys general asked Congress to prevent all uses of the material. A bill in the House would ban the manufacture and distribution of asbestos.

In Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf in January proposed spending more than $1 billion to remove asbestos and lead in schools. The School District of Philadelphia said it has 175 buildings with asbestos, and it has closed nine since September due to health concerns.

"Asbestos can be contained and managed on-site," said Claire Barnett, executive director of Healthy Schools Network, which advocates for removing environmental hazards in schools. But if maintenance is poor, moisture can cause asbestos to crumble, exposing its deadly dust, she said. "It happens everywhere."

An estimated 40,000 people die in the U.S. from asbestos-related diseases each year, including mesothelioma, a cancer of the linings of the lungs or stomach that can develop 30 years or more after exposure.

Asbestos litigation, which has been moving through court dockets for years, has to date largely targeted product manufacturers. Workplace injuries are usually handled through workers' compensation claims, but people who develop asbestos-related diseases years after retiring are often beyond the deadline for filing such a claim against an employer.

A 2013 court ruling in Pennsylvania allowed people who develop an asbestos-related disease to sue an employer for negligence outside of the workers' compensation act and made the suit against Penn State and other potential cases possible.

Universities typically monitor asbestos, as required by federal and state regulations, and remove it during renovations. Penn State found in the 1970s that close to 100 buildings contained asbestos, according to court documents. By 1984, the school had spent over $500,000 removing asbestos.

During the 1980s the cost of removing asbestos at the university rose fivefold, according to court documents. In 1989, a Penn State official stated in a memorandum that the school would no longer remove asbestos when it was encountered.

"In all future projects, our goal should be to minimize the removal of asbestos to only what is absolutely required," the official wrote. "Obviously, this will help us a lot in the area of project budgets."

Michael Robb, a Pittsburgh attorney representing the Labosky family, alleges that the university scaled back its asbestos removal to cut costs while it knew about health risks.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Plans in Works to Help Pay the Bills

Behind a flurry of activity in Washington on Tuesday was an increasingly urgent problem for a nation grappling with the novel coronavirus pandemic: The growing risk that millions of businesses and households won't be able to pay their everyday bills -- rent, payroll, utilities -- as business activity grinds to an unprecedented halt.

The Federal Reserve launched a program to provide short-term loans to businesses in commercial-paper markets, while White House officials and lawmakers scrambled for ideas to get funds into the private sector, and the Treasury postponed one of the biggest bills coming due for anyone: individual income taxes.

In a normally functioning economy, paychecks and revenues roll in for workers and their employers, and they use a good chunk of that money to pay the bills they have coming due. In the business world, it's called working capital.

Now as restaurants close, airlines stop flying and streets go empty, businesses and households have a similar and pressing problem: The money just isn't coming in, but bills still have to get paid.

The financial system typically serves as a backstop. Businesses use credit lines to alleviate short-term funding squeezes. A household might draw from savings or tap a home-equity line.

But those systems are becoming overloaded. It's an especially pressing problem for millions of low- and middle-income households. Nearly 4 in 10 Americans don't have the savings in hand to cover an unexpected, $400 expense with cash, according to Fed surveys.

Fed data shown on financial businesses had $1.53 in liquid assets like cash and securities on hand for every $1 in short-term liabilities in the fourth quarter. That is down from $1.80 when Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, but up from $1.34 during the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, according to Moody's Analytics. The more liquid assets they hold, the better positioned they are to handle a cash crunch.

The Fed took additional steps to address the problem Tuesday, throwing a rescue line to commercial paper markets, where banks, money market mutual funds and others provide short-term loans of a few days, weeks or months directly to businesses.

The Fed will provide funds to financial firms for up to three months and take their commercial paper as collateral. The central bank hopes that with a place to park their commercial paper, lenders will make more of it available in markets. The program will be backstopped by the U.S. Treasury to cushion losses the Fed might take in the process.

A pressing question is whether Congress and the White House can fill that void.

"We desperately need . . . a dedicated pool of money that is available to step in and salvage viable companies that are struggling," Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at money-manager Guggenheim Partners LLC, said Tuesday. A global depression is possible "if policy makers don't act quickly," he said.

Some ideas -- such as a broad payroll tax cut -- might not deliver funds quickly enough or directly to the people in most dire need to hold off the impending cash crunch. For the moment, the White House and a growing number of lawmakers seemed to be turning to more immediate measures.

For starters, the Internal Revenue Service will postpone the April 15 tax-payment deadline. The Trump administration also said it backs a plan to send checks directly to Americans.

Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) on Monday backed giving each American adult $1,000.

Among Democrats, Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Michael Bennet of Colorado and Sherrod Brown of Ohio propose sending $2,000 to every adult and child below a set income, with future payments in July and then quarterly, until unemployment levels drop after an expected rise.

Last week, Reps. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.) and Tim Ryan (D., Ohio) proposed sending a check between $1,000 and $6,000 to every American who earned less than $65,000 last year.

"To me, this is about cash," Mr. Ryan said.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: IRS Extends April 15 Deadline for Payments

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. government will postpone the April 15 tax-payment deadline for millions of individuals, giving Americans an additional 90 days to pay their 2019 income-tax bills in an unprecedented move intended to ease the economic pain inflicted by the coronavirus.

The IRS, using authority under President Trump's national-emergency declaration, will waive interest and penalties as well, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday. The delay is available to people who owe $1 million or less and corporations that owe $10 million or less, he said.

Mr. Mnuchin said the move could provide $300 billion in temporary liquidity, giving households and businesses a financial cushion as they cope with the sudden slowdown in economic activity caused by the coronavirus epidemic.

"We are going to use all the tools we have," Mr. Mnuchin said. "And what tools we don't have, we're going to go to Congress."

The IRS will continue to process tax refunds. Taxpayers should file their returns as usual by April 15 but they can defer payment for up to 90 days beyond that, according to the Senate Finance Committee. Presumably, they can also seek six-month extensions and defer payment, but the IRS hasn't made that clear yet.

Tax preparers warned that requiring taxpayers to file returns or requests for extensions by April 15 would create unnecessary work and stress over the next month as people try to complete returns or extensions.

"Had they not decoupled the payment date from the due date, and just blanket extended everything to July 15, we as tax preparers and employers, and just plain old citizens, could ratchet back the amount of time we spend together daily and weekly," said Ken Goodrow, an accountant at Tyler, Simms & St. Sauveur in Lebanon, N.H.

"Unless this return due date moves we are all in for a much busier, much more stressful month than normal," he said.

The IRS hasn't explained whether taxpayers can also defer estimated-tax payments for the first quarter of 2020, which are also due on April 15.

Banking & Finance: Market Recess Suggested --- Money managers talk of two-week shutdown in call with new Bank of England governor

Executives from some of the biggest asset managers told the Bank of England's new governor on Monday that financial markets should close for two weeks as the world confronts the coronavirus pandemic, people familiar with the matter said.

Speaking on a conference call with Bank of England Gov. Andrew Bailey, several executives raised the possibility of a shutdown during a wide-ranging discussion on the state of the markets and the financial-services industry. A majority of those on the call, though, said they didn't think shuttering the markets would help address the deepening crisis, the people said.

Mr. Bailey, who began his term as governor on Monday, held the call with senior executives from some of the world's biggest asset managers, including Vanguard Group, BlackRock Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp., people familiar with the matter said.

It couldn't be learned which asset manager executives wanted to close the markets and which didn't.

Steven Mnuchin, the U.S. Treasury secretary, said Tuesday that the White House plans to keep financial markets open, though "we may get to a point where we shorten the hours." He said he had discussed the markets with bank executives and officials at the New York Stock Exchange, and "everybody wants to keep it open."

The NYSE and other U.S. stock markets closed in 2012 as the East Coast contended with superstorm Sandy, and in the aftermath of the September 2001 terrorist attacks.

On the call with Mr. Bailey, the executives delivered a grim assessment of the credit markets and urged the central bank to take additional steps to support the banking system as it confronts the fallout from the pandemic.

Many riskier securities, including junk bonds and emerging-market debts, were now near impossible to trade, they said. They recommended steps that would make it easier for companies and other issuers to refinance their debts.

U.S. stocks fell sharply on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting its second-worst day in the benchmark's history. Trading was halted for 15 minutes shortly after the opening bell, marking the third time in six sessions that a selloff had triggered the marketwide circuit-breaker. On Tuesday, the benchmark stock indexes regained some of those declines.

The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 0.870%, from 0.722% Monday. The U.S. government bond market has been unusually volatile in recent days, reflecting investors' growing anxiety as well as the liquidity constraints surfacing in various corners of the market amid the broader rout.

Spreads on corporate bonds, or the extra yield investors demand over Treasurys, has been increasing at an unprecedented speed, Morgan Stanley analysts said.

On Monday's call with the asset management executives, Mr. Bailey acknowledged the need for central banks to address the markets' liquidity needs and the challenges posed by traders working from home as governments seek to contain the virus's spread, people familiar with the matter said.

Working outside their trading floors had further diminished the banks' appetite for taking on risk, the executives said.

The Federal Reserve said Sunday it had adjusted a program with other central banks, including the Bank of England, to make U.S. dollars available overseas at near-zero interest rates.

On Monday, the Fed unleashed a series of additional moves to stabilize markets, slashing the benchmark interest rate to near zero and agreeing to buy $700 billion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. And on Tuesday, the Fed said it would establish a lending facility to help support short-term commercial debt.

On Monday's conference call, the executives told Mr. Bailey that most mutual funds weren't yet facing a stampede of outflows from either big institutional clients or individual investors, and the continuing stability of those assets under management was critical to their industry's health.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Devout Iranians Defy Tehran's Call to Avoid Shrines

TEHRAN -- Iranian worshipers have attempted to break into holy shrines and mosques, defying Iran's leaders who are trying to bar access to religious sites as they struggle to stem a soaring death rate caused by the new coronavirus.

Police in the central city of Qom on Tuesday apprehended 11 rioters who the night before clashed with mosque guards as they tried to enter one of Iran's holiest sites, the Masoumeh shrine, the Qom prosecutor told state television. The same night in the city of Mashhad, worshipers tried to enter the largest religious site in the country, the Imam Reza shrine. The shrine remained shut on Tuesday.

President Hassan Rouhani is trying to balance demands from some Iranians for mass quarantines with pushback from those who oppose restrictions on religious and economic activities. The tension comes as some experts warn that fatalities in Iran from Covid-19 could reach into the millions if public disregard for official guidelines continues.

The acts of the worshipers in Qom went against not just the central government, but also against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has urged all Iranians to follow the measures introduced by the Health Ministry.

Mr. Khamenei last week said medical personnel who die after contracting the coronavirus should be considered martyrs, a title usually reserved for those who perish in war. On Tuesday, the supreme leader issued a religious ruling prohibiting unnecessary travel during the outbreak.

Iran is battling one of the world's worst outbreaks of Covid-19. The Health Ministry on Tuesday logged 135 deaths over the previous 24 hours, bringing the number of fatalities to 988. More than 16,000 people have been infected from the illness caused by the new coronavirus in Iran.

Some are warning that Iran's death toll will continue to soar -- and just how high will depend on compliance with public-health advice.

In a new study, cited by Iranian state media, researchers at the renowned Sharif University of Technology in Tehran said if the Iranian population begins fully cooperating with advice from authorities now, the outbreak will peak in early April, leading to an estimated 12,000 deaths. If they refuse to cooperate, Iran's strained medical system will be overwhelmed, and the peak will occur in June, causing as many as 3.5 million people to die, the study said.

Iran isn't alone in attempting to stem the tide of worshipers to holy sites -- and containing the risks such mass congregations pose in spreading the virus.

On Tuesday, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the paramount spiritual authority in Iraq, who also commands loyalty among millions of Shiites across the world, issued a religious edict designating the fight against the coronavirus a collective duty.

Mr. Sistani likened the work of medical workers to that of "heroic fighters" and said those who fell in the line of duty should be considered martyrs. Both the Shiite and Sunni authorities have instructed all mosques under their authority across Iraq to be closed.

Saudi Arabia also on Tuesday suspended all mass prayers, including Friday prayer, in all mosques, with the exception of the two holy mosques in Mecca and Medina, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.

In Iran, authorities on Monday closed four important religious sites after weekslong calls to shut shrines and mosques to avoid mass gatherings. The Masoumeh shrine in Qom and the Imam Reza Mosque in the eastern city of Mashhad are two of the country's holiest sites. Authorities also closed the Shah-Abdol Azim shrine in Tehran and the Jamkaran Mosque in Qom.

While Iranian authorities say Qom is the source of its Covid-19 epidemic, they hadn't until Monday restricted travel or closed religious sites in the city, although local authorities had banned hotels and guest houses from taking travelers.

The Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad attracts up to 25 million Iranian and non-Iranian pilgrims a year. The Astan Quds Razavi, which runs the shrine, is one of Iran's wealthiest and most politically powerful foundations.

Some Iranian conservatives have for decades resisted government interference in religious practices. A video circulated on social media showed a worshiper on Monday outside the Masoumeh shrine in Qom accusing Iran's Ministry of Health of obeying orders from the World Health Organization, which he said didn't believe in religion.

"If you are a true believer, this door must be opened tonight," the instigator said, adding that for 1,400 years no Iranian ruler had managed to shut the shrine.

Iranian politicians criticized attempts to breach the shrines. Prominent reformist Mostafa Tajzadeh called the rioters an irresponsible minority, while lawmaker Ali Motahhari said they should be prosecuted for spreading the virus and defaming Islam.

The Iranian government has urged people to minimize travel around the country and those with symptoms to stay home, but it has refrained from imposing quarantines, even during the two-week Persian New Year, which begins March 20.

Iranian police on Monday banned the annual fire festival, slated for Tuesday, which is part of the New Year celebrations, but police chief Hossein Ashtari blamed "enemies" of Iran for spreading rumors about a quarantine with the aim of causing panic buying and a shortage of essential goods.

The government's opposition to lockdown measures stems partly from fears over the potential damage to a fragile economy, which has been the source of recent unrest. As U.S. sanctions have hammered Iran's economy, domestic tourism -- particularly to religious sites -- has provided a lifeline.

Cities, states and Washington sought ways to mitigate the blow of the coronavirus as businesses closed, the European Union planned to shut its borders and fears of a pandemic-induced recession kept markets on edge.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is pitching Senate Republicans on a $1 trillion stimulus plan that would include roughly $250 billion in direct payments, according to a White House official. The Federal Reserve also took steps to prevent further strains in short-term commercial debt markets. The moves helped push U.S. stocks higher Tuesday following a punishing selloff a day earlier.

Around the country, disruptions to daily life continued unabated. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he was considering a shelter-in-place order requiring residents to stay at home for a period, while officials in Hoboken, N.J., ordered residents to self-isolate. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott activated the state's National Guard as the number of infections there grew and the state reported its first coronavirus-related death. More states, including North Carolina, added restrictions on bars and restaurants.

States including Ohio and Maryland delayed their primary elections. Florida, Illinois and Arizona forged ahead with their contests, but last-minute changes to polling locations caused confusion among some voters.

The coronavirus has now officially spread throughout the entire nation, as West Virginia on Tuesday became the 50th state to disclose it has a confirmed case.

Efforts to slow the virus's impact and spread across the U.S. followed more drastic moves in Europe, where France and other countries pledged billions of euros in immediate aid for businesses and employees hit by the pandemic.

Confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus rose globally to more than 196,600 on Tuesday as the death toll hit 7,893, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

Among the new cases were four players on the NBA's Brooklyn Nets, according to the team. Star player Kevin Durant told The Athletic he was one of them.

The swift increase has set off more lockdowns and travel halts.

The EU said it would close its borders for 30 days -- an unprecedented move. The travel ban will allow exemptions for citizens and long-term residents or their immediate families returning home; medical staff and others dealing with the coronavirus; diplomats, frontier workers and people transporting goods. The U.K. and Ireland, which share a common travel zone, aren't covered by the measures.

A nationwide lockdown in France took effect Tuesday, following Italy and Spain, where confirmed cases hit 31,506 and 11,309, respectively, Tuesday. Governments in Asia, meanwhile, are limiting visitors from foreign countries as travelers bring a second wave of the new coronavirus to the region.

The United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees, which coordinates refugee flights around the world, said it was pausing all resettlement flights within the next couple of days. The pause will likely mean the U.S. -- which is accepting a record low 18,000 refugees this year -- could end up resettling even fewer people than it had planned.

Infections in the U.S. surpassed 5,850 Tuesday, with at least 97 deaths. The number of cases is expected to increase as testing capabilities expand.

The U.S. military said Tuesday it would open its labs, ready its hospital ships and distribute key medical equipment in response to the growing crisis. The Trump administration announced new steps to increase access to telehealth, allowing patients to reach doctors remotely for care.

In San Francisco, where a legally mandated lockdown went into effect Tuesday, police patrols were light. But citizens mostly appeared to be complying with the edict, which says residents may venture outside only for groceries or medical appointments. Walks and other exercise are also allowed, but not in groups.

When Cathy Bayer left her home in the city's Miraloma Park neighborhood to stock up on groceries, she said she expected to see some form of police presence.

"I was worried if I would be stopped driving down the street, but so far I don't really see anything different," Ms. Bayer, a 64-year-old administrator, said as she loaded three bags of groceries into her car.

Notably outdoors were San Francisco's large homeless population, which city officials exempted from the order.

Manufacturers in the U.S. are improvising to keep factories humming as the coronavirus pandemic threatens one of the biggest disruptions in memory to supply chains, staffing and demand. Amazon.com Inc. said it is taking steps to prioritize shipments of medical supplies, household staples and other high-demand products.

Marriott International Inc., the world's largest hotel company, said it is starting to furlough what it expects will be tens of thousands of employees as it ramps up hotel closings. Meanwhile, retailers including Macy's, Foot Locker, Ralph Lauren, Chico's, American Eagle Outfitters and Fossil announced plans to close stores in the U.S. temporarily.

Governments around the globe are enacting more aggressive measures amid fears of the pandemic's spreading economic impact.

France, where the number of confirmed cases rose to more than 7,600, pledged 45 billion euros ($50 billion) in immediate aid for businesses and employees hit by the pandemic. The U.K., Germany and other European countries have also announced assistance measures for businesses.

In Iran, site of the third-worst outbreak in the world behind China and Italy, worshipers defied restrictions on access to holy shrines and mosques, as the country's leaders struggle to stem soaring infection and death rates.
