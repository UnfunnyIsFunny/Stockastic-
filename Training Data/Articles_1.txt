Nowhere other than in China is the coronavirus epidemic more severe than in Iran, where authorities confirmed Sunday that at least 54 people, including an 81-year-old former ambassador, have died from Covid-19. The real death toll may be considerably higher than that; on Friday, BBC Persian tallied 210 deaths from individual hospitals. Seven prominent officials have contracted the disease, including Vice President Masoumeh Ebtekar, who in her youth served as a spokesman for U.S. Embassy hostage-takers. Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi broke out in a sweat Feb. 24 as he assured the public that the epidemic was under control; the following day he announced he was sick.

President Hassan Rouhani has lamely insisted the epidemic is "one of the enemy's plots." His government, meanwhile, has inspired unprecedented apathy. Turnout in February's parliamentary elections was the lowest in the Islamic republic's history: 43% nationally and 25% in Tehran.

These are symptoms of a broader malaise. The world-wide material and human progress of the past few decades has largely left Iran behind, despite conditions that should encourage success. It sits at the crossroads of Eurasia and has a highly educated population of 85 million. Perhaps the greatest cultural, economic and geopolitical tragedy of our time is the near-absence of the Iranian nation in a world perfectly suited for its human potential.

History often moves on a hinge, and there were many hinges in the late 1970s. Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi suffered from lymphatic cancer: that, and his prednisone regimen, adversely affected his judgment and decisiveness. President Jimmy Carter was prone to vacillating and misread the intentions of the Iranian clerical movement. Iraqi Vice President Saddam Hussein expelled the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini from the Shiite holy city of Najaf, forcing Khomeini into exile in the Paris suburb of Neauphle-le-Chateau. There he sat cross-legged beneath an apple tree, rallied his followers, and methodically seduced the world media.

If these hinges had not worked together as they did, Iran today might look like South Korea -- a vibrant, pulsing economic engine at the forefront of globalization. The Pahlavis might have gradually been reduced from absolute rulers to constitutional monarchs. Instead, Iran went backward politically, while barely crawling forward economically.

In 1977 Iran's economy was 26% larger than Turkey's, 65% larger than South Korea's, and almost 5.5 times the size of Vietnam's -- all countries with somewhat larger populations. In 2017 on the eve of the Trump administration's sanctions, Turkey's economy was nearly 2.5 times the size of Iran's, South Korea's more than seven times, and Vietnam's had gone from less than 20% to 70%, according to Nadereh Chamlou, a former World Bank official. While poverty has declined in Iran, 40% of the population earns less than $10 a day, which the bank classifies as "near poverty."

What went wrong? "Domestic policies to promote entrepreneurship could have helped to capitalize on Iran's young and educated population," Ms. Chamlou concludes. "A foreign policy geared to regional and global integration could have permitted Iran to benefit much more from its unique economic geography."

Imagine the geopolitical clout a stable Iranian constitutional monarchy would have today. Iran would enjoy strategic cooperation with Israel and stable, nonconfrontational relations with Saudi Arabia and the Sunni Arab world. Iran is economically, culturally and demographically suited to be at the crossroads of Central Asia: Only its relative backwardness and extreme religiosity prevent the secular, vodka-drinking leaders of former Soviet republics from being more attracted to it.

Instead, Iran is a pauperized and lonely nation. Its only allies in the Greater Middle East are the murderous proxy militias it supports and Bashar Assad's regime in Syria. Arab states like Egypt and Saudi Arabia, not Iran, now have de facto security relationships with Israel, though the Persians have had better relations with the Jews for millennia.

At the same time, the clerical regime has worked to obscure the memory of historic Persia, which preceded Islam by more than a thousand years, reducing a rich civilization to a bleak lumpen proletariat. Theocracy has promoted cynicism about religion. Mosque attendance has been down for years. As the French political scientist Olivier Roy puts it, "the political victory of Islamism is the end of true devotion." Instead, crowds gather in Shiraz at the tomb of Hafez, the 14th-century poet of wine and romance. Many an Iranian bookshelf holds a volume of his sensuous verse, a quiet symbol of defiance against the Islamic authorities.

In the Islamic Revolution, one bureaucratic power structure -- that of the shah -- quickly gave way to another, that of the clerics. In this and other ways, the Islamic Revolution was far more sophisticated than the formless, leaderless uprisings of the 2011 Arab Spring. But Iran is in the decadent phase of its revolution. Like the Soviet Union under Leonid Brezhnev, the regime seems stable yet is widely seen as illegitimate by the population, and thus is in danger of unraveling -- perhaps with disastrous aftershocks.

The Soviet collapse under Mikhail Gorbachev led to social and economic upheaval, with violent ethnic conflicts on the Russian imperial periphery and the eventual re-establishment of dictatorship under Vladimir Putin. Iran, like late-Soviet Russia, has a deeply corroded political culture. Prompt establishment of constitutional order may be too much to hope for.

A regime collapse could give way to even more tyrannical rule by the Revolutionary Guards, and to uprisings in the Kurdish, Azeri, Turkman and Baluchi peripheries. Apart from the Revolutionary Guards, there would be no pre-existing bureaucratic power structure to replace the clerical one. Civil society has been decimated for decades. It's not clear if any faction would have complete control of Iran's formidable missile arsenal, which may extend to sites in Iraq and Syria.

The Trump administration is trying to bring Iran to its knees, but it needs to focus on what will come afterward. With a declining economy, a raging coronavirus epidemic, and an aged and ailing supreme leader, Iran in the coming years promises to be more interesting -- and more dangerous -- than at any time in recent memory.

Shoppers Adjust to Plastic-Bag Ban

A new ban on single-use plastic bags took effect Sunday in New York City, amid some confusion and grumbling.

Many shoppers dug out colorful canvas and nylon totes that have accumulated at home for years, backpacks and gym bags and dragged them to supermarkets for the first day of shopping under the new law.

But some large stores and small bodegas weren't ready. On Friday, the day a lawsuit was filed challenging the new law, New York state agreed to delay enforcement of the ban on plastic bags until April 1. The suit was brought by an association of bodega owners and a plastic-bag manufacturer.

The plastic-bag ban is statewide; some localities, including New York City, also introduced a 5-cent fee for each paper bag sold, to encourage customers to switch to reusable bags. After the court hearing, a spokesman for the New York state Department of Environmental Conservation said the state had always planned a period of education before issuing summonses.

The department estimates New York state residents use 23 billion plastic bags a year.

Mike Rosenberg, a pediatrician who lives in Riverdale in the Bronx, was armed with shopping bags and ready for the new ban Sunday. But when he arrived at Fairway Market in West Harlem, he found to his surprise that plastic bags were still available at every checkout counter.

Dr. Rosenberg said he was a long supporter of the ban -- in theory. In practice, he hadn't regularly brought reusable bags with him on shopping trips, as his wife did.

"I have been guilty of using plastic," he said. "The ban has been a long time coming. It should have been done a long time ago."

At Fairway, the manager on duty said the grocery store planned to switch over when it used up its backlog of plastic bags, probably by Monday. He said some other Fairway Markets had already made the switch. Reusable shopping bags were available for purchase.

At a Dominican bodega, Super Value Meat Market, on West 141st Street and Broadway, aluminum racks at the cashier's counter still held thick wads of plastic bags. Pedro Guzman, who runs the grocery, said he was aware of the bodega-industry lawsuit and plans to comply with the government rules within the next few weeks.

He said he remembers life before the proliferation of plastic bags in the 1980s. "Everyone used paper bags," he said. The bodega will offer durable shopping bags for 79 cents and provide them free to regular customers.

Nery Morales arrived at Food Universe Marketplace, on West 138th Street and Broadway, with a prized Hershey's shopping bag that once carried a gift from her son. That bag was in turn filled with other shopping bags.

"We have no more plastic bags," said Frank Beras, the manager. "The people understand."

Grocery stores and delis can still offer plastic bags for unpackaged produce and prepared foods. But they won't be available at the checkout line, and customers will have to use either paper, reusable bags or totes.

At one liquor store on Broadway, a clerk said that for now the store had only single-bottle size paper bags available for 5 cents each, and customers would have to provide their own shopping bags for larger purchases.

U.S. News --- THE OUTLOOK: Immigration Drives Canada's Growth

Canada largely avoided the doldrums that afflicted other advanced economies last year amid a global slowdown. Immigration is a big reason why.

Economic growth over the long term generally has two sources: an expanding workforce and advances in productivity, or output per hour worked. When more people are employed, they produce more goods and provide more services, earn more and spend more, creating demand for more workers.

Canada owes its relatively solid pace of economic growth in recent years to gains in the labor force rather than productivity, which has stagnated.

Canada's labor force grew 2% last year according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, faster than the U.S. and Japan, the only other two countries for which the organization had data available for 2019. Most of that was fueled by population growth, about 80% of which comes from immigration.

The growing head count, in turn, has supported growth in consumer spending and a rebound in home sales and prices that began during the second half of last year. That helped Canada overcome a sharp slowdown in trade, muted business investment and a cooling global economy last year.

"Without the immigration boom, the Canadian economy would be lost right now," said David Rosenberg, chief economist at Toronto-based Rosenberg Research and Associates.

In any one year, economic growth is affected by many factors. The 2019 global slowdown largely resulted from trade tensions and China's loss of momentum. The U.S. Federal Reserve and several other central banks responded with interest-rate cuts or other stimulus measures. The U.S. economy, which grew 2.3% last year, also benefited from the lingering effects of recent tax cuts and government spending increases.

Canada has enjoyed relatively high population growth -- an annual average of around 1% since the early 2000s. It quickened after the Trudeau government bumped up immigration levels in 2016, reaching 1.4% in 2018, the fastest among the Group of Seven advanced economies, according to the World Bank. While full 2019 figures aren't available, recent Canadian government estimates place the annual rate at 1.5% in the year ended in October.

Canada, with a population of 38 million, accepted about 340,000 new permanent residents in 2019, up from 270,000 in 2015. It also issued roughly 810,000 permits to international students and temporary workers in 2019, up from about 470,000 four years earlier.

Economists say that influx helped Canada's economy expand 1.5% in 2019, the second-best pace in the G-7 after the U.S., according to International Monetary Fund estimates. The Trudeau administration's higher level of immigration has provided stimulus that's roughly comparable to an interest-rate cut of between a quarter percentage point and a half point, Bank of Nova Scotia economist Derek Holt said.

By contrast, economic growth was 0.5% in Germany and 1.2% in the euro area as a whole, according to the IMF, where waves of asylum seekers have hardened public attitudes on immigration.

Still, last year marked a loss of momentum amid the global slowdown. From 2010 through 2018, Canada's annual growth in gross domestic productaveraged 2.2%, slightly below the U.S. and above the rest of the G-7, according to the World Bank.

The Bank of Canada has held its benchmark overnight interest rate since October 2018 at 1.75%, the highest among major advanced economies. Many analysts now see a rising likelihood of central bank interest rate cuts this year, including possibly by Canada, due to the coronavirus outbreak's risk to global growth.

The Bank of Canada's next interest-rate announcement is due Wednesday.

One way population growth bolsters Canada's economy is through its housing markets. Home prices are rising again in Toronto and the surrounding area and have stabilized in Vancouver after mortgage rules aimed at limiting risky borrowing weighed on prices and sales in 2018 and early 2019.

"With more people living in the country, demand for housing has naturally increased," said TD Bank chief economist Beata Caranci.

Economists say Canada benefits from a system that gives preference to immigrants with the ability to find and keep a job, based on criteria such as education, language skills and whether they have a job offer. About 60% of the immigrants to Canada are selected with this criteria, a figure that also includes those immigrants' immediate family members. The rest come as refugees or to be reunited with family members already in Canada.

Among the recent arrivals in Canada is Albert Cuesta Reig, a Spaniard who came in 2016 to complete a master's degree in business administration at the University of Toronto. After receiving a three-year work visa he launched an app-based travel services business -- something he says wouldn't have been possible in the U.S., where he had studied for a year on an exchange program.

In the U.S., "they have amazing schools, but then it's hard to stick around and make use of the network you've built there," he said.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
The Afghan Withdrawal Deal

President Trump has made clear he wants all American troops out of Afghanistan, and on Saturday the U.S. signed an "agreement for bringing peace to Afghanistan" with the Taliban. The coming months will tell if this is a genuine path to peace or political cover for a U.S. exit.

The good news is that this agreement is better than what the U.S. had seemed to accept in September. The Taliban have killed thousands of Americans, and Mr. Trump shouldn't reward them with a Camp David signing ceremony as he first suggested.

The Taliban, or at least their representatives, have agreed to negotiate with the elected Afghan government for the first time. The Taliban want to establish an Islamist emirate and have previously refused to talk to the Kabul government. The Taliban have also promised to reduce their attacks on Afghan civilians and troops, as a week long test leading to Saturday demonstrated is possible.

For the first time the Taliban have also forsworn support for al Qaeda and are promising to prevent Afghanistan from being a safe haven for any group planning attacks against the U.S. This is the reason the U.S. sent troops to the country after 9/11, and the deal makes clear this is the main American priority.

In return, the U.S. is making significant concessions, in particular a 14-month path to the withdrawal of all American forces. The initial reduction to 8,600 troops from some 13,000 shouldn't be a problem. General Austin Miller, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, says this is enough to fulfill the U.S. mission.

The gamble, and it's a big one, is over the drawdown to zero by May 2021, including from all military bases in the country. This is conveniently after the November election, so Mr. Trump needn't worry about a Taliban march on Kabul before then. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also promised on Saturday in Qatar that this will be a "conditions-based troop withdrawal," and that it can cease if the Taliban reneges on its promises.

But the Taliban know how much Mr. Trump wants out, and it could decide to stand down until U.S. forces leave and then resume its siege against the government. A residual U.S. force including air power and special forces would be safer, but the Taliban and Mr. Trump both want the political boast of complete American withdrawal.

It's far from clear that the Taliban negotiators can deliver on their violence reduction promises. The group is led by local and regional commanders who may not take orders from leaders based in Pakistan. The Afghans are releasing 5,000 Taliban fighters from prison as part of the deal, and many of them will return to the fight.

As for talks with the Kabul government, the Taliban will have to abandon their desire to rule by unaccountable Shariah law. Perhaps some power-sharing or regional-control arrangement can be worked out.

But it's hard to see the Taliban agreeing to lay down their arms and join the Afghan security forces. The deal also has no guarantees to protect Afghan women, who have made great strides in education and health care since the U.S. intervention. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani will need a united front that includes political rival Abdullah Abdullah to have a chance at negotiating a decent outcome.

---

Americans are in a sour mood about foreign interventions, and after 18 years in Afghanistan the desire to come home is understandable. But public frustration shouldn't ignore the major U.S. accomplishments.

Our forces have denied terrorists a safe haven and protected the homeland from another large-scale attack. We have killed the al Qaeda leadership, including Osama bin Laden. We have assisted a Kabul government that, while far from perfect, is free and democratic. We have brought basic education to millions of young Afghans who never had it. And we have trained and equipped Afghan security forces to defend themselves. No one should diminish the sacrifices that Americans have made with their lives and long deployments by dismissing these achievements.

"We will not squander what they and you have won through blood, sweat and tears," Mr. Pompeo said on Saturday in Doha. No doubt he means it. We hope President Trump does too.

U.S. News: Trump Renews Push for Rate Cut

President Trump said he is counting on the Federal Reserve to shoulder the government's response to economic disruptions caused by the coronavirus, renewing the pressure campaign he has used against the central bank during previous bouts of market uncertainty.

After the stock markets' worst week since the financial crisis, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled in a statement Friday that the central bank is prepared to cut interest rates to cushion the U.S. economy against the effects of a potential public-health emergency and widening global slowdown.

"Good, it's about time," Mr. Trump said at a White House press conference Saturday, referring to the statement. He urged the Fed to reduce interest rates. "We need a Fed that's going to be a leader."

Mr. Trump said talk of an economic stimulus program from the White House or Congress, such as by cutting taxes for households and individuals, is premature.

"The big thing we are looking for is the Fed to do its job," he said. "I don't think the Democrats are going to approve any tax cuts." The administration would unveil tax-cut proposals toward the end of this year, he said.

A Fed spokeswoman declined to comment.

Investors had pushed stocks to record highs previously, sloughing off concerns that the coronavirus epidemic in China would drag the global economy into a prolonged slump. That changed last week, as cases spread in South Korea, Iran and Italy, raising the prospect that public-health officials would need to shift from containing the virus to mitigating its effects.

The S&P 500 suffered its fastest-ever 10% decline from an all-time high last week and the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its worst week since the 2008 global financial crisis. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note and 30-year bond hit record lows, a sign of investors fleeing risky assets for havens and of expectations for lower U.S. growth.

As investors looked for reassurance, Mr. Powell reprised language he used when the central bank adopted an easing bias last June. "The coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity," Mr. Powell said. "We will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy."

Economists and investors now expect the Fed to cut rates at its next scheduled meeting, March 17-18, if not before then. The Fed's benchmark rate has been in a range between 1.5% and 1.75% since October.

Mr. Trump has made the Fed a regular punching bag when the stock market declines or other potential portents of a recession appear.

He called on the Fed to cut rates or criticized its rate policy more than 80 times last year.

Banks Plan Backup Office Sites as Pandemic Prep

U.S. banks are preparing for a worsening coronavirus outbreak by laying plans to move staffers to back-office sites, limiting contact with clients who have been abroad and curbing employee travel.

Morgan Stanley, whose New York City stock-trading floor is the country's busiest, is preparing a backup site in suburban Westchester County. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has nixed all nonessential international trips. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is canceling some conferences and evaluating powering up a parallel trading floor in Greenwich, Conn.

Not since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks have Wall Street banks faced a logistical challenge like the one potentially posed by a coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. Sustained quarantines and widespread business closures would hit credit-card and corporate-lending businesses. Further interest-rate cuts, which the Federal Reserve may use to shore up the economy, would crimp profits.

"If planes are not flying in and out of China, if hotels are not being filled -- which they're not at the moment -- and if the supply chains are being impacted which I suspect they are, there's going to be some impact," Visa Inc. Chief Executive Officer Alfred Kelly said last month.

While technology has made it possible for many to work from home, the multiple screens and compliance systems installed on Wall Street trading floors can't be easily replicated on a laptop. And investment banking is still a face-to-face business, drummed up by weeks on the road.

Financial firms have drawn up elaborate contingency plans in recent years that they hope will allow them to keep operating smoothly. Just a few weeks ago, Bank of New York Mellon Corp. ran a drill temporarily shutting down its downtown Manhattan headquarters, an executive said.

Despite the market meltdown, trading floors at many banks remain calm. One salesperson said increased activity meant it was a bit noisier than usual, but nothing compared with the 2010 flash crash or the weeks leading up to the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers.

Banks and brokers have opened backup facilities throughout the world in recent years. Many are required by their regulators to plan and test for various scenarios, said Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Evercore ISI. Significant improvements in computing power and telecommunications networks also have made working remotely a possibility for many more employees.

One key obstacle for firms will be how they contend with rules on recording phone calls and other communications related to specific transactions when traders aren't working from their usual desk, one bank executive said. Industry officials are urging regulators to consider relaxing these surveillance rules in the event that employees are forced to work from home, this executive said.

Officials at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, an industry trade group, have raised the surveillance issue in discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission, along with other potential challenges Wall Street would face during a wide-scale evacuation of U.S. trading floors.

"We are providing information to them for them to consider," said Kenneth Bentsen, Sifma's president and CEO. "We haven't made a formal request."

In some ways, the job of girding against pandemic has gotten simpler. The advent of electronic exchanges, trading algorithms and other technological advances on the markets have steadily shrunk the number of employees on trading floors on Wall Street and elsewhere. And many who remain are in roles that can be performed adequately in remote locations.

With the addition of software engineers, compliance staff and other in-demand positions, the securities industry's total New York City workforce rose to 180,300 last year from 165,900 in 2003, according to the New York State Department of Labor. But the number of employees classified by the department as brokers -- or those who serve as intermediaries between buyers and sellers -- has dropped to 53,300 from 73,000 in the same period.

The 12 biggest global investment banks employed 26% fewer equity traders, salespeople and analysts at the end of 2019 than they did in 2010, according to industry-data firm Coalition Ltd. Front-office staff on bond-trading desks have tumbled 42% over the same period, according to Coalition.

That said, the task of limiting health risks is far-reaching. Like other large companies, lenders are limiting employee exposure to countries where the virus has taken hold. Morgan Stanley's upcoming annual Hong Kong summit will be virtual, while Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. have restricted employee travel to Asia and Italy.

Goldman's private bankers are canceling meetings with clients who have been to virus hot spots, according to clients. Registered attendees of several upcoming Goldman conferences received emails asking them to stay home if they recently visited virus-affected regions.

A sign at the front desk of the bank's downtown Manhattan headquarters asks visitors who have recently returned from mainland China -- or been in contact with someone who has -- to reschedule.

World News: U.S.-Taliban Deal Faced a Host of Hurdles

DOHA -- Until the last moment, organizers feared the smallest misstep might quash the signing of a historic deal between the U.S. and the Taliban, with mistrust and suspicion enduring until ink was on paper.

The deal -- providing for U.S. troops reductions, a Taliban renunciation of terrorism and intra-Afghan talks -- was more than a year in the making, encountering obstacles all the way up until its approval Saturday at a five-star resort in Doha. It still faces a "rocky and bumpy" road ahead, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday.

Minutes after Mr. Pompeo arrived in Doha for Saturday's signing, a Taliban video on Twitter showed Taliban representatives who had arrived to witness the signing of the deal engaged in a victory parade. The procession appeared to be marching toward the resort, their tunics and beards billowing in the wind beneath Taliban flags.

Organizers worried that Mr. Pompeo, with his reputed fiery temper, would see the flags -- the symbol of an Islamic emirate not recognized by the U.S. -- and walk out, people familiar with the matter said. The Qatari government hosts were on guard to stop the flags from entering the hotel; moments later, the Taliban procession arrived without them, the people said.

Tension abounded throughout the day. Mr. Pompeo warmly greeted other diplomats, but U.S. officials had made clear the secretary didn't want to be caught on camera with the insurgents, the people familiar with the matter said. Qatari officials were worried that the Taliban might try to approach Mr. Pompeo, and derail the deal in the final minutes of the event, the people said.

Despite finding himself obliged to shake hands with the Taliban's chief negotiator, Sher Muhammad Abbas Stanekzai, Mr. Pompeo sat stoically in the front row and didn't join in applause for remarks made by the Taliban's political office chief, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar.

When Mr. Pompeo delivered a speech urging the Taliban to "keep your promises" in the agreement, the Qataris worried the insurgents might walk out.

Then, as U.S. Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Mullah Baradar signed the deal, Taliban members in the audience shouted "Allahu akbar!" or "God is Great!"

For Mr. Khalilzad and his team, the signing of the agreement will be far from the end of the story. The pact faces major hurdles, including a political crisis over Afghanistan's contested, fraud-marred presidential election and the looming issue of prisoner exchanges, which the U.S.-Taliban agreement stipulates as a last step to the start of talks between the Taliban, the Afghan government, the opposition and other power brokers.

Mr. Ghani said Sunday that the prisoner release was under Afghan, not U.S., control and that it wouldn't take place as a precondition to intra-Afghan talks.

Afghan-born Mr. Khalilzad, who previously served as a presidential envoy for former President George W. Bush and then as ambassador to Afghanistan, was out of government in 2018 when he began to consult with Mr. Pompeo, who was then in charge of the Central Intelligence Agency.

Mr. Khalilzad was invited in August 2018 to discuss the job of U.S. envoy for talks with the Taliban, according to people familiar with the matter who discussed details of the process that led to the deal.

Mr. Pompeo wanted to know if the U.S. could secure a deal that would allow President Trump to pull all troops out of Afghanistan, while delivering assurances on terrorism and ensuring the Taliban and government would talk to each other, the people said.

Mr. Khalilzad agreed to the challenge, with a rough, one-year deadline in mind. The first meeting with the Taliban took place at the Qatari foreign ministry in Doha. The first steps at best were tentative: Mr. Khalilzad conveyed U.S. interest in a political settlement. The Taliban recapped the history of talks, the people said.

In Washington, many were skeptical that the Taliban's political office really represented the group. The U.S. pressed Pakistan to release Mullah Baradar, the movement's co-founder, to allow him to take part in the negotiations. Islamabad released him in October 2018, and two months later, the Taliban announced Mullah Baradar would lead the talks in Doha.

Throughout 2019, Mr. Khalilzad and his team of negotiators talked with Mullah Baradar and other Taliban officials, meeting in Doha to discuss the thorniest issues.

One of the toughest was persuading the Taliban, in renouncing support for terrorism, to specifically name al Qaeda in a final agreement document, a process that took several months. The final agreement doesn't contain the word "terrorist" or express regret for past actions, but contains a promise to break ties with the group.

For the Taliban, a key issue was the removal of "foreign forces," mainly meaning U.S. troops, although several thousand allied troops are still in Afghanistan. The Taliban wanted the Americans to leave within several months; a 14-month period was included in the agreement instead.

The U.S. said that, conditions permitting, it would reduce its troops from about 13,000 now to 8,600 in an initial period of 135 days, which was spelled out in the agreement. If other conditions are met, the remaining U.S. forces would leave next year.

The Taliban also resisted including intra-Afghan talks as part of the deal. In the end, the agreement provides only for the start of such talks, without stipulating an outcome.

Constitutional Case of the Year

The Supreme Court hears what may be its most important case of the year on Tuesday, and don't stop reading because it concerns the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This one goes to the heart of the separation of powers and whether the administrative state is accountable to the people.

Seila Law v. CFPB concerns whether a President can remove the bureau's director only for "inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office." This should be an easy call, but far more important is the remedy and whether the Justices merely sever the bureau's mutant head from its unconstitutional body.

Democrats created the CFPB in 2010 as an independent agency within the Federal Reserve. Yet unlike other independent agencies, it was designed to be politically insulated. The bureau gets funding automatically upon its director's request from the Fed, so it doesn't need Congressional appropriations.

Most agencies are led by a multi-member bipartisan commission, but the CFPB has a single director whom the President can only fire for cause. Congress gave the bureau broad enforcement power to investigate and penalize almost any business with any relation to finance. But its rules and orders are exempt from review by the Fed, and it needn't consult the White House budget office. The director, in short, is President of his own little government.

There have only been three independent analogs to the CFPB in history: the Office of Independent Counsel, the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). None possess the CFPB's enormous regulatory powers.

Congress established the Independent Counsel within the Justice Department after Watergate to oversee executive officers, but Congress declined to reauthorize it after Ken Starr's probe of Bill Clinton. The FHFA's structure is currently being litigated, and even Mr. Clinton once mused that the SSA's single director raised a "significant constitutional question."

As an appellate judge in 2016, now Justice Brett Kavanaugh ruled in PHH Corp. that the director's dismissal "for cause" scheme violates the separation of powers. He also found, however, that this provision could be severed from the rest of the CFPB statute so the bureau could survive. Judge Kavanaugh's ruling was overturned by the full D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, so his opinion has no legal standing. But its logic is crucial now that he is in the High Court and his vote could be decisive.

Judge Kavanaugh may have been trying to show judicial restraint on the D.C. Circuit, but he now has more leeway on the High Court and the case has been better briefed. Only if he reconsiders the severability issue can he address the law's gross separation-of-powers abuses. The director's scheme isn't a mere construct but is central to the law's design to be outside the control of both Congress and the President.

Merely severing the "for cause" provision would refashion the bureau into an executive agency like the Environmental Protection Agency but with no Congressional oversight. As the Seila Law brief argues: "Would Congress have preferred a regime in which the President had control over the agency tasked with enforcing those statutes, yet in which it had surrendered its own primary means of control over that same agency? It does not take a Ouija board to figure out the answer."

The Court would be rewriting the statute on its own, but without addressing its other constitutional infirmities. The better answer is to declare the entire law unconstitutional and give Congress the chance to rewrite it.

---

This is all the more important these days when the very structure of the separation of powers is under assault. The liberal legal scholar Cass Sunstein, normally a serious fellow, wrote recently that the Justice Department should be independent of the President. Alexander Hamilton would have devoted several Federalist Papers to refuting that idea of a chief executive for prosecutions.

If the Supreme Court lets the CFPB stand as it is, and merely skirts around the edges of its illegality by barring the "for cause" provision, this will not be the last such agency that Congress creates. The administrative state will become even less accountable to political control than it already is.

Tossing the whole law would invalidate all CFPB actions to date, but the Court also did this when it overturned Barack Obama's illegal recess appointments in Noel Canning (2014). In the CFPB there may be fewer reliance interests since reverting to the pre-Dodd Frank status quo would leave other independent agencies to enforce consumer financial laws.

Our suggestion is that the Court strike down the law but delay the ruling's implementation for a year or so to give Congress and the President time to amend the law if they see fit. If the current Court is serious about reviving the original meaning of the separation of powers, the CFPB is an ideal opportunity to send a shot heard 'round Washington.

Life & Arts: In 'ZeroZeroZero,' A Gritty, Global Tale of Drug Trade

A shipment of cocaine's impact on the lives of the rich and poor is given a kaleidoscopic perspective in Amazon Prime's new eight-part dramatic series "ZeroZeroZero."

It is the latest series after "Narcos," "McMafia" and "Gomorrah" to take a global view of crime. In this tale, which premiers Friday on Amazon Prime, Italian writer and director Stefano Sollima takes viewers across three different continents, and manages an internationally diverse cast and crew speaking several languages.

In the series, Mr. Sollima and his co-directors (Pablo Trapero and Janus Metz) focus on the small-time dealers of a Calabrian cartel that purchases the cocaine; the Mexican cartel that is selling it; and the Lynwoods: a wealthy American shipping family that brokers the deal.

As was the case with "Gomorrah," which became Italy's most popular television export to date, Mr. Sollima's basis for "ZeroZeroZero" is a nonfiction bestseller by Italian investigative journalist Roberto Saviano. The title riffs on the rating system for Italian baking flour where "zero, zero" is the top grade of purity.

As a writer and director Mr. Sollima is known for a gritty realism that captures the neon glitter, concrete and shadowy back streets of cities. His latest series is in English, Spanish and Calabrian dialect with subtitles. Mr. Sollima, 53, has always insisted on using the appropriate dialect on his projects, whether the Roman street slang of the 1970s for "Romanzo Criminale" or the Neapolitan lingo in "Gomorrah."

"I am always looking to make something as close to reality as possible," Mr. Sollima says. "Getting the language right helps to create a strange and electric atmosphere."

The Wall Street Journal spoke to Mr. Sollima, who has also directed movies like "Sicario: Day of the Soldado" (2018), about the cocaine economy and the challenges of shooting a global TV series. Here, an edited transcript.

WSJ: What were the challenges of turning a nonfiction book like "ZeroZeroZero" into a fictional TV series?

A: Roberto Saviano's book was a journalistic expose so it provided a lot of great information without any narrative structure. What we did basically was to take some of the different worlds that he explored in "ZeroZeroZero" and develop those, while trying to stay true to the spirit of his book. We took inspiration for most of the characters from real-life people but I don't think audiences will be able to recognize who they are.

WSJ: Were you convinced by the thesis of Mr. Saviano's book that through the cocaine trade you can see the world?

A: Yes, for me the book's a really smart take on globalization through the prism of one of the world's most controversial merchandises: Cocaine. It is fascinating to see how all the countries that are affected by narcotrafficking change because of money that has been laundered and recycled into their economies. Even for those not using or dealing cocaine it has become part of our lives because of the incredible amount of money it generates.

WSJ: In Mr. Saviano's book he argues for the legalization of cocaine but you don't put forward that argument in the series. Why?

A: I don't feel that a TV show or a movie is a place where you should get political. When you're dealing with a really complex matter like this one I think it's better to ask smart questions than give unhelpful answers. It's up to the audience to have its own point of view on this topic.

WSJ: "ZeroZeroZero" was shot in Italy, the U.S., Mexico, Morocco and Senegal. Did you face any difficulties?

A: Yes, we ran into political problems in Mexico. We were supposed to shoot most of our scenes in Monterrey. But when we were about to start filming there [in 2018] a lot of people were killed during the local elections. So we had to move our shoot because it wasn't safe for us. We also experienced logistical problems in Calabria because we shot up in the mountains where it was pretty tough to transport our crew and equipment.

WSJ: "ZeroZeroZero" portrays a world without any moral point of view to latch onto. Do you think this is more of a European sensibility than an American one?

A: I don't know about that. It's more my sensibility. I have never liked to express my moral point of view in my work. The challenge is to portray a world as it is without any filter and without judging. For me that is at the heart of good storytelling. I think audiences are smart enough not to need a guide telling them how they should be feeling.

WSJ: Andrea Riseborough plays Emma Lynwood, a woman who is thrust into a male-dominated world yet is never overawed by it. Was this a character inspired by someone in real life?

A: No, she was a pure invention. The Lynwood family doesn't have any inspiration from real life. I thought it was cool to have a woman who is handling the family business. Her father is the figurehead of the family shipping company but she is the one who does everything that needs to be done. In the beginning she opposes her father because she would like the family's business to be legitimate. But she discovers that's not possible because everything that is legitimate in their company is dependent on the incredible amount of money that comes from the drug trafficking.

WSJ: Now that you've been courted by Hollywood are you still planning to keep developing Italian projects?

A: That is what I am trying to do. Right after "Soldado" I did "ZeroZeroZero" which for the most part is a European production that started as an Italian project. It's interesting to see a foreign movie like "Parasite" win the Academy Award. With the advent of streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon people have grown used to watching drama from foreign countries. Modern audiences are curious and not bothered by subtitles. I think that existed before "Parasite" which has just confirmed what we already know.

The global networks of modern crime are reflected in a growing number of television series shot in multiple languages. Here are other series in the same genre:

"McMafia" (AMC)

This eight-part crime drama was inspired by British journalist Misha Glenny's 2008 nonfiction book "McMafia: A Journey Through the Global Criminal Underworld." Its filming locations included London, Croatia, Qatar, Mumbai, Prague, Cairo, Belgrade, Belize, Istanbul, Moscow and Tel Aviv. A second season was recently commissioned by the BBC.

"Narcos" (Netflix)

This American crime drama is mostly set and filmed in Colombia, but with some scenes in the United States. The first two out of three seasons focus on the rise and fall of Pablo Escobar. The dialogue switches between Spanish and English. A spin-off series "Narcos: Mexico," which explores the origin of the modern war on drugs, premiered its second season last month.

"The Bureau" (iTunes)

This French political thriller about terror-related crimes focuses on the lives of agents working for the DGSE, France's main external security service. Its first four seasons were shot between Paris and Morocco which stood in for locations in Algeria, Iran and Syria. A fifth season was recently commissioned by Canal+.

"Giri/Haji" (Netflix)

This eight-part British crime thriller set in Tokyo and London switches dialogue between English and Japanese. It follows a Tokyo detective who travels to London in search of his brother, who he previously thought was dead. It contrasts the criminal codes of the Yakuza with unruly elements of the London underworld.

Warren, Unlike Sanders, Makes the Medicare Math Add Up

Bernie Sanders released an updated plan last week to pay for Medicare for All. The plan is light on details, but leaves the senator at least $12.5 trillion short of covering the cost of his health-care proposal over 10 years. It calls for some tax increases on working families, but the real burden may be much higher than advertised: Mr. Sanders may have to raise taxes on American workers by 16 percentage points or more to avoid multitrillion-dollar deficits. Fortunately, Elizabeth Warren's financing plan for Medicare for All offers a better alternative.

Mr. Sanders's blueprint identifies $17.5 trillion in new federal revenue over the next 10 years, sourced to new or higher taxes on workers and corporations, among other changes to the code. Mr. Sanders bases his calculations on a study by Yale researchers published recently in the Lancet, which found that his plan would reduce national health spending from $52 trillion over a decade to $47 trillion. Mr. Sanders claims he will redirect the current projected $30 trillion in federal, state and local health-care spending over the next decade to Medicare for All. Thus, he says he only needs $17 trillion to fill the gap.

There are three problems with his math. First, the Yale study didn't account for the cost of Mr. Sanders's long-term care program -- estimated at around $2.5 trillion. Second, the study assumed reimbursement cuts to hospitals that Mr. Sanders hasn't explicitly endorsed. Third, Mr. Sanders's $30 trillion in projected federal spending includes funding for the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and more. This money can't be spent on Medicare for All unless it is zeroed out from these vital public-health agencies.

Most analyses have found that the Sanders Medicare for All proposal would require around $30 trillion in new federal spending over a decade. That leaves Mr. Sanders $12.5 trillion short of what he needs to cover the cost of his plan.

How could Mr. Sanders fill the gap? His plan includes two proposals that affect middle-class families. One is a 4% "income-based premium" on workers, which excludes the first $29,000 in income for a family of four. This "premium" would be an additional tax on income above the exclusion floor, and presumably even less income would be excluded for single workers or those without children. The senator says this tax will generate $4 trillion over 10 years. To make up the $12.5 trillion shortfall, that tax would need to be roughly four times as large -- the equivalent of a tax increase of 16% of income.

Mr. Sanders's second proposal is a 7.5% payroll tax paid by employers that exempts the first $1 million of a company's payroll. Mr. Sanders estimates this would generate $5.2 trillion over 10 years. To generate the missing $12.5 trillion, that payroll tax rate would need to reach roughly 26.5%. And while the employer receives the bill, higher payroll taxes are mostly passed on to workers in lower wages, reduced hours or both.

Mr. Sanders could raise taxes on the wealthy and big corporations. But he already plans to do that: His financing for Medicare for All and other plans includes a wealth tax, a substantial corporate tax increase, a financial-transactions tax, an increase in the top personal tax rate, and a capital-gains tax increase. There isn't room to squeeze trillions in additional revenue out of these sources.

Mr. Sanders is adamant that total costs for middle-class families will go down, because new taxes will be less than what families save on health-care costs. This is plausible in the aggregate at certain income levels. But it is implausible that every middle-class family will come out ahead -- especially if the plan is fully paid for in taxes.

The plan Ms. Warren released in October addresses these vulnerabilities. Unlike Mr. Sanders's plan, it commits to specific reimbursement rates for health-care providers -- roughly 110% of current Medicare rates. Her plan brings the overall cost of Medicare for All down to $20.5 trillion over 10 years, according to an analysis I did with Donald Berwick, who ran the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Obama. Ms. Warren's plan doesn't raise taxes on the middle class. Every business that pays for employee health insurance today will pay less for each employee during the transition.

As Democrats choose a nominee, they should consider which candidate's Medicare for All financing plan is best for working families and provides the most appealing general election message.

U.S. News: High Court to Take Up ACA Case --- A ruling, likely not before the election, will potentially address all parts of health law

WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court agreed to once again decide the fate of the Affordable Care Act, but it likely won't do so before the 2020 presidential election.

The court on Monday announced it would consider an appeal by a group of Democratic-led states that are defending the 2010 health-care overhaul legislation, a signature achievement for President Obama. The ACA is under legal attack from a group of Republican states, which found a new tactic for challenging the law in 2018 -- based on a provision requiring Americans to buy health insurance or pay a penalty -- after the Supreme Court previously preserved the ACA in decisions in 2012 and in 2015.

The high court isn't placing the case on an accelerated schedule, meaning the justices won't get to it before their summer break. Instead, the case will be scheduled for the court's next term, which begins in October 2020 and runs through the following June.

The timing means the decision is unlikely to come before Election Day, leaving the ACA in legal limbo. The slower timeline also means the Trump administration won't necessarily be forced to grapple with U.S. health-care policy before voters go to the polls.

In weighing the case, the justices could rule on the viability of every provision of the sweeping law. In addition to the mandate that most people carry health insurance, the ACA barred insurers from denying coverage -- or charging more -- to people with existing health conditions. It also allowed young adults to stay on their parents' plans until they turned 26 and expanded the availability of Medicaid coverage for limited-income Americans.

The ACA contains hundreds of other provisions, including ones that require contraception coverage and federally recommended vaccines to be covered at no cost, and that mandate nutritional labeling on restaurant menus and vending machines.

The New Orleans-based Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in December that the individual insurance mandate, a central feature of the ACA, was unconstitutional.

The ruling avoided saying whether the rest of the sprawling health law could remain in force without the mandate. The appeals court instead ordered the Texas judge who first heard the case to reconsider his decision that no part of the ACA remained valid.

The health law remains in effect during the litigation. President Trump has pledged to roll it back and has long promised to release his own health plan. His administration isn't defending the law in court and instead is siding with the challengers in the case.

Republican plaintiffs, led by the state of Texas, found an opening to challenge the law anew after Congress in 2017 reduced the insurance-mandate penalty to $0. The change came as part of a broad tax-overhaul package passed by a GOP Congress and signed by Mr. Trump.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said, "Without the individual mandate, the entire law becomes unsupportable. The federal government cannot order private citizens to purchase subpar insurance that they don't want, and I look forward to finally settling the matter before the U.S. Supreme Court."

Lower courts agreed with that argument. Congress's taxing power was central to the majority opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts in 2012 to uphold the insurance mandate.

The law's supporters say it doesn't make sense that the mandate would suddenly become unconstitutional now that it is less burdensome.

The same five justices that upheld the ACA in 2012 remain on the court.

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who leads a coalition of 20 states and Washington, D.C. defending the ACA, said he was pleased with the high court's decision to hear their appeal. "As Texas and the Trump administration fight to disrupt our health-care system and the coverage that millions rely upon, we look forward to making our case in defense of the ACA," he said.

The Justice Department, which is representing the Trump administration in court, declined to comment.

It Is Too Soon to Buy Stocks on Coronavirus Dip --- Shares seem cheaper but might soon look more expensive as forecasts catch up with situation

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

How far do stocks have to fall before they are worth buying? Part of what has made the market so perilous is that, without the ability to even roughly estimate what the ultimate effect of the novel coronavirus's spread will be on profits and the economy, it is impossible to tell.

In the space of less than two weeks since it last hit a record high, the S&P 500 has fallen about 9%. That has made the index appear far less expensive: It now trades at about 17.6 times analysts' estimated 2020 earnings, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv, down from 19.2 at its peak.

Yet over that time profit estimates have barely budged, and analysts' current forecasts imply earnings per share for companies in the S&P 500 will rise by 7.4% this year from last.

As a group, analysts have a deserved reputation for hands-over-their-eyes optimism, and indeed at least until recently many of them were seriously underestimating the effects of the outbreak. But that isn't entirely what is going on here.

Rather, because they lack the information they need to incorporate the coronavirus epidemic into their estimates, analysts are largely letting their stale estimates stand while acknowledging that the risks are skewed substantially to the downside.

They are following the lead of companies that, insofar as they have reduced sales and earnings forecasts as a result of the coronavirus epidemic, have only done so if they already have experienced quantifiable direct effects to their businesses.

Economists and strategists have begun forecasting much more severe coronavirus effects than what analyst estimates and corporate earnings and sales guidance show.

Goldman Sachs economists, for example, have lowered their estimates for both global and U.S. gross domestic product, and Goldman strategist David Kostin is now forecasting no earnings growth. If that is right, the S&P 500 trades at about 18.7 times expected earnings -- about 6% richer a valuation than what a price-earnings ratio using analyst estimates suggests.

Yet Mr. Kostin's estimate has large error bars around it given that economists, too, are in the dark about what the coronavirus impact will be. Goldman's economists, for example, have trimmed their U.S. GDP estimates repeatedly over the past month or so, including over the weekend. Toward the end of January, they estimated GDP would grow at a 2% annual rate in the first quarter and 2.6% in the second quarter. Now they expect GDP will grow by just 0.9% in the first quarter, not at all in the second and with a recovery beginning in the third. They also reckon the Federal Reserve will cut its target range on overnight rates by half a percentage point this month, and another half thereafter. Like most economists, Goldman's think the U.S. will avoid a recession, but they note "the downside risks have clearly grown." And if there is a recession? Then Mr. Kostin thinks earnings will fall by 13%. But again, that is just a forecast. Investors tempted by apparent bargains should think twice.

U.S. News: Bump-Stock Ban Allowed to Stand

The Supreme Court on Monday refused to consider a challenge by certain gun owners to the Trump administration's ban on bump stocks, rapid-fire devices that were used in the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting.

The court, in a brief written order, let stand an appeals court decision last year that said gun owners had failed to show the Justice Department acted unreasonably and outside its legal authority when it prohibited bump stocks.

President Trump has courted gun-rights advocates by voicing support for strong Second Amendment protections. But in the wake of the Las Vegas massacre, which left 58 victims dead, he ordered his administration to ban devices that effectively turn legal weapons into machine guns, which are generally prohibited by federal law.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, part of the Justice Department, followed with a regulation in late 2018 that did so. Attorney General William Barr signed off on the ban after he took office.

Gun owners that filed suit argued the ATF's regulation marked a departure from how the agency had previously interpreted statutes addressing machine guns.

The Justice Department said its approach reflected the best interpretation of federal law.

A divided appeals court rejected the challengers' claims in April, and the Supreme Court's order left that decision in place.

The high court previously declined to temporarily halt the ban before it went into effect last year.

Grammys Chief Ousted After Investigation

The organization that hands out the Grammys said it fired its chief executive, Deborah Dugan, more than six weeks after placing her on administrative leave amid conflicting allegations of harassment.

The Recording Academy's board placed Ms. Dugan, its first female CEO, on involuntary leave just a few days before its flagship awards show, saying a subordinate had complained that Ms. Dugan had treated her abusively. Ms. Dugan responded in a discrimination complaint a few days later that it was she who had been harassed by the academy's general counsel, Joel Katz. Ms. Dugan alleged in the complaint that Mr. Katz, a music-industry lawyer, invited her to a private dinner soon after she was named CEO, at which he called her "baby," made inappropriate comments about her appearance and tried to kiss her.

A lawyer for Ms. Dugan said Monday: "The decision is despicable and, in due course, the Academy, [its] leadership and its attorneys will be held accountable under the law."

Howard Weitzman, a lawyer for Mr. Katz, said in January that Ms. Dugan's allegations "are false and Mr. Katz categorically and emphatically denies her version of that evening."

The academy released a letter on Monday saying it had commissioned two independent investigations: one into the allegations against Ms. Dugan, the other into her own complaints. In a separate statement, the vice chair of the academy's board of trustees, Tammy Hurt, said "the investigation overwhelmingly confirmed the serious complaints that had been lodged against her by a multitude of Recording Academy staff members."

Without offering further details on the allegations against Ms. Dugan or the investigations' findings, the organization indicated its board chairman, Harvey Mason Jr., would continue serving as interim CEO as it begins searching for a new permanent chief.

Ms. Dugan was named CEO last summer. Her predecessor, Neil Portnow, resigned after making public remarks that were widely interpreted as sexist. Mr. Portnow told an interviewer that women who want to rise through the music industry's ranks should "step up."

Ms. Dugan's discrimination complaint against the academy raised several allegations, including that board members had conflicts of interest and that the organization's awards-voting system was rigged. The academy's statement on Monday called such allegations "unwarranted and damaging."

Chinese Businesses Start to Feel Squeezed

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

The last time most people saw a chart as cliff-shaped as China's February purchasing managers index was probably during the global financial crisis.

Quarantine measures to contain the coronavirus have all but brought the economy to a halt: The headline factory PMI dropped nearly 15 points to its weakest level ever. The services PMI fell even further.

Investors, who pushed the Shanghai bourse up 3% Monday, are betting this is a clear case of bad news equals good news. Surely the central bank will ride to the rescue?

More help from Beijing is definitely coming, but the scale of the response may not be as large as investors hope for the simple reason that China's banking system isn't well-equipped to help the small businesses most at risk.

There were a few encouraging signs from the PMI. Around 80% of medium- and large-size enterprises are now open again, according to the statistics bureau.

But the overall picture remains grim. Only 58% of migrant workers who left major cities before the Lunar New Year holiday had returned by Sunday, according to Morgan Stanley. Intracity traffic congestion remains about 20% lower than at the same time last year.

And as restaurants and factories sit idle, companies with high fixed costs -- like salaried employees and debt payments -- are burning cash.

The first quarter is always tough for such businesses in China because of bonuses paid to employees, combined with the long holiday. The coronavirus has supercharged the problem. ANZ Bank estimates the quarantine measures will cost corporate China at least 2.6 trillion yuan ($372 billion) in cash flow in the first quarter, while consulting firm Gavekal puts the hit at around 4 trillion yuan.

Large listed companies and state-owned firms can survive by borrowing, squeezing suppliers or simply running down cash balances.

But small private companies that don't have large cash reserves and have trouble getting loans from the state-owned banking system may have no choice but to cut staff, salaries or investment. The hit could be substantial: Gavekal estimates companies could be forced to cut investment by 2 trillion yuan, about 2% of gross domestic product.

Policy makers will probably try to offset some of this with higher investment in public works. More government debt issuance seems likely in coming weeks. Banking regulators are also telling lenders to give small businesses a break on debt repayment in the first half.

But none of this adds up to a 2009-style stimulus yet. Even assuming some catch-up in the second quarter, significantly slower growth this year looks baked in the cake.

World News: OECD Warns Epidemic Threatens Growth

Global economic growth will slow sharply this year as governments attempt to contain the coronavirus epidemic, although the scale of the setback is highly uncertain, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said.

In its "best case" scenario, the Paris-based research body on Monday said the global economy would grow by 2.4%, weaker than the 2.9% expansion projected before the viral outbreak. That lost growth is roughly equivalent to $400 billion. But it said much more severe slowdowns are possible.

Global growth slowed in 2019, and was particularly weak in the final three months of the year. Given that starting point, the OECD said it is possible the global output will fall during the first three months of this year, putting the economy at risk of recession.

However, the research body is forecasting a rebound in growth during 2021, assuming the outbreak is contained over the coming months. But that recovery wouldn't be immediate, and some lost output would never be recovered.

"It's not like it plunges and then it recovers quickly," said Laurence Boone, the OECD's chief economist.

To date, the outbreak has been most severe in China, and the government has responded with travel bans and quarantine requirements that have closed factories and left service providers without customers.

In its best-case scenario, the OECD forecasts that China's economy will grow 4.9% this year, down from its previous projection of 5.7%. However, it expects growth to rebound to 6.4% in 2021, having previously forecast an expansion of 5.5%.

Leaders of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund said Monday they are prepared to use tools including emergency financing to help countries address the coronavirus.

"We will use our available instruments to the fullest extent possible, including emergency financing, policy advice and technical assistance," they said.

IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass said international cooperation is essential to deal with the health and economic effects. Finance ministers for the Group of Seven advanced economies plan to hold a conference call Tuesday morning to discuss their response to the virus, a U.S. Treasury spokeswoman confirmed.

In the U.S., the factory sector remained narrowly in expansion territory in February, although concerns about the coronavirus and its impact on supply chains rattled manufacturers.

The Institute for Supply Management said Monday its manufacturing index fell to 50.1 in February from 50.9 in January. Readings above 50 indicate activity is expanding across the manufacturing sector, while those below 50 signal contraction.

"Tariffs have been overshadowed by the global coronavirus disruptions as the top issue on supply chain managers' agendas -- at 42% of general comments, up from 2.5% in January," said Tim Fiore, who oversees the ISM survey of factory purchasing and supply managers. "I don't think we've hit the peak of the impact."

A survey of businesses released Monday by data firm IHS Markit found that manufacturing activity in China experienced its steepest slump on record during February. The country's Purchasing Managers Index fell to 40.3 from 50.1 in January, its lowest level since April 2004. A reading below 50 points to a drop in activity.

China accounts for a little more than 16% of global economic output, so disruption in the world's second-largest economy is expected to have an impact on a number of other economies. The OECD said those with the closest links -- Japan, South Korea and Australia -- will suffer most from a drop in Chinese tourists, a fall in Chinese demand for commodities and other goods, and an interruption in the supply of Chinese-made parts that are needed to complete products made in other countries.

The OECD said that makers of computers, electronics, pharmaceuticals and transport equipment around the world are particularly reliant on Chinese parts.

Teen Suspect's Understanding Is Key

Whether young criminal suspects are capable of understanding the criminal-justice system and their Miranda rights might be tested in the case of a 13-year-old boy charged in the killing of a Barnard College student.

Last week, a lawyer for the teen asked a judge to allow two experts on teens' comprehension to serve at his murder trial as witnesses.

One expert, Jennifer Woolard, a professor of psychology at Georgetown University, has compared teens' ability to understand the legal process with that of mentally ill adults.

Suspects younger than 14 perform poorly in their understanding of the legal processes, with roughly one-third of them showing "a level of impairment consistent with that of persons found incompetent to stand trial," according to a study she co-wrote.

The other expert, Emily Haney-Caron, an assistant professor of psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, has argued that suspects younger than 15 should be prohibited from waiving their Miranda rights because they aren't mature enough to understand the consequences of talking to police without counsel.

Miranda warnings state that a suspect has the right to remain silent and have a lawyer present. Their roles in juvenile cases have been questioned by some attorneys who argue that certain young defendants don't understand the crucial need to exercise those rights.

New York state family court Judge Carol Goldstein on Friday prohibited Ms. Haney-Caron from testifying in the boy's trial, citing insufficient evidence of her expertise on Miranda rights and teens. However, the judge permitted Ms. Woolard to testify Friday. The boy's trial is set to begin in the coming weeks.

Ms. Haney-Caron and Ms. Woolard declined to comment.

The 13-year-old is charged as a minor with murder in the second degree and robbery in the first degree in the fatal stabbing of Tessa Majors, an 18-year-old freshman who was killed Dec. 11 in Manhattan's Morningside Park. He has denied the charges through his attorneys and is being held as he awaits his trial.

Two other boys, both 14, were arrested and charged with murder as adults. They have pleaded not guilty.

The day after the killing, the 13-year-old was interviewed at Manhattan's 26th Precinct by New York Police Department Detective Wilfredo Acevedo. The boy's uncle was present, but the boy had no lawyer.

In the interview, the boy admitted to participating in the killing of Ms. Majors, Detective Acevedo said at a hearing in December. The detective said he recited the Miranda warning for the teen before the interview.

Marsha Levick, chief legal officer at the Philadelphia-based Juvenile Law Center, who co-wrote a 2018 academic journal article with Ms. Haney-Caron, cited research on brain development to assert young teens lack the capacity to give valid waivers to their Miranda rights. "The law has not caught up with the science in this issue," Ms. Levick said in an interview.

Some evidence suggests juveniles are more likely than adults to confess to crimes they didn't commit. Thirty-eight percent of exonerations for crimes allegedly committed by youth under 18 involved false confessions, compared with 11% for adults, according to one study of individuals who were wrongly convicted and later cleared of all charges.

NYPD spokeswoman Devora Kaye said a large number of experienced homicide investigators in the case of Ms. Majors "have used proven legally permissible methods that have been upheld by the courts to bring justice for the victim and her family."

"From the outset, given the seriousness of the crime, as well as the age of the suspects, the department proceeded with careful consideration," Ms. Kaye said.

Both a representative for the city attorneys who are prosecuting the boy and a representative for the boy's defense attorney, Legal Aid Society lawyer Hannah Kaplan, declined to comment.

Liz Crotty, a former Manhattan assistant district attorney, said other evidence, besides the boy's alleged statements, would be important for prosecutors in the case. "You have to look at the totality of the factors, I think, even more so when it's younger children," Ms. Crotty said.

Eugene O'Donnell, professor of law and police studies at John Jay College, said it is important to make sure statements by young suspects are given freely and knowingly because the unfiltered claims by the accused can be powerful for jurors. "Once a jury hears out of the mouths of kids they're implicating themselves, it's really powerful evidence," he said.

Outbreak Pounds European Bank Stocks

European banks have long been considered one of the weaker links in the global financial system. The coronavirus outbreak on the continent poses a fresh test of their health.

Shares in European banks have been among the worst hit since the virus began to spread, first through Italy, and now through much of the rest of the region. Their stocks took another hammering Monday amid signs the impact of the virus is starting to hurt economies, which has immediate effects on banks' business of taking and lending money.

Shares of UniCredit SpA and Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, both based in Milan, the epicenter of the virus outbreak in Europe, fell 4.4% and 2.8% respectively.

Germany's Deutsche Bank AG, which is undergoing a big overhaul, was seeing its stock make rare gains until the coronavirus took effect. Shares of the bank fell 1.5% Monday after falling 17% last week.

France's BNP Paribas SA and Societe Generale SA are down close to 20% this year. Asia-focused but London-listed Standard Chartered PLC and HSBC Holdings PLC have also seen their shares fall sharply.

Already toiling amid negative rates and slow growth, banks have been slashing costs to survive. Now they face the prospect of the economies and companies they serve being hit by the coronavirus outbreak, worsening a challenging outlook.

The cost of funding of major European banks -- a measure of how risky investors perceive them to be -- has risen sharply since last week as markets grapple with the speed at which the virus spread to the continent. Bank stocks, meanwhile, have sunk, leaving many banks deeper into the red.

"The market conditions and sentiment continue to head south, with no bottom as-of-yet seen," said Tom Kinmonth, a fixed-income strategist at Dutch bank ABN AMRO.

Banks in Europe are better equipped to face a crisis since boosting capital and liquidity levels following the sovereign- debt crisis in 2010. Funding costs are still below those at the start of last year despite last week's spike, Mr. Kinmonth said. But a global recession would translate into a pickup in defaults and souring loans, forcing banks to take losses and hurting already weak profitability.

Rattled markets, meanwhile, will hurt investment-banking activities and private-banking operations. Deutsche Bank, Barclays PLC and Swiss banks such as Credit Suisse AG and UBS Group AG would be particularly hit, RBC Capital Markets analysts said.

"The key question mark revolves around the depth and length of the [virus] containment measures, and the impact these will have on the economies, which would then in turn affect bank financials, starting from asset quality," said Marco Troiano, deputy head of the banks team at rating agency Scope Ratings.

Italian lenders are particularly vulnerable on that front. Some northern Italian towns were quarantined over a week ago as cases of the virus surged. Two regions most affected -- Lombardy, where Milan is the capital, and Veneto, home to Venice -- account for almost a third of the country's economic output and about 40% of Italy's exports.

Any sharper slowdown will affect people's ability to pay their debts. While bad loans from the past crisis have fallen in recent years, they still account for 7% of the total in the system.

Jerome Legras, head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments, said disruption for banks is more akin to the panic seen after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in New York, rather than the sovereign-debt crisis that put European countries in a multiyear recession.

Still, he said he is being cautious on banks that have a large international footprint, especially in Asia, and lenders that are sensitive to low rates, in case central banks decide to react.

The gloomy tone comes as many European banks reported disappointing results for last year, with most blaming low or negative interest rates that have eaten into their profit margins to a point they can't cover their costs. One of the hopes for the sector has been consolidation, particularly after the European Central Bank, which supervises the continent's largest banks, showed willingness to ease the process, which is risky and expensive.

Last month, Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo launched a 4.9 billion euro ($5.4 billion) takeover bid for a smaller rival UBI Banca SpA, with many expecting other deals to come. But the current market commotion will likely freeze any merger discussions, analysts say.

WASHINGTON -- Novartis AG's Sandoz subsidiary will pay a $195 million criminal penalty for fixing prices on generic drugs, the Justice Department announced Monday.

The department said Sandoz admitted it was guilty of participating in several conspiracies to rig bids and fix prices on an array of generic medicines.

Sandoz entered into a deferred prosecution agreement and is cooperating with the federal government's investigation, the department said. The criminal penalty was the highest the department has assessed for a purely domestic price-fixing cartel, officials said.

Under the agreement, the four felony counts against Sandoz will be dropped after three years if it lives up to its commitments to the Justice Department.

"Today's resolution, with one of the largest manufacturers of generic drugs, is a significant step toward ensuring that prices for generic drugs are set by competition, not collusion, and rooting out antitrust crimes that cheated American purchasers of vital medicines," said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department's antitrust chief.

"We are disappointed that this misconduct occurred in the face of our clear antitrust compliance policies and multiple trainings -- and in full contravention of the company's values," said Sandoz President Carol Lynch.

Ex-SUNY Polytechnic Head Sues Over Patent

ALBANY -- Former SUNY Polytechnic Institute President Alain Kaloyeros and another scientist are suing an arm of the state university, saying it isn't doing its job to monetize a chip-making process they patented in 2002.

Dr. Kaloyeros, who left the school after he was charged by federal prosecutors in a 2016 bid-rigging scheme, said in a lawsuit filed Friday that the SUNY Research Foundation has deprived him and a former graduate student of tens of millions of dollars of income. The former graduate student, Dr. Ana Londergan, is now an engineer at Qualcomm Inc.

The suit, filed in state court in Albany, seeks monetary damages and demands that the Research Foundation relinquish the patent. The foundation was set up to own and manage the intellectual property of faculty and researchers at the State University of New York's 64 campuses. It is responsible for commercializing patents.

Holly Liapis, a spokeswoman for the SUNY Research Foundation, said it "has standards and practices for protecting intellectual property, including the transfer of technologies and the management of royalties." She declined to comment on the litigation.

Dr. Kaloyeros is a leading nanotechnology scientist and helped establish SUNY Polytechnic's campus in western Albany as a research center for companies, including International Business Machines Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co.

After taking office in 2011, Gov. Andrew Cuomo tasked Dr. Kaloyeros with spreading the high-tech school's footprint to develop facilities in other upstate areas, including a solar panel factory in Buffalo. SUNY Poly announced plans for a film studio near Syracuse, a chip fabrication factory outside Utica and a pharmaceutical plant near Dunkirk. Many of the projects were delayed by the charges against Dr. Kaloyeros.

In 2018, Dr. Kaloyeros and three construction executives were found guilty of rigging the bids to build the Buffalo facility as well as a factory in Syracuse. Dr. Kaloyeros was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison. He maintained his innocence and remains free pending an appeal.

The patent referenced in the lawsuit relates to a process for using ultrathin layers of cobalt as an interconnection material in microchips. The suit claims an unidentified chip manufacturer began using the process in 2016 without paying any royalties to the foundation, which would then be shared with the inventors.

China Property Market Draws In Bond Investors

Even as home sales in China dry up because of the coronavirus epidemic, international bond investors are keeping faith with major real-estate groups.

The resilience of Chinese property debt contrasts with a steep decline in business, as developers are forced to close sales centers, and with a slide in property shares signaling that the sector's earnings are likely to suffer.

In a Feb. 26 note, Goldman Sachs analysts said recent property-sales volume across 30 major cities was barely a quarter of the seasonal norm. Heavyweight China Evergrande Group, the country's most indebted developer, has moved to drum up business with promotions such as offering steep discounts for residential-property purchases made online.

Despite the challenges, credit markets appear confident that big players have the financial firepower to withstand months of disruption. It helps that many companies issued dollar debt in the first few weeks of this year, shoring up their ability to meet coming obligations.

For example, some recently issued dollar bonds from Evergrande, which pay 11.5% coupons and are due in 2023, were quoted at about 99.1 cents on the dollar on Friday, according to FactSet data. Five-year bonds in rival Kaisa Group Holdings, issued in January, were quoted at 96.8 cents on the dollar. A brief selloff in some sector bonds began in late January but largely retraced within two weeks.

The strong performance also reflects a widespread belief that Chinese authorities could offer extra support to an economically significant sector if needed. "The government will be pulling whatever levers they can to help this industry through this crisis," said Charles Macgregor, head of Asia at Lucror Analytics, a credit-analysis firm. Mr. Macgregor said home purchases should recover as life returns to normal in the second quarter.

Freddy Wong, head of Asia Pacific fixed income at Invesco, said: "We didn't see a major selloff as the market is expecting incremental policy support as the situation settles down in the coming days and months."

Given the importance of a healthy property sector to China's economy, Mr. Wong said the government could take measures such as cutting down-payment requirements for home buyers and easing restrictions for firms on buying land for future development.

Some existing moves should help developers' finances. Local governments have stepped in with a variety of short-term measures, including tax relief, easier bank-loan approvals, and allowing developers to extend project delivery dates, according to research from Lucror.

Authorities are giving developers more leeway to borrow in foreign currencies, something the state usually controls tightly.

Fed Cuts Rates Amid Virus Fears --- Stocks, bond yields fall after central bank takes biggest emergency action since '08 crisis

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve executed an emergency half-percentage-point rate cut and markets slid, reflecting fears the coronavirus epidemic is raising recession risks for the U.S. and global economies.

The Fed reduced the federal-funds rate to a range between 1% and 1.25% in the first rate change in between scheduled Fed policy meetings since the 2008 financial crisis. Stock markets fell anyway. Major market indexes declined around 3% and the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury dipped below 1% for the first time as investors sought havens.

The central bank has typically reserved such moves for times when the economic outlook has quickly darkened, as in early 2001 and early 2008, when the U.S. economy was heading into recession.

Recession risks have risen enough to "warrant a Federal Reserve shock-and-awe approach," said Tiffany Wilding, an economist at Pacific Investment Management Co.

The market's moves Tuesday showed the extent to which investors worry the central bank can't on its own prevent a drop-off in confidence and spending without a commanding response from public-health authorities and other government agencies.

The rate cut was approved unanimously by the Fed's rate-setting committee, which met by videoconference on Monday night. In a statement, officials held out the prospect of additional stimulus by pledging to "act as appropriate" to support the economy.

Fed officials moved to prevent a pullback in credit availability to households and businesses that could amplify any slowdown in U.S. growth, especially if steps to mitigate the spread of the virus -- school and business closures, canceled public events and changed social behavior, broadly speaking -- curtail spending and depress hiring.

"The virus and measures being taken to contain it will weigh on economic activity here and abroad for some time," Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a news conference Tuesday.

The Fed's response shows how policy makers are bracing for greater economic distress from a contagious, flulike virus than seemed possible just a week ago.

In China, where nearly 3,000 people have died since the initial outbreak there, steps to contain its spread prompted steep declines in production. The coronavirus has infected more than 10,000 people outside China.

The epidemic roiled global financial markets last week amid signs containment efforts were jeopardized by new clusters in Italy, Iran and South Korea. Stocks posted their largest weekly losses since the 2008 financial crisis. Commodity prices fell, signaling a hit to global demand, and long-term U.S. government-bond yields reached record lows, reflecting lower growth expectations and investors seeking havens.

"The concern was that by the time they got to the meeting, things could have spiraled far enough that they would have a much bigger problem," said William English, a former senior Fed economist who now teaches at Yale University, referring to the Fed's scheduled March 17-18 policy meeting.

Positive test results for infections in the U.S. last weekend further raised the prospect of changes to behaviors that could lead to a drop in consumer spending, especially travel, tourism and entertainment.

Even if any shock is temporary, there are big unknowns over how long it will last and how deep output might decline. While an interest-rate cut won't address the cause of the downturn, Mr. Powell said he hoped it could soften damage to spending and confidence, stem financial-market disruptions and speed a recovery once any epidemic is under control.

"A rate cut will not reduce the rate of infection. It won't fix a broken supply chain. We get that," Mr. Powell said. "But we do believe that our action will provide a meaningful boost to the economy."

When the Fed cut rates three times last year, officials characterized those moves as an insurance policy against the risk of a global slowdown amplified by the U.S.-China trade war. Because the source of the latest shock isn't primarily economic, it could be more difficult for interest-rate policy to buoy consumer spending and confidence.

"Finance didn't start this thing. It's not the Asian debt crisis. It's not a currency crisis, a mortgage crisis. It's not from Fed policy being too tight," said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at research firm TS Lombard.

Mr. Blitz said it was reasonable to expect a short but swift downturn that would reverse by the summer, once the impact of the virus fades. But he added it was difficult to tell if other fissures in the economy might now surface after an 11-year rally in the stock market accompanied by a corporate-lending boom, all underwritten by lower interest rates.

"The risk is that whenever any recession takes hold, a different reality can emerge from what caused it once unaccounted-for excesses underlying the U.S. economy are laid bare," he said.

A separate risk is that the Fed's response won't be effective without a robust response by public-health authorities that maintains confidence in the nation's ability to contain or mitigate the spread of illness.

Even then, steps to limit outbreaks could lead to changes in social behavior that temporarily depresses spending and curtails hiring. That could lead weak businesses to fail and distressed households to fall behind on monthly payments.

"Right now the public health response is the most important. How effective are they treating people?" said Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist who is now economic-policy director at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a liberal think tank. "The Fed is not going to be the lead policy lever."

President Trump in recent days called on the Fed to cut rates and said he was disappointed the central bank didn't do more on Tuesday, repeating his longstanding preference for U.S. borrowing costs to be lower than other advanced economies, including those with negative rates.

Mr. English said while he was confident the Fed wasn't being swayed by political pressure, there is a risk that the central bank's credibility suffers because not everyone will see it that way.

After Tuesday's cut, investors expected the Fed would lower rates again in the coming weeks, including at the March meeting.

Fed officials repeatedly said last year it would be important to act aggressively at the first sign of a downturn in spending or hiring because they have less room to counteract a recession by cutting rates.

Fed officials are likely to look for evidence that businesses not directly affected by the virus are seeing a weakening of demand as they plot their next move. "Are households and businesses hunkering down to see how this goes? If they see that, the Fed would provide more accommodation," Mr. English said.

Minnesota Resorts Are On Thin Ice --- Slush forces new ways to reach fishing spots

LAKE WINNIBIGOSHISH, Minn. -- Tyler Croaker was cutting a new road for his family's ice-fishing resort last week, when he felt the front of his snowplow begin to sink under the ice on the frozen lake. He jammed on his brakes and got lodged about 3 1/2 miles from shore and 15 feet to 30 feet from the bottom.

"It just broke through," he said of the 1-ton truck's V-shaped snowplow. Instead of a deep chunk of ice, a thin layer covered a couple of feet of thick slush, into which the truck's plow sank. "It's the problem all over the lake."

In Northern Minnesota, ice-fishing is big business. Normally, resorts plow fluffy snow off several feet of solid ice, to create vast networks of roads for anglers to use.

This year, early snows blanketed the ice before it was thick enough to drive on and eventually got so heavy that the ice cracked, just about killing the season. The bad conditions forced resorts to cancel reservations, ask for low-interest state loans and call on every bit of ingenuity at their disposal to salvage what they could.

Since anglers' trucks couldn't go on the ice, some resorts used small SUVs with tracks instead of wheels to ferry guests to fishing spots, dubbing the service "Uber on the Ice." Others used suburban-style snowblowers to clear paths that allowed anglers to walk across a thin frozen layer on top of about two feet of slush.

Some simply battled on, plowing a truck-length or two on the crust, until their vehicle broke through. They would then pull the vehicle out, wait a day or two for the cleared area to freeze over, and then drive over that frozen spot until they got stuck again.

"I've never seen anything like this," said Tyler's dad, Roger Croaker, 49, who has worked at Nodak Lodge in Bena, Minn., for 31 years and owned it since 2005. His business is down 75% for the season, which ends in mid-March -- a time that makes up about 40% of his yearly revenue.

When Tyler, 31, got stuck, he calmly called his dad, who drove to the rescue over bumpy ice roads in his half-ton pickup. After six or seven attempts, Roger finally pulled the bigger vehicle free of the slushy hole.

Around Thanksgiving, most resorts were celebrating an early freeze, with about a foot of solid ice. Then a series of storms began dumping snow that blanketed the ice in a five-county region from Park Rapids to Kabetogoma, cutting off further freezing of that bottom layer for the rest of the season.

The worst blow came just after Christmas, when about 15 inches of heavy, wet snow was too much for the ice at the bottom of the pile. It cracked under the weight, allowing water to seep up and create a slushy mess -- a rare occurrence so late in the season, when the ice is usually thick and strong.

Most resorts were booked solid in January, the real heart of the season, when anglers would come to catch fish such as Northern Pike and Walleye. Resort owners canceled reservations and posted on social media to turn away day visitors who pay an entrance fee to drive their vehicles onto the frozen roads -- which would normally extend 20 miles to 30 miles across the lakes for many resorts.

"People want to fish so bad. We were getting 180 and 200 phone calls a day... How else do you make it through a Minnesota winter?" said Kim Leonhardt, 47, who owns High Banks Resort with her husband, Rick, 49. The top layer of slush began to freeze but was nowhere near strong enough to support a snowplow. So High Banks used an armada of tracked SUVs and even a re-purposed van to ferry fishing fans onto the lake.

Still, with limited access during the best ice fishing of the season, business at High Banks is off 40%. The resort counts on ice fishing for about half of its yearly revenue.

Chad Mertz, at the Pines Resort & Campground, had positioned six fishing houses about 2 miles offshore before the post-Christmas storm. He was determined to build a road to them before they sank into the slush. With snow still falling on the thin layer of ice on top of the slush, his plan was to clear what he could to expose the slush to the cold air and allow it to freeze. It was a grind.

At one point, he got four of his trucks trapped between cracks on the ice. The whole crew had to walk home. "It was cold," he said.

On nearby Leech Lake, Adventure North Resort had better luck. The resort set up ice-fishing houses just a quarter of a mile offshore. Instead of using heavier equipment, they got out a small snowblower and kept a path cleared for people to walk out to them.

They ended up having one of their best Januarys, said Shay Fortier, who owns the resort with her husband, Steve Krogen. She said when they took over the resort 19 years ago, a small snowblower was all the equipment they could afford. "We were returning to our roots," she said.

By mid-February, a cold snap was able to penetrate through the slush and snow, and most resorts began making progress creating roads.

Jim and Kathy Mahon of Rochester, Minn., had been forced to head north to Lake of the Woods to get their ice-fishing fix earlier in the season. Last week, they sat sipping beer at the bar of the High Banks after catching more than 100 fish on Lake Winnie, as locals call it.

Mr. Mahon admitted his wife was the real fisher, having caught 61 perch to his 41. She had also won $1 side bets on first fish and biggest fish, Mr. Mahon said.

"You are allowed to use two poles, but they were biting so fast, you only had time to use one," Ms. Mahon said.

Banking & Finance: Rate Cut Opens Opportunities for Borrowers to Save

The Federal Reserve cut its short-term benchmark rate by half a percentage point Tuesday. The timing of this rate cut, which comes in between the Fed's scheduled policy meeting, hasn't occurred since the 2008 financial crisis.

This lowers the federal-funds rate to a range between 1% and 1.25%.

Last year, the Fed cut rates three times to keep the U.S. economy moving amid slowing global growth and trade tensions. This year, disruptions from the coronavirus epidemic has unsettled global financial markets, with policy makers preparing for the economic fallout from the spread of the virus. The Fed's next scheduled meeting is March 17-18.

Interest rates affect the cost of borrowing, so falling interest rates can ripple through the cost of mortgages, the interest earned on savings accounts and more. Below, a few things to watch for:

Mortgages

The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 3.45%, according to Freddie Mac. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note -- which has hit record lows in recent days -- is used as a benchmark for different types of loans, including mortgages.

Falling interest rates could also mean it is a good time to consider refinancing. With rates trending down, whether it makes sense to refinance a mortgage now comes down to a host of personal factors. Black Knight Inc., a technology and data firm, reported that refinancing activity has nearly doubled over the past three quarters.

The Fed's previous rate cuts sparked a spending streak among U.S. households, including boosting the mortgage market to its highest level since the financial crisis.

Auto loans

Auto loans have fixed interest rates, which are pegged to Treasury yields, but the falling interest rates won't predict what dealers and lenders can charge for your auto loan. At the end of February, the average rate on a five-year new car loan was 4.56%, according to Bankrate.com.

If you're considering buying a new car or trading up, pay attention to car prices and your existing debt load: Many Americans are now taking out auto loans that last longer than six years, according to Experian PLC, and buying new cars with negative equity.

High-yield savings accounts and CDs

The interest rates offered on savings accounts and many certificates of deposit move with the federal-funds rate.

According to the FDIC, the average annual percentage yield on a one-year CD is 0.48%, and firms are continuing to cut rates on high-yield offerings. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s Marcus account has dropped to 1.7%, and robo advisers Betterment and Wealthfront have also lowered the rates on their saving products to 1.84% and 1.78%, respectively.

Credit cards

A decline in interest rates can sometimes affect the average credit card annual percentage rate, or APR, which is pegged to the prime rate.

However, The Wall Street Journal found that even as interest rates fall, some credit card rates are going up. This is because popular, generous rewards and points programs are costing banks more, so many are raising rates to cover such costs.

According to WalletHub's January report of more than 1,000 credit-card offers, the average APR for those with good credit at the end of 2019 was 20.68%.

Student loans

Falling interest rates may benefit you in other areas of your financial life, but your student loans, unfortunately, are less likely to be affected.

If you have private education loans, you could pay less interest and could consider refinancing. Those rates are tied to the London interbank offered rate.

For those with federal loans, interest rates are already set every May, based on a 10-year Treasury note auction. These interest rates are fixed for the entire life of the loan.

The rate for direct subsidized and unsubsidized undergraduate loans disbursed between now and June 30 is 4.53%. So while this latest drop in interest rates won't currently affect those with federal student loans, next year it could have an impact on loans distributed for the 2020-21 academic year.

Wall Street and President Trump have begged, admonished and tweeted for the Federal Reserve to come to the economy's rescue. Tuesday morning, the Fed obliged.

But their faith is likely to prove misplaced. The Fed cannot save the U.S. economy from the coronavirus, for two reasons.

First, it can't restart factories that are missing parts as the virus disrupts supply chains, nor can it persuade worried vacationers to fly. Second, and potentially more important, central banks are losing their grip on the business cycle.

The Fed had little interest-rate ammunition with which to boost growth even before Tuesday's cut; the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan effectively have none. The world is facing its first big shock in an era when central banks are no longer omnipotent.

The good news is that the same factors that make monetary policy less potent make fiscal policy even more so. With investors rushing to buy government bonds and driving yields down, the U.S. and other rich governments can borrow all they need to fight the risk of both pandemic and recession risk.

U.S. recessions have historically been precipitated by rising inflation and interest rates, collapsing asset prices, or both. Central banks responded by lowering interest rates and, if necessary, buying assets such as bonds or making direct loans to impaired banks, as they did during the global financial crisis in 2008 to 2009.

Since that crisis, structural factors such as low productivity growth, aging populations and risk aversion kept economic growth and inflation low around the world, making it difficult if not impossible for central banks to raise rates. The ECB and Bank of Japan cut theirs below zero. The Fed raised its short-term interest rate target to between 2.25% and 2.5% in 2018, then had to cut it three times last year, to between 1.5% and 1.75%, because of a global slowdown and trade war.

On Tuesday, it cut its benchmark rate by a half percentage point.

Central banks hoped that with time, inflation and growth would firm enough for interest rates to return to some normal, positive level. The risk was always that some shock would come along to short-circuit that process.

Epidemics historically haven't been disruptive enough to affect gross domestic product much.

That probably won't be true this time. Supply-side disruptions of pandemics have been compounded by demand-side effects: precautionary measures by the authorities, employers and individuals to avoid infection.

These behavioral effects account for 80% to 90% of the economic hit from epidemics, according to work by Warwick McKibbin, an economist at Australian National University. As with a biological or other terrorism threat, "A large number of people would feel at risk at the onset of a pandemic, even if their actual risk of dying from the disease is low," he and a co-author wrote in a report for the Brookings Institution this week.

Goldman Sachs estimates 10% to 15% of U.S. GDP consists of services such as entertainment, restaurants, church services and public transportation that would suffer if people limit interaction and avoid large gatherings. Goldman also estimates the disease will knock roughly 3 percentage points off annualized growth in the next quarter, with these demand-side effects accounting for almost half.

The Fed can't offset these effects, said Jan Hatzius, Goldman's chief economist.

He said the Fed can help cushion the hit to demand when employees lose their jobs because of supply disruptions or consumers staying home, or spending and investment retreat due to lower stock prices and uncertainty. Lower mortgage rates, for example, could add some construction jobs, "but it's all pretty small."

Another risk: If the Fed lowers interest rates close to zero to deal with the current crisis it will, like the ECB and Bank of Japan now, have no rate ammunition to deal with the next one.

Nellie Liang, a former Fed economist now at Brookings, said the central bank can take other actions, such as reminding banks they can borrow from the Fed's discount window if they need funds to help their customers, and dissuade them from foreclosing on customers who miss a payment because of the virus.

But the real firepower lies with fiscal policy. Congress is working on a $7 billion to $8 billion package to combat the virus. The U.S. could easily borrow more: Congress authorized $65 billion in recovery spending after the 9/11 attacks, $100 billion after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and $51 billion after Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

President Trump has suggested a payroll-tax cut. On Monday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren proposed $400 billion of stimulus -- roughly 2% of GDP.

Whether that much is needed is unclear. But Ms. Warren is targeting fiscal firepower in a way monetary policy cannot: the Massachusetts Democrat, who is running for president, would cover the bills of patients being tested or treated for the virus and increase health-center capacity.

Some service-sector workers might stay on the job even if they are infected, because they can't afford to stay home. Ms. Warren proposes paying emergency sick leave to anyone with symptoms, or who has a dependent with symptoms, so they can stay home.

That is a twofer: It offers protection against recession and epidemic at the same time.

Tennessee Twisters Kill at Least 25

Tornadoes ripped through Tennessee on Tuesday, killing at least 25 people as the twisters carved a path through scenic mountain communities and razed venues in a trendy Nashville neighborhood.

A line of storms began barreling across Tennessee on Monday, spawning three tornadoes in the middle part of the state while many residents slept, according to the National Weather Service. They smashed homes and businesses and left tens of thousands of residents without power.

Gov. Bill Lee said 19 of the deaths, including some children, took place in Putnam County, about 80 miles east of Nashville and home to parks and waterfalls.

Putnam County Mayor Randy Porter said one possible reason so many people died is that the tornado struck suddenly in the middle of the night when people were asleep and might not have heard warning sirens and cellphone alerts.

"It hit so fast," Mr. Porter said. "A lot of folks didn't have time to take shelter."

The remainder of the deaths were in the counties of Wilson, Benton and Davidson, home to Nashville. One twister cut through Nashville, hitting neighborhoods including Germantown, an affluent area with upscale apartments and restaurants, and East Nashville, a section with popular bars and music spots.

"It is heartbreaking. We have had loss of life all across the state," Mr. Lee said. "We're doing everything that we can to respond to this."

Emergency officials answered more than 400 calls and transported about 160 people to hospitals, said Nashville Fire Chief William Swann. At least 48 buildings were destroyed, he said. About 73,000 people were without power in several counties, according to the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency.

Residents described a ravaged landscape of downed power lines, collapsed homes and businesses and debris strewn across the streets. Local officials warned residents to stay off the roads as emergency crews assessed the damage.

"Nashville is hurting, and our community has been devastated," Nashville Mayor John Cooper said. "Together, we will get through this and come out stronger."

In East Nashville, Matt Niehoff said he woke up a little before 1 a.m. local time Tuesday to what sounded like a low-flying jet, then heard glass shattering in his house and the wind whipping as the tornado tore through. The twister blew in a front window and ripped the roofs off the front porch and garage.

Outside, thick old trees that lined his street toppled and snapped, one landing on a neighbor's roof, said Mr. Niehoff, 36 years old. Blocks away, in the bustling Five Points area, a main street was littered with debris. Some prized businesses, including a burger place, a tea house and a concert venue, were damaged or destroyed.

"It's hard to take in the severity of it," Mr. Niehoff said.

Schools were closed Tuesday due to damage, and state offices were shut in at least eight counties, TEMA said.

The extreme weather came as Tennessee was one of 14 states holding primaries on Super Tuesday. Voting still took place, but some polling locations in affected counties were closed or delayed in opening, Secretary of State Tre Hargett said. His office, as well as the Tennessee Democratic Party, were directing voters to alternate locations.

After the state party sued to extend voting hours, a state judge in Davidson County ordered elections officials to keep all polling locations in the county open until 8 p.m. local time and five large stations open until 10 p.m. Mr. Lee said the state deployed generators to some polling stations without power. "We're going to make it possible for as many folks as we can to vote," he said.

Josh Westerhold, a 39-year-old East Nashville resident, said his regular polling station was closed because of the storm. As a result, he went to cast a ballot at a community center that was taking in voters from several other precincts. On Tuesday afternoon, he was still waiting in a snaking line that he estimated would take as much as two hours.

President Trump promised support to rebuild in remarks at the National Association of Counties Legislative Conference. The president said he would visit the state Friday.

In Putnam County, emergency responders were going house to house to assess damage in the hardest-hit neighborhoods.

Sixty-five people were treated at a regional hospital for injuries, said Mr. Porter, the mayor. He said he had taken a helicopter flight in the morning to survey the area and that many homes were completely destroyed.

"It's a pretty wide path of damage," Mr. Porter said.

World News: Iran Frees Inmates to Ease Risk

TEHRAN -- Iran is temporarily releasing tens of thousands of prisoners in an attempt to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in the country's crowded prisons, as it struggles to contain one of the worst outbreaks of a disease that has killed dozens of people and infected 23 lawmakers.

More than 54,000 prisoners have gone out on furlough after testing negative for the virus, judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said on Tuesday. He indicated that several prominent Iranian political prisoners and British dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe would be allowed out.

Iran has ramped up efforts to contain the virus in recent days after accusations it was seeking to hide the extent of the outbreak. As it widens a screening campaign, the number of confirmed cases has jumped sharply, with a 56% increase to 2,336 on Tuesday from a day earlier, Health Minister Saeed Namaki said.

Mr. Namaki, whose deputy is among a score of officials to have contracted the virus, said it had claimed 11 more lives since Monday, bringing the death toll to 77 -- the highest in the world outside China.

Parliament sessions have been suspended after 23 out of 290 lawmakers fell ill with the virus, deputy speaker Abdolreza Mesri was quoted as saying by the Young Journalists Club. "We advise deputies to cut their contact with people," he said. The head of Iran's emergency services has also tested positive, spokesman Mojtaba Khaledi told the Fars news agency, along with two officials on the country's medical council.

It wasn't clear whether the dead include any people in prisons, which have emerged as a flashpoint for transmission in other countries such as China.

Iran's prison population stood at about 240,000 in mid-2019, a social affairs official said.

Prisoners with long sentences or those deemed dangerous to the public aren't among those released, and some of those who were freed had to pay large sums in bail.

Citing the judiciary spokesman, Iran's ambassador to the U.K. said Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is serving a five-year sentence for her conviction on what U.K. officials say are trumped-up charges of spying, is healthy and would be granted furlough on Tuesday or Wednesday to join her family in Tehran. Her family had earlier said Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was unwell and had likely contracted the coronavirus.

It isn't clear whether three Iranian-Americans who are being held will be granted furlough as well. Lawyer Jared Genser, who represents Iranian-American Siamak Namazi, said Mr. Namazi was at risk of contracting the virus after a fellow prisoner on his ward in Evin Prison tested positive.

"Many other sick prisoners who have asked to be tested for coronavirus have had those requests denied," Mr. Genser said, describing medical facilities within the prison as rudimentary. He said prisoners had been locked down since Monday in their cells, which each hold at least 10 to 20 people. Until then, they were allowed to circulate within their wards and eat meals together, as well as congregate in the library, exercise facilities and a television lounge.

Iranian authorities couldn't be reached for comment.

Even with prisoners confined to their cells, the risk of transmission remains high because they must pass through a common hallway to use the restroom.

Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. has set aside $40 million to resolve foreign bribery probes centered on its business in China.

The Los Angeles-based multilevel-marketing company is in negotiations with the U.S. Justice Department and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve the investigations, which focus on its compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the company said in its annual report.

Herbalife said it couldn't predict the exact timing of a possible settlement. The provision, which represents the cost the company could incur as a result of any settlement, was recorded in the annual report on Feb. 18.

The sum "doesn't indicate where we might ultimately land," Alex Amezquita, a senior vice president of finance and strategic planning at Herbalife, said during an investor call. "It is simply an artifact of the discussions that have continued to progress."

Last year, two former Herbalife executives, both Chinese nationals, were indicted in the U.S. on criminal and civil charges of violating the FCPA, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.

U.S. News: Court Weighs Consumer Agency's Structure

WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court indicated Tuesday that it may curtail the independence of an eight-year-old agency created to protect consumers from abusive financial practices, but showed little inclination to eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau outright, as a California law firm had asked.

The case centers on the bureau's structure: Its director is nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate for a five-year term, but can only be removed for "inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office." Conservatives argue that limit impinges on the president's constitutional power over the executive branch, which they say must include authority to remove officials at will.

Lower courts have upheld the CFPB's structure, citing Supreme Court precedents that rejected challenges to other executive-branch agencies that Congress partially insulated from political interventions, including the Federal Trade Commission and, under a now-expired law, independent counsels.

Kannon Shanmugam, representing Seila Law LLC of Orange, Calif., which is under investigation by the agency for abusive telemarketing practices in its debt-relief business, told the justices that such rulings shouldn't be extended to cover the CFPB. He argued the bureau's structure was so flawed that the agency should be shut down and, at minimum, the court void the civil investigative demand the CFPB served on his client.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had a sharp response to the plaintiff's argument that the director's power infringes on the civil liberty of those targeted by the agency's enforcement actions. "Now whose liberty are we speaking of?" she said. "What about the consumers? I mean, Congress passed this law so that the consumers would be better protected against financial fraud."

The Trump administration refused to defend the CFPB structure, and sent Solicitor General Noel Francisco to argue that the president must be free to fire the director. The Supreme Court then appointed a renowned conservative lawyer, Paul Clement, to defend the structure of the CFPB, an agency conceived by Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. The Democratic-majority House of Representatives, in turn, sent its general counsel to back Mr. Clement's argument.

The outcome, however, may have been presaged in January 2018 when Justice Brett Kavanaugh, then a federal appeals judge, filed a dissent in a separate case upholding the CFPB's configuration. The dissent contended that the for-cause requirement for removing the director marred a constitutional design that helped "safeguard liberty" by assigning the president "authority to supervise, direct, and remove at will subordinate officers in the Executive Branch."

The remedy, he wrote then, was eliminating the for-cause provision, but otherwise leaving the CFPB intact.

At Tuesday's session, Justice Kavanaugh elaborated on his concerns. "The problem really reveals itself," he said, when a new president is stuck with a holdover CFPB director who may have "a wildly different conception of consumer financial protection."

President Trump, who has sought to relax some consumer protections pursued by his predecessor, faced that situation until Obama-appointee Richard Cordray stepped down as CFPB director in November 2017.

The term of the current director, Kathy Kraninger, expires in 2023, meaning she would be running the CFPB well into the next presidential term unless she were to resign or be removed for bad behavior.

The justices focused less on the case's near-term political consequences, though, than their different understandings of the constitutional structure.

Justice Elena Kagan rebutted the focus on removal authority that is central to the conservative theory of the president's exclusive power over the executive branch.

"This is a Constitution that doesn't say anything about removal," she said. "Indeed, it doesn't say anything very much about the structure or organization of the government in general," suggesting the framers left that to the elected branches to decide.

U.S. News: States Can Charge Immigrant ID-Theft

A divided Supreme Court on Tuesday boosted the ability of states to prosecute illegal immigrants for identity theft when they provide false Social Security numbers or other information on job applications.

The court, in a 5-4 opinion by Justice Samuel Alito, reinstated convictions obtained by Kansas prosecutors against three restaurant workers for using other people's Social Security numbers on forms given to their employers.

The central question in the case, Kansas v. Garcia, was whether such state prosecutions were barred by a provision of federal immigration law that says any information submitted with federal work-authorization forms can't be used for state law-enforcement purposes.

Justice Alito, writing for a conservative majority, said the answer was no. The mere fact that Kansas law on identity theft overlapped with federal law "does not even begin to make a case" that the state's prosecutorial efforts should be pre-empted, he wrote.

"In the present cases, there is certainly no suggestion that the Kansas prosecutions frustrated any federal interests," Justice Alito said. Joining him in the majority were Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.

The Trump administration had sided with Kansas in the case, arguing that Congress never meant to carve out an immigration-related exception that would prevent states from enforcing their own identity-theft laws.

In dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer, writing for the court's liberal wing, said U.S. immigration law gave federal authorities the sole responsibility to police fraud committed to obtain eligibility to work.

The law "reserves to the federal government -- and thus takes from the states -- the power to prosecute people for misrepresenting material information in an effort to convince their employer that they are authorized to work in this country," Justice Breyer wrote.

Joining him in dissent were Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
The Coronavirus 'Stimulus'

The Federal Reserve has become the default doctor for whatever ails the U.S. economy, and on Tuesday the financial physician applied what it hopes will be monetary balm for the economic damage from the coronavirus. Financial markets were underwhelmed after the big rally on Monday, which may speak to the limited effect that lower interest rates can have on the supply shock of a pandemic.

The unanimous decision by the Federal Open Market Committee to cut the fed funds rate by 50 basis points to 1%-1.25% was at least bold. Perhaps more significant, the Fed also cut the rate it pays on excess reserves that banks park at the central bank by 50 basis points to 1.1%. This gives banks more of an incentive to put reserves to work in the real economy.

The theory behind the rate cut appears to be that aggressive action is the best way to send a strong message of economic insurance. Perhaps this will help consumers -- whose spending has kept the economy growing despite weak business investment -- maintain confidence in the expansion. Other central banks are also likely to follow the Fed's lead.

Will this make much of an economic difference? Count us skeptical. Financial conditions weren't tight even with a flight to the safety of U.S. Treasurys. The fall in the 10-year note to a historic low of 1% and the recent correction in stocks reflect the expectations of slower growth and thus lower corporate earnings.

But this relates mainly to the damage to global supply chains and expected limits on travel and commerce as the world tries to mitigate the rates of infection. Nobody is going to take that flight to Tokyo because the Fed is suddenly paying less on excess reserves.

The other concern is whether the Fed will have the nerve to raise rates again if the pandemic damage turns out to be less than feared. That won't be easy in an election year, and November is still eight months away. President Trump on Tuesday tweeted a demand that the Fed do more even after its 50-point cut.

The Fed's great mistake after 9/11 was that it kept rates at or near 1% for far too long even after the 2003 tax cut had the economy humming. The seeds of the housing boom and bust were sown. The housing market has begun to take off again in recent months, and in the near term that will help cushion the economy during the coronavirus panic. The trick will be not letting it get carried away into another national price spiral.

This being an election year, the political class is also starting to demand more fiscal "stimulus." Mr. Trump tweeted approval for a payroll-tax cut for workers, while Elizabeth Warren bid higher, as she always does, for a $400 billion spending bill. It's only a matter of time before Bernie Sanders raises her, and we start hearing about the fabled "Keynesian multiplier" when $1 in new spending yields $1.70 in economic benefit. If Mr. Trump falls for that, he'd be embracing Joe Bidenomics.

We tried the temporary payroll-tax cut idea in the slow growth Obama era, reducing the worker portion of the levy to 4.2% from 6.2% of salary. It took effect in January 2011, but the unemployment rate stayed above 9% for most of the rest of that year.

Temporary tax cuts put more money in peoples' pockets and can give a short-term lift to the GDP statistics. But the growth effect quickly vanishes because it doesn't permanently change the incentive to save and invest. Workers understand their financial circumstances haven't fundamentally changed and act accordingly.

The main redeeming quality of a payroll-tax cut is that it isn't new spending and might offer a refuge for politicians who feel they need to "do something" in an election year. But unless it is permanent, it won't be a stimulus for the economy -- and probably not for the election.

Shifting Story: City Halts Order to Shrink a Tower

New York City officials Tuesday halted a judge's order that a developer stop construction and demolish much of a 55-story condominium tower in Manhattan.

The February ruling said the developer of the project known as 200 Amsterdam had to shrink the building because it violated the city's zoning code.

Under the ruling, the building would have to shrink to less than 80,000 square feet and lose perhaps 40 stories in height, said George Janes, a zoning consultant, who worked with opponents of the project.

The ruling sent shock waves through the real-estate industry. Developers worried it could spark challenges to other completed or nearly completed buildings where developers had already spent hundreds of millions of dollars.

New York's real-estate community was already feeling it had become a target of New York City and state lawmakers, who last year imposed higher transfer taxes and passed new tenant protection laws.

In this case, the city came to one developer's defense when city lawyers notified the court that they had filed an appeal in the 200 Amsterdam case. Under state law, when New York City is a defendant, it is entitled to an automatic stay of a ruling against it, lawyers said.

The case will now be considered by an appellate panel and could face a review by the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals.

The ruling by Justice Franc Perry of state Supreme Court in Manhattan overturned a series of decisions by the city's buildings department, as well as a review panel, the Board of Standards and Appeals, that had upheld the building permit issued in 2017 to the developer, SJP Properties.

The 668-foot-tall building, at 200 Amsterdam Ave., has already topped out, and many of the 112 condominiums there are on the market. Construction on the site has been continuing, despite the threat of partial demolition.

"We will continue to vigorously appeal this ruling in partnership with the City and are confident that the facts and justice will prevail," said a spokeswoman for SJP Properties.

The real-estate community was quick to criticize the judge's ruling.

"If a specious lawsuit can reverse a nearly complete project, developers and lenders will lose faith that the City's regulatory framework can actually be trusted," James Whelan, the president of an industry group, the Real Estate Board of New York.

The case turned on an arcane issue in the zoning code: how city tax lots can be combined into larger zoning lots that allow for the transfer of building rights to a new construction site.

Developers routinely hire zoning consultants to research past advisory opinions and interpretations by the buildings department to find ways to maximize the height and bulk of new buildings -- along with potential profits.

At 200 Amsterdam Ave., the zoning lot was assembled from a collection of partial tax lots left out of other construction projects on the same block. A 1977 buildings-department memo allowed these partial tax lots to be combined into a single building site.

The permit application for the Amsterdam Avenue building shows a spiderlike network of skinny partial lots. The combination allowed the construction of a 370,000-square foot building.

Not About Roe v. Wade

The Supreme Court on Wednesday will hear its first abortion-related case during the Trump Presidency. Cue the consternation. No, the Court's conservatives aren't about to overturn Roe v. Wade. But they do have an opportunity to return to first judicial principles and correct the Court's mistake of four years ago.

Abortion providers in June Medical Services v. Russo are challenging a 2014 Louisiana law that requires them to obtain admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles. The law was intended to root out fly-by-night abortion shops and applies the same state licensing standards to abortion providers as to surgical ambulatory centers.

After Antonin Scalia's death in 2016, a 5-3 majority of the four liberals and Justice Anthony Kennedy struck down a similar Texas law in Hellerstedt. The majority said the safety benefits didn't justify the potential increased burden on women seeking an abortion. Justice Samuel Alito wrote a dissent joined by John Roberts and Clarence Thomas, and now the Court has two new Justices and a full bench.

The Justices agreed to hear the challenge to Louisiana's law and, importantly, they also chose to consider whether abortion providers have legal standing to sue on behalf of women seeking abortions. Third-party standing is a judicial innovation advanced by a 1976 plurality in Singleton in the Burger Court era. This has let providers challenge sundry abortion regulations without having to show injury to a specific woman. In an amicus brief, the state of Texas notes that providers have challenged laws requiring sterilized instruments, a working toilet and caps on ultrasound fees.

As the state of Louisiana argues, the law offers no impediments to women vindicating their abortion rights in court if they believe they have been injured by the law. Many law firms represent low-income women pro bono. Yet women aren't the plaintiffs in this case.

Abortion providers are suing instead to avoid increased compliance burdens. Four of the six doctors employed by clinics challenging the Louisiana law had obtained hospital admitting privileges in the past. Five did not have privileges at the time the law was passed. Three later didn't make a good-faith effort to do so, another retired, and one had no medical-school training to perform abortions. After examining this factual record, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Louisiana law.

Liberals are warning about a Roe slippery slope if the Court overturns Singleton or Hellerstedt. But a six Justice majority in Kowalski (2004) rejected third-party standing for attorneys seeking to vindicate the legal rights of hypothetical future clients. The same principle should apply to abortion providers.

As Justice Thomas noted in his Hellerstedt dissent, "When the wrong party litigates a case, we end up resolving disputes that make for bad law." Dismissing the challenge to the Louisiana law would send a clear message to lower courts and liberals who are trying to extend third-party standing to other controversies.

Many U.S. Cities See Downturn at Hand --- Booming regions mask fiscal weakness in places tethered to shrinking industries

HARVEY, Ill. -- Christopher Clark was elected mayor last year, pledging to cut business taxes and lower water bills. They were popular goals that seemed in reach given that city revenues had been rising almost every year since the recession.

On taking office, Mr. Clark figured out the city's progress had stalled. Property tax collections were down, and businesses were cutting jobs. A fall in city revenue, coupled with growing debt payments, meant there would be no relief from business taxes or water bills.

"We just have to figure out ways to do more with less," Mr. Clark said, a mantra surfacing in dozens of U.S. cities.

A decade of growth in the U.S. economy allowed cities to patch fiscal holes left by the financial crisis and recession. A surprising number now see signs of trouble.

The proportion of American cities expecting general-fund revenue to drop more than 3% when the books close on the 2019 fiscal year increased to 27% from 17% in fiscal 2018, when adjusted for inflation. That is one of the findings from a Wall Street Journal analysis of data collected from 478 U.S. municipalities by the National League of Cities, an advocacy group.

The total general-fund revenue reported by these cities -- locales that span the U.S. -- is expected to be lower in fiscal 2019 than in fiscal 2018, adjusted for inflation, the first such dip in seven years. The cities range in population from the low tens of thousands to the millions.

General-fund revenue typically represents dollars not earmarked for a specific purpose, a flexible pot of money to spend on public goods and services.

"It's a big deal when you have this many cities concerned about the near-term future," said Matt Fabian, a partner with municipal bond research firm Municipal Market Analytics. "Maybe they don't hire new police as quickly as they did before. . .Maybe they put off plans to address the big challenges that cities are facing like pensions and climate change."

American cities are generally doing better than rural communities, buoyed by the U.S. expansion. Yet the boom in such metropolitan areas as Denver, Salt Lake City and Nashville, Tenn., masked fiscal weakness in cities tied to manufacturing and other shrinking industries.

Fallout from the coronavirus disease on the U.S. economy and city budgets is another potential setback. In the past week, New York City has held daily meetings of pension advisers, and California put out a warning to prospective municipal bond investors.

All regions of the U.S. contains cities that are losing fiscal ground, the Journal found. In the West, 29% of cities expected declines of more than 3% in general-fund revenue in fiscal 2019, up from 18% in fiscal 2018. In the South, the proportion of cities reporting a revenue drop went to 20% from 16%, using the same measure; in the Northeast, it went to 31% from 14%.

On the flip side, nearly 60% of U.S. cities reported general-fund revenue increases that outpaced inflation in fiscal 2018. Yet even in this group, expectations are fading: Cities expecting similar growth in fiscal 2019 fell to 53%.

Stagnating or declining revenues are easier to manage for growing cities in the West and South. In New England and the Midwest, many places are struggling with losses of population as well as industry.

Job losses hit hardest in cities that have been barely keeping pace with expenses during the recovery. Tighter household budgets translate into smaller sales-tax allocations. City populations shrink when residents follow jobs out of town, hurting home prices, commerce and property tax collections.

The general-revenue declines struck earliest in the Midwest, where combined inflation-adjusted city revenues fell by 4.3% in the 2018 fiscal year from 2017, the Journal found.

Over the 12 months ending in November, 28 metropolitan areas in the Midwest lost manufacturing jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, including Detroit, Youngstown, Ohio, and Louisville, Ky.

Some losses stem from the shifting global economy and disruptions from the U.S.-China trade war. In Blue Springs, Mo., population 55,000, an auto-parts manufacturer last fall announced it was closing its plant to save costs, a loss of more than 150 local jobs. Operations are moving to Monterrey, Mexico, a company executive said. The city expects general-fund revenue to fall slightly for the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30.

Many cities operating with little fiscal breathing room have been sweating to cover day-to-day city operations under the burden of growing retirement costs and past borrowing.

Bond and pension liabilities owed by roughly 1,000 U.S. cities ballooned nearly 25% to about $500 billion in 2018 compared with 2013, according to an analysis of data from Merritt Research Services. Roughly 50 million Americans live in citiesthat are devoting at least a fifth of annual spending to debt.

As many as 20 of the largest U.S. cities could face either service cuts or tax increases to cover the costs of pensions, retiree health care and interest on bond debt, according to a J.P. Morgan Asset Management study. New Haven, Conn., and Jersey City, N.J., for instance, raised taxes last year to cover such expenses.

Few municipalities are in a deeper hole for their size than Harvey, a city of 24,641 that was founded in 1891 by a lumber tycoon.

Harvey, located about 17 miles south of downtown Chicago, grew into an industrial center, producing car mufflers, farm and mining equipment and military airplane parts. When Mr. Clark, the new mayor, was born a half-century ago, the population was nearly 35,000. Roughly 46% of employed men over 16 worked in manufacturing, according to the 1970 census.

"Everybody had a nice fenced-off yard," Mr. Clark recalled of his boyhood neighborhood. "There was either a Cadillac or a Lincoln in front." The local Dixie Square Mall had more than 50 stores, including Woolworth and Montgomery Ward.

Mr. Clark drove a forklift before getting a scholarship to law school. He opened his law practice 10 years ago in a former jewelry store downtown.

Factories closed in the 1980s, taking jobs with them. By 1990, nearly 15% of men ages 25 to 54 were unemployed, according to the census. Dixie Square Mall was demolished in 2012 after closing years earlier.

Longtime residents dispersed to other states. For years, they held annual gatherings, called "Harvey Days," in Florida, California and Arizona. The reunions drew thousands of people who had lived, worked or attended high school in Harvey, said Carl Durnavich, who helped organize many of them.

After the financial crisis, city services hit bottom. Broken streetlights went unrepaired, and the fire department was down to one working fire engine. Firefighters who couldn't fit aboard, crammed into a pickup truck, said Ron DeYoung, president of International Association of Fire Fighters Local 471.

The economic recovery finally hit town. One of the city's remaining manufacturers, Sterling Site Access Solutions, which straddles Harvey and the adjacent town of Phoenix, Ill., added roughly 100 jobs between 2013 and 2018. About half were skilled manufacturing positions. The local plant of an international lubricant-maker also expanded its workforce.

In 2018, the city's total private-sector jobs ticked up for the first time in six years, according to a state report. Then, the following year, job numbers fell, eroding most of the gains.

Voters selected Mr. Clark, an outspoken alderman, as mayor. Local employers hailed him as an ally. In the weeks after Mr. Clark's inauguration, residents reported that some alleys had been cleared for the first time in years.

Harvey seemed poised for a turnaround. Signs of distress emerged instead. Property taxes, the city's largest revenue source, fell in the 2018 fiscal year, which ended April 30, 2018. The decline wasn't reported until an audit was completed in October.

Raising rates to make up the losses risked driving away residents and business. Sterling opened a new plant last year, but it was in Texas. Carter Sterling, the company's chief executive, said he decided to expand out of state, in part, because property taxes in Harvey and neighboring Phoenix were too high. Property owners in Harvey pay some of the highest rates in the Chicago metropolitan area, according to an analysis from the Civic Federation, a business-backed watchdog group.

David Abshire, vice president at LB Steel, a local manufacturer, said the city's property tax rates discourage new business, especially with city services falling short. Mr. Clark isn't considering lowering property taxes, he said, because Harvey needs revenue.

Mr. Abshire praised the mayor's work, but he said he was waiting for the city to raze the collapsing building across the street from LB Steel. It makes a poor impression on executives he invites to see his nearly 500,000 square-foot facility. "We have world-class customers coming here," Mr. Abshire said.

City officials said they were working on securing funds to tear down many vacant structures in town.

Decisions by Mr. Clark's predecessor, Eric Kellogg, drove up the city's bond debt to $35 million. Its liability to police and firefighter pension funds grew to $82 million. Use of some of the bond proceeds drew scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which charged the former mayor with fraud after finding the city spent investor money for a hotel project on payroll instead. In a civil settlement with the SEC, Mr. Kellogg agreed to stay out of bond deals. He didn't respond to requests for comment.

The state in 2018 began garnishing millions of dollars in city revenues to refill pension coffers. Like many cities, Harvey had long made smaller-than-needed payments to swelling pension obligations. During Mr. Kellogg's tenure, the city paid nothing into police and fire pension funds for several years, according to city reports.

Harvey has less than 33 cents on hand for every dollar of benefits it has promised retired and working police officers and about 17 cents for every dollar owed retired and working firefighters. One measure of its shrinking fortunes: The city sends paychecks to more retired firefighters than working ones.

Mr. Clark had hoped officials representing police and fire pension funds would agree to accept smaller payments over a longer period, giving the city more leeway for urgent expenses. Fund officials haven't agreed.

Bringing an economic recovery to Harvey will be a huge challenge, said City Councilwoman Shirley Drewenski, a college administrator. Her 3-bedroom house, built by her parents, was valued at $46,580 by the county assessor's office, less than what she paid for her new car.

Mr. Clark is focused on making the most of the revenue he has. The city public works department bought two new snowplows and new mowers. Some streetlights are set to be repaired with a grant for energy-saving LED lighting.

"You know that some things aren't going to happen," he said of the city's prospects "You know that you're going to live a life of hand-me-downs."

Rate Cuts No Miracle Cure --- Fed can support the economy in the fight against virus but can't lead it

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

Maybe the best thing that can be said about the Federal Reserve's interest-rate cut on Tuesday is that the central bank got it out of the way.

After all, with evidence piling up that the new coronavirus epidemic may represent the most serious threat the economy has faced since the last recession, and with economists repeatedly cutting their economic forecasts, a rate cut by the time of the Fed's meeting scheduled for later this month seemed a done deal.

Investors' apparent disappointment over a statement from Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers earlier in the day pledging to use "all appropriate policy tools" to support growth -- but not offering any concrete steps -- may have underscored the Fed's need to act. The very brief boost that the news gave to risky assets speaks volumes about what it can and can't accomplish.

In acting early, and in cutting its target range by a half a percentage point rather than just a quarter point, the Fed sends the message that it is prepared to do whatever it can to bolster the economy against the effects of the outbreak.

That includes further rate cuts and, if it ends up taking overnight rates down to zero, bond buying, "forward guidance" promises to not raise rates for a long time and other kitchen-sink measures in an attempt to stave off a recession.

But the Fed's powers are, in this particular case, muted.

With its target range on overnight rates at 1% to 1.25%, it has a limited amount of rate-cutting firepower. Historically when the Fed has faced a recession, it has cut rates by around 5 percentage points to turn things around. Low long-term interest rates -- the 10-year Treasury now yields just 1% -- makes bond buying less potent as well.

Moreover, monetary policy isn't a good tool to fight economic problems stemming from the coronavirus epidemic.

Lower rates can't fix supply-chain problems faced by companies reliant on Chinese goods, for example, or make nervous consumers book vacations to Miami.

Still, the Fed's easing move is better than nothing and the economy will be better off with them than without them. Investors, and Americans at large, should be comforted that the Fed has their back.

By acting forcefully, the Fed may also help bring home the message that while it can support the economy in the fight against the coronavirus, it can't lead it.

Outage Persists at Robinhood Online Brokerage Firm

An outage that took down popular online brokerage Robinhood Financial LLC extended into a second day Tuesday, locking customers out of the markets on a wild trading day.

Shortly after the opening bell, Robinhood said it was "experiencing downtime," as many of its 10 million users tried and failed to log in for the second day in a row. On Monday, the platform suffered a daylong outage that left customers unable to reap the benefits of a 5.1% rally in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Problems resumed soon after markets opened Tuesday and lasted about two hours. Customers were left on the sidelines when the Federal Reserve cut rates by half a percentage point to combat coronavirus fears, roiling markets.

Robinhood said it "experienced an issue with a part of our infrastructure" that allows the company's systems to properly communicate with each other. The company didn't provide any other details about the cause of the outage, though a spokesperson said no customer data, information or funds were lost.

Customers were furious. Some have demanded compensation; others have said they plan to take their money elsewhere. Robinhood said it would work to resolve customer complaints case by case.

Kanak Hyanki was eager to make a few quick trades Tuesday morning after being shut out of the market Monday. The 38-year-old Washington, D.C., resident logged in after he got an email from Robinhood saying service had been restored, yet he was unable to trade.

"If you're losing out on opportunities like this when the whole market is going up and down, then there's no point of the commission-free model," Mr. Hyanki said. "Frankly, if I get a chance, I will take my business elsewhere."

Robinhood, founded in 2012, has lured millions of users with its commission-free trades, smartphone app and easy-to-use platform. Robinhood's popularity has forced rivals Charles Schwab Corp ., TD Ameritrade Holding Corp . and E*Trade Financial Corp . to eliminate commissions.

Other online brokerages have experienced brief outages during the weeklong market swoon spurred by the worsening coronavirus epidemic. The S&P 500 wiped out $3.6 trillion in market value during the seven-day selloff between the Feb. 19 close and Friday.

Across social-media platforms throughout the past week, customers of TD Ameritrade , Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group have complained about glitches.

For traders who have weathered market ups and downs for years, the outage was reminiscent of a software bug that shut down trading of securities listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market in 2013. Yet unlike the Nasdaq incident, the rest of the world kept trading on Monday and Tuesday.

Aaron Wang, a 32-year-old product manager for a software startup in San Francisco, said he tried logging in "every few moments" throughout Monday.

He, like other traders, missed the largest percentage gain that the Dow industrials experienced since March 2009. And they weren't able to trade through Tuesday's volatility in the wake of the Fed's announcement. The Dow swung more than 1,000 points from its high to its low.

Justices Signal Curbing SEC Remedies

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Supreme Court justices Tuesday indicated they may be inclined to rein in how courts and regulators order wrongdoers to return money earned through illegal investment schemes.

In arguments, liberal and conservative justices questioned how they could narrow the remedy without quashing it outright, an alternative they appeared to reject. The Securities and Exchange Commission obtains billions of dollars in such relief every year with the goal of returning it to harmed investors.

Challengers say courts lack express authority from Congress to order the punishment, which is known as disgorgement. The critics also argue the SEC sometimes fails to return the money to investors, making the payments look more like a penalty that would require explicit congressional authority.

Justices on Tuesday appeared to dwell less on those questions and more on how disgorgement should be calculated and where the money should go.

"Would the government have any difficulty with a rule that the money should be returned to investors where feasible?" asked Justice Neil Gorsuch. The more liberal Justice Elena Kagan posed a similar question, as did other justices.

Arguing the case for the SEC, Deputy Solicitor General Malcolm Stewart later said he didn't object to that approach.

The SEC says it tries to return ill-gotten gains to investors whenever possible. In some cases, such as those alleging bribery of foreign officials or insider trading, there are no obvious victims to return money to, regulators say.

The SEC says courts' authority to require disgorgement comes from their power to enforce corrective measures that make victims whole again.

The dispute before the court relates to an enforcement action taken against Charles Liu and Xin Wang in 2016. The couple was accused of defrauding investors who handed them $26 million to build a cancer-treatment center. Courts ordered Mr. Liu and Ms. Wang to give back that entire sum, not just the profits they were accused of pocketing.

U.S. News -- Analysis: After Rate Cut, Pressure on Fed Persists

The three main reasons behind the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts on Tuesday help explain why the central bank is likely to lower rates again.

The Fed hoped to boost public confidence, prevent financial conditions from worsening and cushion the U.S. economy against a global growth downturn.

While the rate cut may help on each of those fronts, the outlook could grow darker in the weeks ahead as the number of U.S. coronavirus cases rises.

The rate cut Tuesday came between the Fed's regularly scheduled policy meetings, illustrating urgency to get ahead of an unfolding shock, even if the underlying nature of the threat isn't economic.

Since 1998, the Fed has cut interest rates six other times between regularly scheduled meetings. Following each of those moves, the Fed has lowered rates again at its next policy meeting.

"For us, what really matters of course is not the epidemiology, but the risk to the economy," said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday. "So we saw a risk to the outlook for the economy and chose to act."

Any good economic data released in coming weeks can be easily dismissed because they will show how the economy fared prior to the spread of the virus. And more bad news seems likely.

Confidence could falter as health authorities test more widely for the infection, revealing how far it has spread and possibly prompting school closures and remote work arrangements.

"The effects are at a very early stage," said Mr. Powell, referring to increasingly negative sentiment from travel and hospitality businesses. "We expect that will continue. It will probably grow."

The same dynamic could weigh on financial markets. Measures to contain and mitigate the damage could force companies to lower their earnings forecasts and weigh on stock and corporate-bond markets. The Fed acted Tuesday rather than wait until its March 17-18 meeting to prevent a deeper pullback in credit availability that can occur when lenders reassess borrowers' creditworthiness.

Mr. Powell said the Fed was prepared for a possible increase in corporate defaults or business failures. "We don't see any of that happening yet. Of course, we are thinking about what we can do, should those things happen," he said.

Finally, the U.S. economy faces disrupted supply chains and weaker global economic activity. This downturn could deepen if policy makers abroad aren't able or willing to spur growth. Interest rates are already low and many central banks don't have the wherewithal to reduce them much further.

Countries already experiencing low rates of growth -- such as Italy, Japan and Germany -- are very likely to sink into recession in the coming months. "We need to be mindful that the impact from the outbreak could be big," Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda said Wednesday.

Other central banks with interest rates above zero cut them this week. The Bank of Canada reduced its policy rate by half a percentage point, and the Reserve Bank of Australia reduced its policy rate by one-quarter of a percentage point to a record low of 0.5%.

The Fed's cut took its benchmark rate to a range between 1% and 1.25%, leaving it more room than most other developed-economy central banks to cut further. U.S. rate cuts also make it easier for central banks in emerging markets to lower their borrowing costs without triggering capital flight.

U.S. bond markets may be showing greater signs of hazard ahead. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to new lows on Tuesday and Wednesday. While declines in bond yields in recent weeks have reflected lower inflation expectations and investors seeking havens, most of the most recent drop reflects lower growth expectations, said Roberto Perli, an analyst at research firm Cornerstone Macro.

Over more than 6,000 trading days since 1997, growth expectations reflected in the benchmark 10-year Treasury have fallen by a larger magnitude than they did on Tuesday only 25 times, and most of those were during or before recessions hit, he said.

Lower borrowing costs aren't likely to be effective without broader confidence-building efforts by federal and local authorities to demonstrate they have put in place measures to slow the spread of the new coronavirus.

China Imprisons a Swedish Bookseller

The sentencing of bookseller Gui Minhai to 10 years in Chinese prison is another example of the Chinese Communist Party's willingness to trample on the rule of law and thumb its nose at the world. The Chinese-born Mr. Gui is a Swedish citizen, yet China has forced him to renounce his rights as a foreigner. Sweden's diplomats were barred from observing his trial and have been denied consular access.

Mr. Gui is also a Hong Kong resident, but the city's Chief Executive Carrie Lam has washed her hands of him. Three years ago she said it "would not be appropriate" for her to raise his case, or that of others from Hong Kong detained in the mainland, with the Chinese authorities.

Mr. Gui's ordeal began with his apparent kidnapping five years ago in Thailand, where he has a second home. A few months later he appeared on Chinese state television, "confessing" involvement in a fatal traffic accident that allegedly occurred more than a decade earlier.

Since then he has mostly been held incommunicado in Ningbo, China. He spent two years in prison, and then a few months in some form of house arrest. Swedish diplomats negotiated his release in 2018, and were with him on a train to Beijing when he was abducted again. Two years later, he has been sentenced, for "illegally providing intelligence" to "overseas" parties -- a far cry from a traffic accident.

Why was Mr. Gui targeted? In Hong Kong, he ran a publishing house and bookshop that sold books about China's top leaders. Some criticized Chinese politics and others were more salacious and gossipy. These books were banned in China, and so people came to buy them in Hong Kong, where they weren't illegal and still technically aren't. Mr. Gui, together with Lam Wing-kee, Lee Bo, Lu Bo and Zhang Zhiping, ran a thriving business in Causeway Bay. The booksellers disappeared, one by one, in 2015, though all except Mr. Gui were eventually released.

Three days after Mr. Gui's sentencing in Ningbo, three key pro-democracy leaders, media mogul Jimmy Lai and former legislators Lee Cheuk-yan and Yeung Sum, were arrested early in the morning by Hong Kong police on spurious charges of participating in "illegal assembly." Unlike Mr. Gui, they were released after a few hours and will appear in court in May with legal representation.

In recent years other foreigners have been detained in China in cruel and illicit ways for political reasons -- British businessman Peter Humphrey, Swedish activist Peter Dahlin, Taiwanese activist Li Ming-che, and Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. But Gui's case reveals that Beijing is prepared to reach across borders, across diplomatic norms and far beyond legal limits to silence critics.

The world's democracies need to wake up to the danger. Sweden has primary responsibility for securing Mr. Gui's release, but its leverage is limited, and the case threatens the whole international world order.

U.S. News: Rescue Teams Comb Through Tornado Rubble

Search-and-rescue teams continued to look for survivors Wednesday in hard-hit Putnam County, east of Nashville, a day after tornadoes tore across the state and left a trail of ruin.

The twisters killed at least 24 people, according to the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. Officials had said the death toll was 25 but revised it late Tuesday.

Homes and businesses were reduced to rubble in a swath of middle Tennessee, including Nashville. About 40,000 people still lacked power Wednesday, the agency said.

Eighteen of the deaths occurred in Putnam County, a scenic area about 80 miles east of Nashville known for hiking and fishing. Five of them were children under the age of 13, county Mayor Randy Porter said. As of Wednesday morning, 18 people remained missing in the county, down from about 88 on Tuesday.

"We're hoping that most of those are people that are safe that just haven't let us know that they are," Mr. Porter said. "We're going to be working through that list diligently today to try to make sure that hopefully tonight to have that number down to zero."

On Wednesday, the county was deploying six-person search-and rescue teams to continue to comb through the rubble of buildings and open expanses littered with debris, said Putnam County Sheriff Eddie Farris at a news briefing. He said the teams still had about 40% of the rubble to go through, in a county where roughly 100 homes were destroyed or severely damaged. They will search the remains of houses, basements and crawl spaces.

"We still could have some people trapped," Mr. Porter said.

Another area the teams planned to tackle is a roughly two-dozen-acre marshy field with dense vegetation that lay in the path of the storm, Sheriff Farris said. The task is especially urgent because of the possibility of more inclement weather coming in the next day.

The work of accounting for the missing proved difficult Tuesday because of poor cell service, with cell towers down and the network flooded by people trying to reach one another, Mr. Porter said.

U.S. News: Schumer Is Rebuked by Chief Justice

WASHINGTON -- Chief Justice John Roberts on Wednesday criticized the Senate's top Democrat for saying the Supreme Court's two Trump appointees will "pay the price" should they vote against abortion rights.

"I want to tell you, Gorsuch. I want to tell you, Kavanaugh. You have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price!" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said, speaking of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh at a rally outside the courthouse while the justices heard arguments over a Louisiana abortion law. "You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions."

Chief Justice Roberts, who in 2018 spoke out against President Trump's attacks on federal judges, cited Mr. Schumer's remarks in a statement issued after Wednesday's hearing concluded.

"Justices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous. All Members of the Court will continue to do their job, without fear or favor, from whatever quarter," the statement said.

Mr. Schumer's spokesman responded: "Sen. Schumer's comments were a reference to the political price Senate Republicans will pay for putting these justices on the court, and a warning that the justices will unleash a major grass roots movement on the issue of reproductive rights against the decision."

Supreme Court justices have been in the political cross hairs recently.

During a visit to India last month, the president said Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg should be recused from cases involving him though he didn't threaten the justices. Chief Justice Roberts didn't address the president's remarks.

Mr. Trump, on Twitter Wednesday night, called Mr. Schumer's comments "a direct & dangerous threat to the U.S. Supreme Court."

"If a Republican did this, he or she would be arrested, or impeached," Mr. Trump wrote. "Serious action MUST be taken NOW!"

In November 2018, the chief justice rebutted comments from Mr. Trump disparaging federal courts in California.

Banking & Finance: Fed Alters Capital Rules for Big Banks

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve retooled capital rules for the largest U.S. banks, completing one of the biggest changes to the postcrisis rulebook for Wall Street during the Trump administration.

Fed officials on Wednesday said the changes would simplify rules for big banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. without posing risks to the stability of the financial system.

The overhaul "simplifies the post-crisis capital framework for banks, while maintaining the strong capital requirements that are the hallmark of the framework," Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles said.

The overhaul reflects the latest moves by the Fed to recalibrate oversight of big U.S. lenders. Already, officials have completed separate changes aimed at easing liquidity and capital rules for regional U.S. banks and retooled speculative trading limits for large firms.

Fed governor Lael Brainard, an Obama-era appointee, cast the sole dissenting vote against the plan, saying she believed it would reduce banks' required capital levels and the amount they set aside as a buffer above their regulatory requirements.

She said the plan "gives a green light for large banks to reduce their capital buffers materially, at a time when payouts have already exceeded earnings for several years on average."

But Mr. Quarles said the changes would maintain the overall level of capital in the system and modestly increase required capital levels for the largest firms.

His estimates were based on stress-test data from 2013 to 2019, he said.

World News: Epidemic Strains China's Labor Market --- Business slowdowns threaten an already weakened workforce; quit or take less pay

Corrections & Amplifications

In a survey of more than 8,000 working professionals by Chinese recruitment website Zhaopin in mid-February, nearly one-third of respondents said they had observed companies cutting jobs, and 46% said they knew of firms that hadn't paid salaries on time. A World News article Thursday about China's labor market and an accompanying chart incorrectly said that the survey was of more than 8,000 companies and that the responses represented the companies' plans rather than respondents' observations. Also, 19% of respondents said they had observed business failures. The chart incorrectly said 19% of businesses had filed for bankruptcy.

(WSJ March 7, 2020)

(END)

A sharp economic slowdown in China caused by the coronavirus epidemic is putting new pressure on the country's labor market, as businesses struggling to maintain or revive operations resort to pay cuts and layoffs -- or simply shut down.

More job cuts could further depress consumer spending and weaken an economy that is projected to slow significantly or contract in the first quarter.

Jim Huang, chief executive of China-America Commodity Data Analytics, a consulting firm, said he had no choice but to lay off 18 of his 20 employees in Wuhan after it became impossible to run his business in the hard-hit city because of a government quarantine there.

Many of his employees were in other parts of China when the lockdown started and couldn't return, he said, making it difficult to serve clients and keep cash coming in. Mr. Huang, a U.S. citizen, said he is thinking of giving up as he waits out the epidemic in the U.S., where he is buying a farm.

"I believe we have already entered into a recession" in China, he said. "If things get better, cool. If not, I'll start a new chapter of my life here."

Other Chinese companies face similar problems. Uxin Ltd., an online used-car dealer with more than 12,000 employees, began furloughing staff at the beginning of March and paying reduced salaries meant to cover minimum living costs, citing "difficulty in operations," according to a letter sent to some employees.

The company on Monday said it had taken a "series of measures to quickly adapt business for long-term growth," including, with employees' support, "enacting a temporary workload-based staffing program" to cut costs. A spokeswoman declined to comment further.

Although companies are pushing to restart factories and ramp up business as fast as possible, quarantines and other government restrictions have made it hard to do so. As of late February, only 30% of China's small and midsize companies had returned to normal operations, according to a survey by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.

A survey of more than 8,000 firms by Chinese recruitment website Zhaopin in mid-February showed that nearly one-thirdplanned to cut jobs, while 46% said they might not be able to pay salaries on time.

Many companies remained hopeful that hiring would snap back sharply once the outbreak is contained.

Disruptions in China's labor productivity and supply chain are expected to scale back foreign investment sharply during the first half of the year, but are unlikely to deter investors' longer-term interest, some analysts say.

Chinese officials have many tools to help stabilize the job market, including ordering local governments to offer unemployment subsidies and extending credit to stressed companies.

"Every effort must be made to prevent massive layoffs, and local governments must help keep employment stable," Premier Li Keqiang said in February.

China's urban unemployment rate crept up to 5.2% in December from 4.8% at the beginning of last year. Many economists and scholars have long warned that official unemployment figures are likely to be understated; Chinese officials stand by their numbers.

Even if the epidemic is controlled by the end of March, it could wipe out as many as five million jobs, said Dan Wang, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.

Miniso, a fast-growing retailer backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd. and private-equity firm Hillhouse Capital Management Inc., told staff in a letter Feb. 21 that while it didn't intend to lay off workers as a humanitarian principle, it planned to slash the next paycheck -- covering January's wages -- by 20% and by at least 30% for February and March.

A former Miniso employee in Guangzhou said his manager told him he could quit and be paid in full for the first two months of the year or stay on staff and accept a forced salary cut and suspension in March.

The 27-year-old former employee said he was under great financial pressure, with an auto loan, 2,000 yuan ($287) in monthly rent, and as much as 3,000 yuan in monthly consumer loans. "My savings can only sustain for another two months. But looking for a new job hasn't been easy. No companies are open for interviews at the moment."

A Miniso spokesman said the company revised its initial proposal and paid January salaries in full after receiving feedback from employees. The company had no intention to lay off staff but would "make proper adjustments" to salaries for February and March depending on workloads, he added.

OTTAWA -- The Bank of Canada on Wednesday took a cue from the Federal Reserve and cut its benchmark interest rate by a half percentage point in response to mounting worries about the economic toll of the coronavirus epidemic.

It also signaled a willingness to ease further to guard against a deteriorating outlook.

The central bank said the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected more than 10,000 people outside China, represents a material negative shock to the Canadian and global economic outlooks. Its announcement came one day after the Fed's emergency rate cut, also by a half percentage point.

Wednesday's half-percentage-point cut brings the central bank's overnight rate to 1.25%, down from 1.75%.

The Case For Ginsburg To Recuse Herself

President Trump recently lashed out at Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. "Both should recuse themselves on all Trump, or Trump related, matters!" he tweeted. He's wrong about Justice Sotomayor but has a point about Justice Ginsburg.

In a lone opinion dissenting from the court's order in Wolf v. Cook County, Justice Sotomayor said she wouldn't stay a lower court's injunction against a Trump immigration policy. "Claiming one emergency after another," she wrote, "the Government has recently sought stays in an unprecedented number of cases, demanding immediate attention and consuming limited Court resources in each." (Three other justices dissented without issuing opinions.)

Justice Sotomayor's opinion doesn't disparage Mr. Trump. She criticizes the government's position, but she's harsher on her colleagues in the majority, writing that their "recent behavior on stay applications has benefited one litigant over all others." Mr. Trump is the one personalizing a legal dispute, and it would pervert justice if litigants could force judges to remove themselves from cases simply by denouncing them publicly.

Justice Ginsburg is a different case. In public interviews in 2016 she called Candidate Trump a "faker" and said: "I can't imagine what this place would be -- I can't imagine what the country would be -- with Donald Trump as our president." She even mused about fleeing the country: "'Now it's time for us to move to New Zealand." She apologized -- kind of: "Judges should avoid commenting on a candidate for public office." She admitted her remarks were "ill advised," and that "in the future I will be more circumspect."

The controversy died down, in part because hardly anyone expected Mr. Trump to become president. Now that he's raised the matter again, is he right? The answer seems to be yes. Litigants -- including Mr. Trump -- have a right to appear before judges who have not prejudged the case or the person.

In Cheney v. U.S. District Court (2004), Justice Antonin Scalia rejected a petition to recuse himself from a case involving the vice president, with whom he had gone on a hunting trip. "While friendship is a ground for recusal of a Justice where the personal fortune or the personal freedom of the friend is at issue, it has traditionally not been a ground for recusal where official action is at issue," Scalia wrote.

But Justice Ginsburg's antagonism toward Mr. Trump wasn't personal. In effect she campaigned against him on the grounds that he was unfit for office. The Code of Conduct for Federal Judges directs that no judge should "publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office."

The code doesn't apply to Supreme Court justices, but they are expected to police their own ethics. In this untraditional era, Mr. Trump has ignored decades of ethical norms. But is it a good idea for Justice Ginsburg to follow his lead?

U.S. News: High Court Tussles Over Abortion Law

WASHINGTON -- Supreme Court justices voiced clashing views in a case that will test whether a more conservative high court will move to narrow access to abortions.

During an hourlong oral argument Wednesday, the court considered a 2014 Louisiana law that requires doctors performing abortions to hold admitting privileges at a hospital no more than 30 miles away.

The Supreme Court, by a 5-3 vote, struck down a similar Texas law in 2016, making Wednesday's case partly a question of whether the justices will reaffirm that precedent -- or begin to relax legal doctrines holding "undue burdens" on abortion rights unconstitutional.

Challengers in the case, a Shreveport, La., abortion clinic and two physicians who provide abortions, argued that admitting privileges provide no health or safety benefits. Instead, the rules are aimed at curbing abortion and impose an undue burden on women by leaving the state with just a single clinic, lawyer Julie Rikelman of the Center for Reproductive Rights told the court.

Louisiana's lawyer, state Solicitor General Elizabeth Murrill, said the requirements were intended to protect the health and safety of patients, to vet doctors and to bring abortion regulations in line with those for other outpatient procedures.

No issue before the court is more heated than abortion, and none carries greater political implications, with the next president expected to have one or more vacancies to fill. The Trump administration sent a Justice Department lawyer to argue on behalf of the Louisiana law. As a candidate, President Trump, who has named two justices to the court, predicted his appointees surely would vote to overrule Roe v. Wade, the 1973 opinion establishing abortion rights.

At Wednesday's hearing, justices' questions ran the gamut, from broad ruminations on the significance of precedent to scrutiny of how diligent specific doctors in Louisiana -- each identified by court order as John Doe, to protect them from potential harassment from abortion foes -- were in seeking admitting privileges.

Justice Samuel Alito asked early on why abortion providers even had standing to bring legal claims based on alleged burdens faced by patients -- those the state is trying to protect from abortion providers.

Ms. Rikelman responded that the providers, as those being directly regulated by the state, had proper legal standing

"Well, that's amazing," Justice Alito said. Throughout the argument, he returned to the theme that abortion clinics potentially held a conflict of interest with women seeking abortions.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg pointed out cases where the court allowed third parties to assert constitutional rights on behalf of their clients. In 1976, for instance, the court struck down an Oklahoma law prohibiting sales of low-alcohol beer to men under 21, but allowing its sale to women over 18.

She and other liberal justices said the admitting-privileges requirement made no sense, since they may be granted or denied for reasons unrelated to physician competence. Complications from abortion are rare, she said; when one requiring hospitalization does arise, it typically is after the patient has returned home and would likely go to the closest hospital.

"I'm prepared to concede that it may not happen all that often," said Jeffrey Wall, the U.S. deputy solicitor general who argued in support of Louisiana.

Justice Neil Gorsuch was uncharacteristically silent during the argument.

There were signs that some justices might be seeking a middle ground that could put a reckoning over abortion rights off to another day.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggested the 30-mile limit, rather than admitting privileges by themselves, could be such a place.

"Would this be different if they did something as limited as, for example, 'You have to be admitted somewhere, because being admitted somewhere does further the credentialing benefits" the state says hospital privileges provide, she asked.

"The medical consensus is clear that in no state do they serve health and safety benefits," Ms. Rikelman said.

"It's not just credentialing. It is all of the other factors that also play into it," said Louisiana's lawyer, Ms. Murrill. "It does provide continuity of care. It does address the noncompliance with health and safety regulations" that she said have characterized some abortion providers.

A decision in Wednesday's case, June Medical Services LLC v. Russo, is expected before July.

World News: ECB Looks At Options To Bolster Economy

FRANKFURT -- The Federal Reserve's surprise rate cut this week puts the European Central Bank under pressure to act as the eurozone's already lethargic economy creaks under the spreading coronavirus epidemic.

There is just one problem: The bank's past efforts to stimulate growth means it doesn't have enough ammunition left to match the U.S. measures. This comes on top of existing doubts about whether monetary policy is the right tool to tackle the fallout from the epidemic.

The outbreak is the first major test for Christine Lagarde, the recently appointed ECB president. An attorney, former French finance minister and former managing director of the International Monetary Fund, she has no prior central banking experience.

While central banks in Australia, Canada, China, Japan and the U.S. have already moved aggressively to support their economies, the ECB has so far held back, even though the bloc's economy has been weak for a year. On Wednesday, a day after the Fed cut rates by 0.5 percentage point, eurozone finance ministers were discussing the region's response to the crisis on a call that was joined by Ms. Lagarde.

The ECB has fewer obvious tools to combat any slowdown than the Fed. The ECB already cut its key interest rate to minus 0.5% last September to support the economy, and restarted a controversial program to purchase 20 billion euros ($22.3 billion) a month of eurozone government and corporate debt.

But the bank still has a broad toolbox compared with many of its peers. It could push negative interest rates further below zero -- although that could put pressure on the region's banks -- and it is considering rolling out targeted loans for banks and businesses hit by the virus.

The ECB, which is likely to announce its next policy steps at a news conference on March 12, could also step up the pace of its 2.6 trillion euro bond-buying program, which could help ease pressure on the region's governments and companies, and support any fiscal stimulus.

ECB officials would prefer eurozone governments to bear more of the burden of supporting the region's economy. Germany and Italy have both announced small fiscal measures in recent days, such as subsidies and tax breaks for companies. But many eurozone governments already have high debt levels, Germany is philosophically opposed to deficit-financed spending, and -- despite years of negotiations -- there is still no central eurozone budget.

Following the conference call Wednesday, eurozone finance ministers said they are willing to step up spending to support growth. "We are prepared to take further policy action," said Mario Centeno, who heads the Eurogroup of finance ministers. "This includes fiscal measures, where appropriate."

World News: U.S.-Taliban Deal Faces New Hurdles --- Afghan leader refuses to meet Trump's envoy, as American military conducts new strikes

BEIRUT -- The Trump administration is facing an uphill battle to keep a landmark agreement with the Taliban on track after a resurgence of violence and growing diplomatic strain between Washington and Kabul.

President Ashraf Ghani declined on Wednesday to meet with President Trump's special envoy, who arrived in Kabul in an effort to salvage a four-day old agreement calling for the U.S. military to withdraw from Afghanistan by next fall, an Afghan government official said. The U.S. envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, is expected to instead meet Mr. Ghani's vice president, Amrullah Saleh.

Mr. Ghani's difficulties with the U.S. have been increasing in recent months. The U.S. hasn't recognized his re-election following a disputed presidential contest against Mr. Ghani's rival, Abdullah Abdullah, last year. And Mr. Ghani has refused to cooperate with the Trump administration on its pledge to the Taliban to secure release of up to 5,000 insurgents held by the Afghan government.

Under the deal, the prisoner release must precede any talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government. Those talks are set to start Tuesday, but a delay is likely.

On Wednesday the U.S. military conducted an airstrike against the Taliban in defense of Afghan forces, the first since the U.S. signed a deal with the militant group to map out an end to 18 years of war, America's longest.

The Taliban fighters were targeting an Afghan security checkpoint in southern Afghanistan, U.S. officials said.

Hours before the U.S. airstrike, Mr. Trump said he had a "good talk" with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban co-founder who signed the deal in Doha, Qatar.

The agreement doesn't explicitly call for an immediate reduction in violence. However, the U.S. military accused the Taliban of "squandering" its chance to end the war by stepping up its attacks against Afghan security forces after the deal was signed in Qatar. The Taliban previously had agreed to a seven-day reduction in violence as a show of good faith before the deal was signed.

The Taliban spokesman in Doha said the group was committed to implementing the deal and moving toward a reduction in violence.

"The other side must also remove the barriers to the implementation of all parts of the Agreement," Suhail Shaheen said on Twitter.

U.S. officials had hoped the Taliban would agree to informally extend the seven-day truce, but the Taliban declared its plans to resume attacks on Afghan security forces. The deal stipulates only that the Taliban must include a cease-fire as an agenda item when Afghan talks begin.

Since the signing of the deal Saturday, Taliban forces have carried out at least 76 attacks in nearly three quarters of the country's provinces, according to the country's National Security Council.

U.S. News: Appeals Court Narrows Asylum Policy Ruling

A federal appeals court for now agreed to narrow the effect of its recent ruling that blocked a Trump administration policy of returning immigrants at the southern U.S. border to Mexico while their requests for asylum are considered.

The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, in an order issued Wednesday, said it ruled correctly last week that the administration's "Remain in Mexico" policy is unlawful.

But the court acknowledged the "intense and active controversy" over nationwide injunctions against administration policies and said it would limit its ruling for now to the two border states within its jurisdiction: Arizona and California.

That means the Trump administration could continue enforcing the policy in the border states of New Mexico and Texas for months while it mounts a Supreme Court appeal.

The Ninth Circuit also said none of its ruling would go into effect until March 12, giving the Trump administration a week to ask the Supreme Court for an emergency stay to keep the policy in place everywhere for the time being.

The "remain in Mexico" policy, formally called the Migrant Protection Protocols, made its debut in January 2019 as the Trump administration sought alternatives to releasing families seeking asylum into the U.S., where they were permitted to live for months, and often years, as their cases made their way through backlogged immigration courts.

The government has sent more than 60,000 migrants seeking asylum back across the border in the past year, where they were required to wait in violent Mexican border cities for months for U.S. court dates.

Many migrants who have been returned to Mexico -- about half, according to recent data -- simply drop their claims before they are decided.

With the Ninth Circuit saying it will begin blocking the Trump policy in Arizona and California, the court order could inadvertently create a new magnet for migrants to cross the border there, rather than in South Texas, which is a shorter trip from Central America.

Immigration officials launched the policy in Arizona last year after word spread that migrants arrested crossing the border near Nogales, Ariz., weren't being sent back to Mexico.

Fearful Investors Pile Into Germany's Bunds

As the economic fallout from the coronavirus spreads across Europe, the safest haven available to investors is in chronically short supply.

German government bonds, known as bunds, are the benchmark safe asset in the eurozone, playing a similar role to Treasurys in the U.S. They are what investors compare all other returns against and the thing everyone wants to own when markets are in turmoil.

Because Germany issues very little debt, and because a chunk of the bond supply is locked up by European Central Bank buying, when investors clamor for bunds, yields fall quickly.

The 10-year bund traded as low as minus 0.69% on Thursday, down from minus 0.39% on Feb. 18 when the coronavirus selloff intensified in Europe, according to Tradeweb. The downward trajectory in bund yields has been faster than other European government bonds, sliding more in percentage-point terms than both the French and Dutch equivalents.

"When there is a proper dislocation in the market, German bunds continue to be the safe haven in Europe. Even with negative yields, we still see the flight to quality,"" said Iain Stealey, international chief investment officer for fixed income at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.

Driving the yields lower are strong signals from the ECB that it will follow the Federal Reserve's surprise rate cuts with action of its own next week. It is scheduled to meet on Thursday. ECB President Christine Lagarde said Monday that the bank is ready to take "appropriate and targeted measures"" in response to the epidemic and its impact on the economy.

That could include lowering the already negative rate the ECB charges banks on deposits or increasing the size of its bond-purchase program.

"We're expecting something more targeted, which could mean expansion" of quantitative easing, said Cathal Kennedy, European economist at RBC Capital Markets. That would likely mean the ECB buying more government and corporate debt.

Germany's penchant for frugality means it runs a budget surplus and issues very little debt. Berlin had a total of 1.58 trillion euros ($1.76 trillion) of outstanding debt securities in January. That is compared with more than $16 trillion from the U.S. and $10 trillion in Japan.

The plunge in bund yields seems to reflect skepticism that Germany will change its tune and increase that supply of debt despite yields on its debt of all maturities typically being in negative territory.

"How bad does the European economy have to get before Germany wants to do that, that's the big question," Mr. Stealey said. "That's really what we'll be focusing on."

Also keeping supply tight: The ECB currently owns 30% of German government debt, which includes sovereign, regional and municipal bonds, according to Societe Generale.

MANSION --- The Market: The Rapid Growth Of the Mega-Rich --- The number of people worth $30 million or more is way up

New York City condo developers are facing a supply overhang and tax changes resulting in greater costs for buyers. But there is one bright spot: an uptick in the number of people around the world who can afford their seven-digit apartments.

Approximately 31,000 ultra-high-net-worth people were minted in 2019, an annual growth rate of 6% and more than three people per hour, according to a new report by U.K.-based real-estate firm Knight Frank and New York brokerage Douglas Elliman. The report defined ultra-high-net-worth individuals as people with a net worth of $30 million or more. The previous year saw a rate of just 4%.

North America created the most of this cohort, adding 13,911 in 2019, compared with 4,682 in Europe. Asia also saw its population increase dramatically over the past year, adding 11,788 such individuals, according to the report.

The trend is set to continue. The number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals around the world is forecast to grow by about 27% in the next five years, according to the report. That means there will be about 650,000 people around the world with at least $30 million by 2024.

Countries with the fastest-growing population of these individuals include India, which is slated to see a 73% increase by 2024, as well as Egypt, Vietnam and China.

Luxury New York real-estate agent Leonard Steinberg of Compass said these are the kind of numbers that drive real-estate marketers in cities like New York.

"The billionaire class is a small group of people and they're exceedingly over exposed," he said. "The lesser known rich don't get nearly as much press. Real-estate marketers are paying close attention to where they are," he said.

A search of website StreetEasy shows that there are about 155 listings in Manhattan priced at $10 million or more, though those numbers don't include all new development inventory.

The report also points to a shift in how ultra-high-net-worth individuals are spending their money, said Liam Bailey, global head of research at Knight Frank. Amid concerns of a global economic slowdown, they are shifting investing strategies in 2020, eschewing equities for private-equity investments, cash, gold and real estate.

Roughly 43% of the respondents in the survey of 620 wealth advisers, who manage about $3.3 trillion on behalf of these individuals, said they would increase their real-estate exposure in 2020, the data shows. Meanwhile, roughly 38% said they planned to cut their allocations in equities.

Predictions about small groups aren't an exact science. Knight Frank also has an economic interest in selling high-end homes.

For buyers in Asia particularly, the U.S. is still the top destination for residential real estate outside their home countries, according to an attitudes survey cited in the report.

"The appeal of holding a dollar-denominated asset in the world's biggest economy is likely to increase on the back of 2019's three rate cuts, with some buyers viewing the lull in the run up to the presidential election as a potential opportunity," the report said.

However, it was cities in Europe and Asia that topped Knight Frank's pricing index in 2019. Germany's Frankfurt topped the list of fastest-growing cities in terms of real-estate prices, posting a 10.3% gain in 2019, thanks in part to rock-bottom interest rates.

In Asia, the city of Taipei posted a gain of 8.9%.

Vancouver was the weakest performer, with a decline of 8.3%. Once a popular market with Chinese buyers, the market has been affected by a torrent of regulations since 2016, including a 20% foreign-buyer tax.

New York also instituted a mansion tax, which charges buyers a larger one-time tax payment at the time of closing. It increases incrementally with purchase prices of $2 million or more, topping out at 3.9% for properties sold for $25 million or more.

Business News: Outbreak Crisis Bankrupts Airline --- British regional carrier Flybe grounds flights, enters protection as bookings plunge

The coronavirus outbreak claimed U.K. regional airline carrier Flybe, which entered bankruptcy administration and forced the cancellation of dozens of flights across the country.

The carrier, owned by a consortium including Britain's Virgin Atlantic, has struggled financially for months -- long before the widespread emergence of the virus outbreak. Its shareholders infused cash into it as recently as January, and the British government agreed to extend the payment of air-passenger taxes to help lessen strain.

But a bigger, hoped-for government rescue package didn't materialize, and a recent virus-related plunge in bookings forced Flybe's owners to balk at putting any more money in. A spokesman for Virgin said, "the impact of Covid-19 on Flybe's trading means that the consortium can no longer commit to continued financial support."

All flights by Flybe -- which flies mostly regional routes across the U.K., including to many of its less well-served regions -- and sister carrier Stobart Air were grounded early Thursday, stranding passengers.

Virgin, which is 49% owned by Delta Air Lines Inc., said it was looking at options to support the airline's roughly 2,400 staff. Last year, Flybe accounted for about 38% of U.K. domestic flights, according to the European Regions Airline Association. It had operated 139 routes, serving eight countries from 56 airports. It is a big player in some of Britain's second-tier cities, like Manchester and Birmingham, in England, and Aberdeen, Scotland.

Airlines around the world have been hammered by the virus outbreak. Travelers are canceling flights and not booking new ones. Several large companies, including Nestle SA, are forbidding staff to embark on business travel, one of the biggest profit drivers for the industry.

The International Air Transport Association forecast Thursday that the virus could reduce passenger revenue world-wide by between $63 billion and $113 billion this year -- a dramatic step up from the trade group's last estimate, in February, of just under $30 billion.

Until recently, most of the industry carnage was contained in China, the epicenter of the virus outbreak. Airlines have grounded planes and taken draconian cost-cutting measures. Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., Hong Kong's flag carrier, has required all staff to take three weeks' unpaid leave.

The pain has now spilled over into Europe and is washing up on U.S. shores, too. Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Germany's flagship, announced a total of 7,100 European flight cancellations for the month of March. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, the budget trans-Atlantic carrier, said Thursday it was canceling 22 flights between Europe and the U.S.

Flight bookings to Europe fell 79% compared with the same period a year earlier, according to ForwardKeys, which tracks travel data.

"We've taken a big hit," said Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Dublin-based budget carrier, speaking at an industry conference in Brussels this week. "What I foresee is very deflated bookings for the next 2-3 weeks." Beyond that, he said, bookings will depend on how the virus spreads.

Punctuating the geographic spread of the industry pressure, United Airlines Holdings Inc., which has already slashed international flights, said late Wednesday it would cut domestic flights, too.

HNA Group Co., the owner of Chinese carrier Hainan Airlines, is another victim of the epidemic, though so far has managed to keep its airline flying. The group asked for a government takeover.

U.S. News: Tech Giants Vow Help Against Child Exploitation

Representatives from law enforcement and the technology industry pledged to step up their fight against child sexual abuse on the internet, but they remained at odds over government concerns about misuses of the encryption technology deployed by some companies.

Attorney General William Barr on Thursday said six major technology companies had agreed to a set of voluntary principles that would guide their approach to fighting online sexual exploitation of children.

The technology companies have agreed to a series of high-level principles that will govern the way they police online content -- ideas such as focusing their efforts on areas that have been difficult to monitor, such as live streaming, and taking into account solutions proposed by victims. Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Microsoft Corp., Snap Inc. and Twitter Inc., as well as the online gaming hub Roblox Corp., have been developing these principles since July, the Justice Department said.

But Mr. Barr and some of the U.S.'s closest international intelligence-sharing partners -- a group known as the Five Eyes -- remain concerned that encryption technology, particularly Facebook's plans to add end-to-end messaging encryption, could leave them in the dark. Some members of that group last year voiced their concerns about the spreading private-sector use of such technology.

"Encryption remains the elephant in the room," James Brokenshire, a minister with the U.K.'s Home Office, said Thursday in Washington. "Last year, Facebook identified around 12 million incidents of child sexual exploitation abuse on Messenger -- something that I absolutely commend them for doing -- yet plans to encrypt this service would leave you blind to the same crimes."

Facebook, meanwhile, reiterated its concern that any government efforts to roll back encryption would undermine the security of its products."We believe companies and governments can work together to keep children safe online while still protecting people's privacy and continuing to secure their messages with encryption," a company spokesman said via email.

Mr. Barr also rebuked Apple Inc. less than two months ago for its encryption and other digital-security measures when he escalated pressure on the company to open a pair of iPhones belonging to an aviation student from Saudi Arabia who killed three people at a Florida Navy base late last year.

Mr. Barr has shown a willingness to confront tech companies in a way that has concerned even some like-minded Federal Bureau of Investigation officials who fear it could hurt the relationships they have built with Silicon Valley.

Yet Mr. Barr, speaking at the media event Thursday where officials declined to answer questions, appeared to soften his tone. He again lamented suspects' ability to communicate through "virtually unbreakable encryption," saying "predators' supposed privacy interests should not outweigh our children's privacy and security; there's too much at stake." But, he added that he was heartened that companies had signed onto the principles.

Four years ago, the Justice Department launched a legal fight against Apple, looking to compel the iPhone maker into granting it access to the mobile phone used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif., terror suspects. Government officials ultimately backed down after a private firm found a way to access the phone.

Apple wasn't named in Thursday's announcement, but a company spokesman said it endorses the principles.

In addition to Mr. Barr's statements,Sens. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) and Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) have proposed legislation that could pressure tech companies into providing law-enforcement access to these systems.

Apple, like Facebook, has said any system that would grant such access would undermine the security of their products and create opportunities for criminals and authoritarian governments to improperly access user data.

Schumer and the War on Judges

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's verbal threats against two Supreme Court justices aren't surprising, in light of three years of "resistance" hostility to Trump judicial picks. What is remarkable is that Democratic leaders continue to take such a losing approach to an issue that will be central to the 2020 election.

Mr. Schumer did hit a new low Wednesday, when he stood outside the Supreme Court and rallied a mob of abortion-rights activists by vowing that Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch would "pay the price" for releasing "the whirlwind." "You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions," he thundered. When even liberal legal scholar Larry Tribe called the remarks "inexcusable," Mr. Schumer made a halfhearted attempt to walk them back, saying he "shouldn't have used the words."

Yet the Schumer threats are of a piece with today's standard Democratic approach to the court: Attack and intimidate. Of everything Democrats lost to Donald Trump in 2016, the forfeiture of the judicial branch still grates the most. They remain furious that Obama nominee Merrick Garland never got his Supreme Court robe. They are livid that the Kavanaugh confirmation provided the high court its first solid conservative majority in decades. They are outraged that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has confirmed nearly 200 Trump judges, including 51 on the appellate courts.

Unable to stop the appointments, Democrats have shifted to threatening the appointees. These have included attacks on individual judges. The hit job in 2018 on Judge Kavanaugh was about defeating his nomination, or at least cowing him into more liberal rulings. Since his confirmation, Democrats have continued to hold the threat of impeachment over his head, again in the hope of intimidating him into taking their side on key cases.

Or take Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's sucker punch of Chief Justice John Roberts during the Trump impeachment trial, in which she forced him to read aloud her question challenging his "legitimacy." Even Justice Sonia Sotomayor got in on the action, with a recent opinion that outrageously suggested her fellow conservative justices were biased in favor of Mr. Trump.

Then there are the ceaseless threats to the institution. Rhode Island's Sheldon Whitehouse and four other senators last year filed a friend-of-the-court brief warning of political consequences if the justices didn't side with them against gun rights. "The Supreme Court is not well," the brief asserted. "Perhaps the court can heal itself before the public demands it be 'restructured in order to reduce the influence of politics.'"

Liberal proposals to remake the judicial branch are a dime a hundred. Some propose packing the Supreme Court by increasing its size and creating new vacancies for a Democratic president and Senate to fill. Others demand term limits, though that would require a constitutional amendment. Yet others propose stripping or curtailing the judicial branch's authority to review entire swaths of legislation.

Mr. McConnell, in a Thursday floor speech rebuking Mr. Schumer, likened the left's message to a gangster's intimidation: "That's some nice judicial independence you got over there. It'd be a shame if something happened to it."

The attacks and threats thrill the progressive base, but they are about as politically wise as impeachment. The most important step Mr. Trump took on his path to the presidency was releasing his list of proposed replacements for the late Justice Antonin Scalia. That inventory of impressive jurists not only reassured conservatives but motivated them to vote.

Mr. Trump will make sure his court successes are at the center of his re-election campaign. He will again highlight the stakes, especially for the Supreme Court. And here are Democrats making his case more powerful by promising not only to put an end to Trump picks, but to undo his court victories to date. Talk about a Republican turnout motivator.

Democratic court radicalism also has the potential to turn off centrist voters. This week saw Super Tuesday voters offer a stark rebuke to Bernie Sanders's burn-it-down politics. (Mr. Sanders's proposal is to transfer the high court's conservatives to a different court and replace them with his own picks.) A 2019 Rasmussen poll found only 27% of Americans open to court packing. Even as American faith plummets in most government institutions, the public retains broad support for the Supreme Court. They don't appreciate the attacks.

Instead of trashing the court, maybe Democrats could make their own lists of Supreme Court picks. They'll need to do something, because the court issue is coming at them like a freight train. And all they've got is venom.

Boeing, Families Forge Tense Ties In Year After Crash --- Victims' kin in Ethiopia want a memorial, so they must work with plane maker, airline

GARA BUKAN, Ethiopia -- In the remote fields where an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX crashed a year ago, the ground is still littered with shards of metal, bolts and colorful bunches of wires that once kept Flight 302 aloft. A solitary hiking boot protrudes from the ground.

"It's a graveyard," said Nadia Milleron, whose daughter Samya Rose Stumo died there on March 10. Ms. Milleron received her daughter's remains in 122 formaldehyde-soaked bundles with labels like "arm," or "hair." Some relatives didn't even get that much.

The grieving families of the 157 dead want to mark that ground with a permanent memorial and a paved road to reach it. They envision a hospital or school to benefit local people who helped collect pieces of the wreckage and remains. Many will travel on Boeing Co.'s dime to Addis Ababa to commemorate the first anniversary of the crash next week.

The result is that families are caught in a grim partnership with the two companies that have been the source of their pain.

Nobody involved has a playbook to follow. The families, spread over some three dozen countries, are still reeling from their losses. Ethiopian Airlines has never had to deal with a tragedy of this magnitude, and Boeing has little experience working directly with families of crash victims.

Boeing has been slow to acknowledge the role its design and engineering mistakes played in the Ethiopian disaster and the similar accident off the coast of Indonesia less than five months earlier. Families have filed more than a hundred lawsuits accusing Boeing of disregarding human lives and of putting profits over safety when it developed the MAX and when it opted not to ground the plane after the first crash.

In court filings, Boeing has denied the allegations. "Safety is at the core of everything we do at Boeing," a spokesperson said. "We do not trade safety for lower cost, because without safety and quality, we don't have a business."

The company has engaged victim-compensation attorney Kenneth Feinberg to disburse $50 million in direct payments to families of the 346 people who died in the two crashes, and to oversee the distribution of another $50 million to assist communities affected by the crashes. The memorial discussions are taking place apart from this.

To make any of their hopes for a crash site a reality, the families need Boeing's money and the airline's cooperation. Accepting either means having their lives inextricably bound to these companies for possibly years to come.

"It's not easy to sit with them at a table and just start talking like nothing has happened," said Samira Eissa, whose 49-year-old father died in the crash. Ms. Eissa, 22, has been juggling planning meetings for the anniversary with her studies in Germany. "But as I see it, those are the people who put harm to us . . . so those are the ones who should be paying for that damage."

A planning session to commemorate the anniversary of the crash took place in late January in Ethiopian Airlines' Addis Ababa headquarters. The conference room looked out onto the airport where the doomed flight originated.

As the date drew near, Emmy Auma Odero was afraid of what she might do when she came face-to-face with representatives from Boeing and the airline. Her sister Immaculate Achieng Odero was 29 when she died in the crash, leaving behind a 3-year-old daughter.

"I talked to my mom. I told her pray for me, because I don't know how I'm going to face these people -- look them in the eye, sit across from them," she said. "I was very, very angry. And I'm still angry."

Nine volunteers who lost siblings, parents and others spent hours with executives from Boeing's government arm and a handful of Ethiopian Airlines officials.

Some relatives were upset about Ethiopian's proposal to hold an international design competition for a physical monument at the site of the crash, including prize money and a panel of professional judges. The families said the process Ethiopian had outlined seemed rushed -- as if the carrier was trying to put the incident behind it. They wanted to have more to say about the memorial's design, and argued they weren't being given enough time to weigh in.

At the meeting, Boeing's Tim Keating, executive vice president of government operations, stepped in, according to people in attendance, telling the Ethiopian executives that their plans were moving too quickly for many of the families.

Ethiopian Airlines executives acknowledged that communications between the airline and the families of the victims were shaky at first. "Ours is a balancing act. I think maybe at the beginning we should have seen that there were going to be challenges," said Kagnew Fisseha, vice president of holidays and digital sales for the airline, who is acting as a spokesman for Ethiopian. The memorial plans were paused.

Even logistical meetings have turned emotional, said Allan Jaboma, a Kenyan who lost his sister, who had been on her way home from a pediatric oncology conference. Nearly everyone cried at the first conference call of the committee working on the memorial, he said.

"It's nagging and we can't move on. Because we have to see all this through," Mr. Jaboma said.

As the anniversary looms, the parties have clashed over travel arrangements. Some families pushed back against Ethiopian's initial proposal to include just two guests per victim. Boeing agreed to cover travel costs for four. Some have said they would rather not travel to the event on Ethiopian Airlines, or that they want to avoid Boeing jets.

"It's going to be the hardest trip I've ever taken," Ms. Eissa said.

A person familiar with Boeing's planning said the company was able to accommodate many of the requests.

Boeing representatives who have worked most closely with the families are making sure other company employees are aware of the crash's emotional toll. "We're telling these stories across Boeing, we're letting [Boeing employees] know, and that there are consequences. That this is a big deal," said Mr. Keating, who also oversees Boeing's charitable activities.

Some of the sharpest conflicts have been with Ethiopian Airlines. Many didn't receive remains for seven months and fault the airline for being slow to sweep the site again when summer rains brought additional bones to the surface.

Last fall, Ethiopian filled in the crater at the site of the plane's impact, burying coffins containing the remains too small to be identified. Families were notified a day or two in advance -- almost nobody was able to make the trip in time to witness what they considered to have been a funeral for the dead.

"We want to know every step," said Konjit Shafi, whose 31-year-old brother Sintayehu -- the family's primary breadwinner -- died in the crash while on his way to a recertification course in Nairobi for his job at an automotive company. "I need them to be closer to the families than this and update us more often."

Ethiopian's Mr. Fisseha said the victims' remains were identified as quickly as possible through DNA tests. "The identification process was really difficult," he said.

Roland Rehhorn and Joan Vincent, whose 24-year-old daughter Angela Rehhorn died in the crash on her way to attend a United Nations meeting on the environment, traveled from their home in Ontario to Washington last year to meet with Boeing executives, including then-CEO Dennis Muilenburg.

"I remember sitting in that room with Dennis Muilenburg, and I remember thinking, 'this is really weird,'" Ms. Vincent said. "I was in conflict sitting there," she said.

"It's kind of confusing," Mr. Rehhorn said. "You're kind of litigating against them, but yet they're there to help."

At the meeting in Washington, family members held enlarged photos of their dead relatives. Paul Njoroge, a Canadian who lost his wife, three young children, and his mother-in-law, displayed only pictures of their caskets. "I told them that the faces of my wife and children did not matter to them," Mr. Njoroge said. "I said they should look at those coffins and think about the pain, anguish and devastation they caused me."

Families of victims are hoping to use a portion of the $50 million Boeing has set aside for community assistance to build a hospital or high school and to improve access to drinking water or electricity for the benefit of local residents near the crash site.

Demoze Wodajo, the top government official for the district, said the community is starting to worry about the delays. "We have been discussing, but Ethiopian is not confirming back whether projects will be implemented or not," he said. "Ethiopian always responds that they will consider the projects."

Though they have agreed to work together for now, the families remain at odds with Boeing. Many relatives have said they want to keep the MAX from ever flying again. Some have met privately with top officials at aviation regulators in the U.S., Canada and Europe to push for stricter scrutiny of the plane. They have blasted Boeing's current and former leaders as culpable for the crashes.

Boeing has already removed Mr. Muilenburg, who led the company during the crashes, and has taken other steps aimed at strengthening its engineering and safety processes. Still, some family members have publicly called for new Chief Executive David Calhoun or other board members to resign.

Several remain skeptical of the company's motives. "Anything being done in honor of our loved ones should not be done as a way for corporations to earn their community badge or rehabilitate their reputation," said Zipporah Kuria of the U.K., whose father died in the crash.

Boeing executives involved in the company's efforts say they aren't trying to score public-relations points, but to ensure the families continue to have a role.

"Sometimes they're angry with us and that's OK, we accept that," said Jennifer Lowe, another Boeing executive who has been working with the families.

World News: Epidemic Sparks Scrutiny Of Labs Handling Pathogens

SHANGHAI -- Scientists at a specialized Wuhan laboratory have been at the forefront of China's response to its continuing coronavirus epidemic, but are drawing attention to risks associated with the expanding global study of deadly pathogens.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology contributed to China's fast identification this year of the outbreak's source as a previously unknown coronavirus. It was a monumental achievement for a government that aims to rival the West in high technology, including bioscience.

Yet, the institute's location at ground zero of the most infectious epidemic in China's modern history has also made it a target for peddlers of alternate theories that humans first contracted the virus as the result of an accident of some kind at the laboratory. Leading scientists in China and internationally have dismissed such views, saying the virus likely originated in wildlife, perhaps bats, before spreading to humans, possibly through a food market in Wuhan.

But biosafety experts agree that as more countries handle deadly and exotic microbes at containment labs like the one in Wuhan, risks of accidents or terrorism are growing. In a rush to open labs that scientists say can appear motivated by national pride, governments on every major continent now handle dangerous pathogens that were once confined to a handful of institutions like the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

"The release of pathogenic microorganisms from high-containment laboratories, such as the pandemic CoV-19, seems more likely in countries without current, historically solidified standards or legislation," says Thomas Binz, who leads biosafety efforts at Switzerland's Federal Office of Public Health.

The showpiece of Wuhan's virology institute is a facility opened in 2017 as the most secure of its kind: Biosafety Level 4, or BSL-4, which means maximum containment of the kind of pathogens that are deadliest to humans. "Infections caused by these microbes are frequently fatal and without treatment or vaccines," according to a CDC description of what belongs in such a lab.

While noting that no international rules govern biosafety, the World Health Organization about two years ago counted 54 high-containment labs in 24 countries. Its list included 31 operational BSL-4s, plus 12 more in some stage of construction, with China, Ivory Coast, Saudi Arabia and South Korea described as new entrants.

Modern BSL-4 labs, which often have a national-defense function and work with a nation's military, feature sealed rooms, special ventilation and rigid procedures for scientists, who work in protective bubble suits usually seen only in Hollywood thrillers.

The one in Wuhan, China's first to handle human pathogens, was engineered by a military contractor for the People's Liberation Army and certified domestically. It has studied HIV, Ebola and now Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus discovered in the city.

James W. Le Duc, a former CDC biosafety expert who runs a biocontainment facility at the University of Texas in Galveston, says two of the Wuhan institute's scientists trained with him, and his engineering team visited China to advise "how to drive the place and keep it safe."

Despite careful protocols, accidents happen. The CDC says that in 2014, tubes being used in a study of live Ebola virus in its Atlanta BSL-4 facility got mixed up and the wrong ones were mistakenly transferred to a less-secure lab, though no one got sick.

The CDC says it developed the world's first BSL-4 facility in a truck trailer in 1967 in response to the emergence of Marburg virus, a close cousin of Ebola. Among the U.S.'s 10 BSL-4 labs designed to handle microbes harmful to humans is the CDC's biggest yet, a $480 million, 95,000-square-foot, high-containment lab in Atlanta.

East is East: Hindu Supremacism Turns Deadly in Delhi

Deadly riots in Delhi last month killed at least 44 people, most of them Muslim, and raised the prospect of heightened conflict between India's 966 million Hindu majority and its 172 million Muslims. But the violence also highlights another domestic fissure: between Hindus who back religious pluralism and their coreligionists who are bent on asserting their supremacy in what they see as their homeland.

This isn't a new divide, though its recent deepening could threaten India's stability. For close to 100 years Hindus have faced a choice between the inclusiveness of Mahatma Gandhi (1869-1948) and the tribal appeal of Hindu nationalism's chief ideologue, Vinayak Savarkar (1883-1966). Savarkar espoused the idea that India belongs to followers of so-called Indic faiths, that is, those that originated in the subcontinent. This casts Muslims and Christians as inherently at odds with Indianness, no matter how long they or their ancestors have lived on Indian soil.

In Savarkar's view, Muslim and Christian Indians form a kind of fifth column because their holy lands are not the same as their fatherland. By contrast, both Gandhi and India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, espoused civic nationalism, which views all Indians as equal regardless of their faith.

Long consigned to the margins of national life, Savarkar's ideas find many takers in India today, particularly in the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. But though the idea of civilizational conflict with the Abrahamic faiths may appeal to die-hard Hindu nationalists, it's not clear that it offers a viable way to govern a country in which 1 in 5 Indians is not Hindu.

The recent violence in Delhi -- the worst outbreak in the city since anti-Sikh riots killed more than 3,000 people in 1984 -- is a manifestation of this ideological schism. Muslims are participants in the debate, and bore the brunt of the violence, but the real battleground is among Hindus for the simple reason that they make up four-fifths of India's population. If Savarkar's ideas prevail among the majority, India will cease to be a land that strives to treat its minorities fairly. It will become more like the rest of the subcontinent, where religious minorities often live on the majority's sufferance.

Ironically, the controversial citizenship law that sparked the bloodletting in Delhi, which coincided with a visit by President Trump, recognizes the shoddy record of minority rights in India's near abroad. The law, enacted in December, for the first time introduces a religious test for citizenship by allowing followers of six faiths from Muslim majority Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who arrived in India before 2015 to fast-track naturalization. The law pointedly excludes all Muslims -- including Pakistan's persecuted Ahmadiyya Muslims and Shia Hazara minority.

Since December, Muslims, secularists and students have protested the law. They fear that combined with a proposed (and currently deferred) national register of citizens, the new law will force Indian Muslims to produce documentation proving their citizenship, or risk disenfranchisement or being herded into detention camps. Such documentation isn't ubiquitous in India and it's likely that legal citizens will be caught up in the fray. Such a process, riddled with sloppiness, inconsistencies and casual cruelty, is already under way in the northeastern state of Assam.

In the run up to the violence, BJP leaders gave incendiary speeches and compared the protesters to traitors who deserved to be shot. Skirmishes between stone-throwing Hindu and Muslim mobs quickly devolved into deadly violence in which dozens of people were hacked, burned and shot dead. Mobs razed scores of small businesses. Thousands of people have fled their homes in fear.

BJP supporters point out that both Hindus and Muslims suffered in the violence. A rough count based on the official list of victims' names suggests that more than a quarter of the 44 killed were Hindu. In some neighborhoods, Hindus suffered disproportionately at the hands of Muslim mobs. Those killed included a police constable and a young intelligence officer.

All this may be true, but no reasonable person can view this as a contest of equals. The police in Delhi, overwhelmingly Hindu and under the command of the BJP's hard-line Home Minister, Amit Shah, did not even pretend to be evenhanded. In some places they reportedly stood down instead of confronting mobs. In others, there's evidence they actively abetted Hindu rioters.

A sensible government would work out a way to show compassion for persecuted religious minorities in India's neighborhood without stoking fears among Indian Muslims. A responsible ruling party would not confuse legitimate political protest with treason. But that would mean rejecting Savarkar's pernicious idea that Hindus are somehow more Indian than those who hold other faiths -- something Prime Minister Modi appears unwilling to do.

U.S. News: One Case Dogs Prosecutor Race

CHICAGO -- The primary campaign for Chicago's top prosecutor has been a fight over bail reform, gun control and when to press charges against shoplifters, but the race might come down to one issue: Jussie Smollett.

A trio of Democrats vying for the job have hammered incumbent Cook County state's attorney Kim Foxx for months on her record. But a focus on her handling of what authorities say was Mr. Smollett's bogus claim of a hate crime have contributed to a drop in her polling numbers and threatened to upend her re-election.

In January of last year, Mr. Smollett, an actor from the Fox television show "Empire," claimed two men attacked him while using pro-Trump, racist and antigay slurs. The story soon unraveled as investigators determined Mr. Smollett knew the alleged attackers. He was charged with 16 counts of disorderly conduct -- counts that were ultimately dropped by Ms. Foxx's office.

Since then, a special prosecutor was assigned to reinvestigate both Mr. Smollett and Ms. Foxx's handling of the case.

Last month, the special prosecutor reindicted Mr. Smollett on six counts of disorderly conduct. He pleaded not guilty to the charges.

The investigation into Ms. Foxx is ongoing. She has been criticized for talking with a member of the Smollett family and connecting them with police investigators soon after he made his claims, actions which led her to recuse herself from the case. She was criticized again when her office dropped the charges against him, leading to allegations she hadn't actually recused herself.

Ms. Foxx has said she "fell short" on handling of the case by not communicating her decisions to the public, but defended her record more broadly.

"I feel like the voters of Cook County have the opportunity to look at the entirety of my record; and those who have concerns about this case, we've tried to answer them the best that we can," Ms. Foxx said in an interview. "This is one case out of thousands that we have handled."

The Cook County state's attorney is one of the most high-profile prosecutor's offices in the nation with more than 700 lawyers on staff responsible for misdemeanor and felony crimes in Chicago and the surrounding areas.

Ms. Foxx took office in 2016 with a slate of priorities including changing the bail system, decriminalizing marijuana use and prosecuting fewer gun-crime and shoplifting cases in a city known to be one of the most-violent in the country.

During her tenure, Ms. Foxx has prosecuted fewer gun crimes, has cut her use of cash bail and has effectively raised the threshold to $1,000 from $300 for the amount a person must shoplift before they are prosecuted as felons.

Opponents say Ms. Foxx's decisions have led to more dangerous streets as fewer gun arrests go to trial, as alleged criminals are put back on the streets before their trials and as shoplifters are emboldened.

During her tenure shootings have fallen 33% according to the Chicago Police Department, but in the past month gun crimes have increased sharply, giving her opponents fodder. In 2020, there have been 253 shootings compared with 195 in the same period last year.

But the race might come down to a single issue.

"There's only one thing that will define her legacy and that's Jussie Smollett," former city alderman Bob Fioretti, one the candidates challenging Ms. Foxx in the March primary, said in an interview.

"When you blow a big case the public loses confidence in everything you do," Donna More, a primary candidate who is a former assistant Cook Co. state's attorney, said in an interview.

The incumbent's main challenger is Bill Conway, a Navy veteran and former Cook County assistant state's attorney whose self-funded campaign has caused the cost of this year's primary to skyrocket.

Mr. Conway currently has nearly $6 million on hand largely thanks to his father, William Conway, a co-founder of the Carlyle Group hedge fund. The elder Mr. Conway has thus far given $7.5 million to his son's campaign, according to Illinois Sunshine, which tracks money in state politics.

Mr. Conway and his campaign didn't respond to requests for an interview or comment.

Ms. Foxx's re-election committee has $2.5 million on hand, but she has also been supported by a political-action committee funded by a $2 million infusion from billionaire George Soros's Democracy PAC.

Ms. Foxx holds a slight lead over Mr. Conway in the most-recent polling on the race, conducted last month by ALG research, a Democratic public-opinion firm.

The Democratic primary is March 17.

Insurance Tycoon Is Guilty in Bribe Case

Insurance mogul Greg Lindberg was found guilty Thursday on bribery charges after jurors determined he had attempted to bribe North Carolina's insurance commissioner by promising $2 million in campaign donations to obtain favorable regulatory treatment.

A self-proclaimed billionaire, Mr. Lindberg amassed a business empire in recent years, fueled in part by an unusual stream of loans from his insurance companies. He also had become the leading political donor in North Carolina and a major campaign donor nationally.

The judge declined prosecutors' request that Mr. Lindberg be taken into custody immediately, while awaiting sentencing. Mr. Lindberg will choose a judicial district as his base and travel outside it at the discretion of a probation officer while continuing to wear an electronic monitoring device.

The government alleged Mr. Lindberg sought the replacement of a senior regulator who was overseeing his insurers with someone of his own choosing. The move was aimed at getting a clean bill of health for Mr. Lindberg's life insurers, prosecutors argued, so he could make more acquisitions to further expand his conglomerate.

Jurors in federal court in Charlotte, N.C., listened to hours of secret recordings made by North Carolina Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey, who was cooperating with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and had numerous meetings and phone calls with Mr. Lindberg and his co-defendants.

Lawyers for Mr. Lindberg and two co-defendants had argued that the executive believed he was staying within election law as he made contributions to the state's Republican Party, to be forwarded to the commissioner's 2020 re-election effort.

The defense team argued Mr. Lindberg had been wrongfully entrapped by Mr. Causey into making the donations.

One co-defendant, John D. Gray, a consultant, was also found guilty. Another co-defendant John V. Palermo, an executive who worked for Mr. Lindberg's conglomerate, was found not guilty.

Jurors found Messrs Lindberg and Gray guilty of two related criminal offenses. One of the two charges could bring a maximum of 20 years of jail, and 10 years for the other, but the actual sentences are likely to be lighter.

Lawyers for both Messrs. Lindberg and Gray said they would appeal.

"We think the great weight of the evidence demonstrated this was a setup by a dishonest politician to eliminate a political rival," said Brandon N. McCarthy, one of Mr. Lindberg's lawyers.

"We respect the process, but we believe the jury came to the wrong verdict," said Jack M. Knight Jr., an attorney who represents Mr. Gray.

Brian S. Cromwell, an attorney for Mr. Palermo, said in a statement that evidence introduced at the trial showed that "Mr. Palermo was simply an employee tasked with administrative functions who was in the wrong place at the wrong time."

The case has been widely watched since indictments were unsealed in April 2019, in part because the case entangled North Carolina's Republican Party.

A fourth defendant, Robin Hayes, a former congressman and former chairman of the state GOP party, pleaded guilty last October to a single count of lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mr. Hayes allegedly agreed to take Mr. Lindberg's donations to the state party and forward them to Mr. Causey's campaign. He awaits sentencing.

Mr. Lindberg bought life insurers in the U.S. and abroad beginning in 2014. He then lent at least $2 billion of their assets to entities he controlled, in an unconventional strategy that began before Mr. Causey took office.

After Mr. Lindberg's indictment, North Carolina regulators took control of four of the insurers. Those insurers have since asked a state court to appoint a receiver over hundreds of Mr. Lindberg's private entities that owe them money.

A separate federal probe is continuing to investigate potential fraud in Mr. Lindberg's business dealings, filings show.

In court Thursday, a prosecutor said as much as $1 billion of insurance proceeds were "missing or unaccounted for." He also noted that Mr. Lindberg had sent $3.8 million to 11 women from countries such as Russia and Ukraine in the past 18 months.

A spokesman for Mr. Lindberg said allegations of a financial hole are "totally false." He said Mr. Lindberg doesn't know where the government got 11 women. Mr. Lindberg paid $3 million to three U.S.-domiciled women who were egg donors, the spokesman said, while another $800,000 was paid to an employee of one of Mr. Lindberg's non-U.S. businesses.

Mr. Causey, who was on the witness stand for five days, said he "is relieved" the trial is over. He said he is focused on salvaging as much value as possible in the insurers.

"There is still the possibility that there are buyers are out there" to acquire them, he said.

The defense lawyers sought to persuade the jurors that the government overstepped boundaries prohibiting authorities from inducing people into wrongdoing. Such entrapment can occur when a person with no intent to commit a crime is persuaded by law-enforcement officers or their agents to commit the offense.

Mr. Lindberg's lawyers contended that Mr. Causey had strong motivation to entrap Mr. Lindberg, who had been a major supporter of the former insurance commissioner, Wayne Goodwin, a Democrat. Mr. Causey narrowly defeated Mr. Goodwin in November 2016 and faces him in his re-election bid in November.

In multiple recordings, jurors heard Messrs. Lindberg and Gray criticize the deputy commissioner who was overseeing the Lindberg insurers and whom they wanted replaced. They told the commissioner they supported robust and stringent regulation, but contended that the deputy was ill-qualified to understand the insurers' investments.

Police Tie Crime Rise To New Bail Law

New York Police Department officials said Thursday that overall crime in New York City rose by 22.5% in February, attributing the increase to a new law that eliminates bail for defendants accused of low-level and nonviolent offenses.

The biggest increase in crime involved stolen vehicles. In February, 493 were stolen, a 61.6% rise from the 305 during the same time a year earlier, according to newly released NYPD data.

The city also recorded 1,413 assaults in February, a 9.2% rise from 1,294 during the same time last year, NYPD data showed. There were 45 shootings last month, a 7.1% increase from 42 in February 2019. Murders were down 20% in February, and rapes decreased by 6% last month, according to NYPD data.

A state bail law that went into effect on Jan. 1 requires judges to free defendants accused of misdemeanors or nonviolent felonies. In a statement Thursday, the NYPD said that "criminal justice reforms serve as a significant reason New York City has seen this uptick in crime."

NYPD officials said since the beginning of 2020, 483 people who had already been arrested for a felony crime were rearrested for committing 846 additional crimes.

To address the crime increase, the NYPD is redeploying officers and moving some people from administrative roles.

"Victims are who this is all about -- finding justice for anyone who's already been victimized, trying our hardest to prevent future crimes and future victims," NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said at a news conference Thursday.

The Legal Aid Society, which supports the bail law and represents criminal defendants, said the police department was manipulating its data.

U.S. News: ICE Agents Sent To Sanctuary Cities

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is ramping up its enforcement efforts in 10 sanctuary cities, redeploying 500 investigators to increase surveillance and help arrest people living in the country illegally.

These agents, who typically work on complex long-term investigations, have been reassigned by ICE leadership to assist in the operation, set to run through the end of the year in cities that decline to assist in federal immigration enforcement, including New York, Chicago and San Francisco.

Agents with Homeland Security Investigations, a law-enforcement agency within ICE, began to be pulled off active investigations at the Justice Department in the past week -- including those focusing on human trafficking, child pornography and cybercrime cases -- and redeployed to the initiative.

The redeployment was reported earlier by the New York Times.

The shift comes weeks after a separate decision to temporarily redeploy 100 officers and agents with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including several tactical border patrol units, to assist with the arrest operation.

Henry Lucero, who heads Enforcement and Removal Operations, the ICE arm that carries out deportations, said the need for increased personnel to arrest immigrants in sanctuary communities is a direct response to policies preventing local officials from notifying ICE when they plan to release unauthorized immigrants from law-enforcement custody.

ICE's arrest efforts have been stymied in recent years by uncooperative police agencies and by immigration advocates' efforts to inform people about their rights in such situations.

Sanctuary jurisdictions -- cities and states that restrain their law-enforcement officials' ability to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement -- argue the administration's focus on them is discriminatory and that greater coordination with ICE would discourage immigrants from working with local law-enforcement, making their communities less safe.

The dispute between these jurisdictions and the Trump administration has escalated in recent months.

Mortgage Rates Fall To Lowest Level Ever

Mortgage rates fell to their lowest level on record Thursday, pulled down by fears that the spread of coronavirus could weigh on the U.S. economy.

The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 3.29% from 3.45% last week, mortgage-finance giant Freddie Mac said. Mortgage rates are closely linked to yields on the 10-year Treasury, which this week dropped below 1% for the first time following an emergency Federal Reserve rate cut.

A decline in mortgage rates typically boosts home sales. But a worsening coronavirus epidemic and the efforts to contain it -- quarantines, business shutdowns and travel restrictions -- could keep would-be home buyers on the sidelines during what is usually a busy spring selling season.

The greater Seattle area, home to the first major U.S. coronavirus outbreak and one of the country's hottest housing markets, could offer some clues about what is to come, said Tendayi Kapfidze, chief economist at loan-comparison website LendingTree.

"If people don't want to go out and see houses, that's going to put a damper on demand," Mr. Kapfidze said.

If the virus hobbles the U.S. economy as it has China's, workers could lose their paychecks -- albeit temporarily -- and their ability to make big purchases.

The shutdown of many Chinese factories already has disrupted the supply chains of some U.S. companies, including home builders. That is a problem in a market that is already short on supply, said Realtor.com senior economist George Ratiu.

There are "barely enough homes for sale to last three months at the current sales pace," he said. (News Corp, parent of The Wall Street Journal, operates Realtor.com under license from the National Association of Realtors.)

Already, signs of a slowdown are appearing in the housing market. Low rates pushed home sales to a high mark for the year in December. But existing home sales fell in January from a month earlier, an indication that cheaper borrowing costs are no longer enough to overcome five straight months of rising home prices and limited housing supply.

For now, though, plenty of buyers are using the opportunity to refinance and buy.

Charles and Thomas Porter of Raleigh, N.C., took advantage of falling rates to save on their mortgage payments twice. They refinanced about a year ago with online mortgage company Better.com to cut their 30-year fixed rate to 3.5% from 4.375% and to get rid of mortgage insurance.

Now, they are in the process of buying a four-bedroom house in Charlotte. Charles Porter, who works for a home-building company, and Thomas Porter, who works in pharmaceutical research, locked in a rate of 3.125%, also with Better.com.

The lower rate "helped us feel confident in the move," Thomas Porter said.

The decline in rates is likely to continue to fuel a refinancing frenzy that pushed mortgage lending to its highest level since 2006 last year. About 14.5 million homeowners would benefit from refinancing if 30-year rates hit 3.25%, just below their current level, according to mortgage-data firm Black Knight Inc.

Refinancing applications were up 26% from the previous week and more than 200% from the same time last year, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data released Wednesday.

The jump in refinancings poses a challenge for banks and other mortgage lenders, which often hire staff when the housing market picks up each spring.

"You can never anticipate a drop like this, and there's no way you can staff up fast enough," said Esther Phillips, senior vice president of sales at Key Mortgage Services Inc.

Some homeowners and real-estate agents have complained of delays in closing their mortgages in recent weeks.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. moved some of its home-equity employees to the mortgage business last week to handle an increase in purchase applications and maintain its closing window.

This week, the bank paused email marketing campaigns on refinancing because of high application numbers, said Chase Home Lending Chief Marketing Officer Amy Bonitatibus. Chase is encouraging people to complete their applications online, she said.

Wells Fargo & Co., the largest mortgage lender in the U.S. by originations, said it has been hiring people to underwrite, process and close mortgages to meet demand.

Lenders can control the influx by holding their rates at a level that will attract a manageable number of applications. During those periods, mortgage rates tend to fall slower than the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, widening the gap between them. On Thursday, that gap widened to 2.19 percentage points, its biggest since February 2009, according to an analysis by Dow Jones Market Data.

Still, many say lenders are better equipped to handle a rush of mortgage demand than last year, when the refinancing boom caught many off guard.

"This year maybe they are in a position to capitalize on it better than they were in 2019," said John Toohig, head of the group that trades whole loans, including mortgages, at Raymond James Financial Inc.

Big Labor's Big Crooks

Another day, another United Auto Workers official charged with stealing from his union. On Thursday federal prosecutors accused former UAW president Gary Jones of participating in a conspiracy to embezzle more than $1 million in dues money, among other alleged crimes. The details would make Jimmy Hoffa blush.

The feds say that for years Mr. Jones and "other senior UAW officials" filed fraudulent expense reports seeking union reimbursement for "leadership and training conferences." But instead of legitimate union purposes, hundreds of thousands of dollars went to "lavish entertainment and personal spending for the conspirators," prosecutors claim. Mr. Jones allegedly spent $13,000 on cigars, and the feds say union money also paid for golf outings, high-end booze, spa services, amusement-park tickets, luxury condominiums and villas, and meals at pricey restaurants. Mr. Jones declined to comment through his lawyer.

The feds have spent years investigating corruption at the UAW, which represents some 400,000 active members from more than 600 locals nationwide. Mr. Jones is the highest-ranking former official charged to date, but 13 others have pleaded guilty in connection with the probe, including two former UAW vice presidents and other senior officials.

The UAW scandal is the latest, but such corrupt labor practices are widespread. The Labor Department audits unions, and in 2016 nearly one in five such inspections led to a criminal case. Imagine if 20% of all investigations of business ended up with a criminal charge. Democrats would be going wild with hearings about the moral crisis of capitalism.

Since Jan. 1, 2019, at least 60 labor officials and staffers have been convicted or pleaded guilty for union-related crimes, according to Department of Labor data. With few exceptions, their victims were hard-working, dues-paying union members.

Last month a jury found John Romero guilty of stealing nearly $800,000 from the health plan fund of the United Industrial Services Workers of America, where he was president. Union money helped pay off the loan on a Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 for Mr. Romero's son, among other items.

Audonus Duplessis, the former president of the union representing employees of the Smithsonian Institution and the Kennedy Center, pleaded guilty last fall to using union cash to pay for an online dating service, a Smith & Wesson handgun, and Armani clothes.

Keith Ludlum, also a former union president, pleaded guilty in January to embezzling more than $200,000 from United Food and Commercial Workers International Union Local 1208. Prosecutors said some of the money went toward trips to SeaWorld, a resort in the Dominican Republic and a shopping spree at Michael Kors. The list goes on.

Keep this shameful record in mind when Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden say they want Congress to repeal right-to-work laws in 27 states. They claim they want to protect workers. But both candidates would lock workers into union membership, and coerced dues payments, even when their labor bosses are crooks and thieves. Workers should have the ability to look after their own interests and opt out of paying dues, since union leaders are too often in it for themselves.

U.S. News: Biden Tax Proposal Would Hit Top 1%

WASHINGTON -- Former Vice President Joe Biden would raise taxes by $4 trillion over a decade, concentrating those higher levies on top earners, according to a study of his tax proposals.

Mr. Biden, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, would increase federal taxes by about 8% as a whole, but the effects would vary sharply by income group, according to the analysis released on Thursday by the Tax Policy Center, a Washington research group run by a former Obama administration official.

The top 1% of households would pay 74% of the additional taxes and they would see their after-tax income drop by 17% in 2021. That would be an average tax increase of nearly $300,000. Middle-income households would see tax increases averaging $260 in 2021, mostly because of the indirect effects of corporate tax increases. That would be less than 0.5% of after-tax income.

A Biden economic adviser said the candidate was committed to not raising taxes on the middle class and questioned how much effect corporate taxes have on workers.

The Biden tax plan, rolled out piecemeal throughout his campaign, is significantly smaller than the one offered by his rival for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. It would still mark a reversal of many of the tax cuts that President Trump signed in 2017 and includes proposals that the Obama administration could never get through Congress.

Mr. Biden would raise the top individual tax rate to 39.6% from 37% and limit deductions for people earning over $400,000.

People would have to pay income taxes on unrealized gains at death. That would change current law, which exempts those gains and imposes taxes only on the difference between the value at death and the value when later sold by heirs.

Capital gains would be taxed at the same rates as ordinary income for taxpayers with incomes above $1 million. Social Security taxes would apply to wages and self-employment income over $400,000, rather than being capped at $137,700 as they are this year.

The corporate tax rate would rise to 28% from 21%. Companies would also face a minimum tax of 15% on their global profit on financial statements as well as higher taxes on their foreign earnings.

The Biden plan includes some targeted tax cuts, including some to encourage retirement savings and purchases of electric vehicles. The Biden plan doesn't include some staples of other Democratic tax proposals, such as higher estate taxes, higher payroll taxes to pay for family leave programs and expansions of the child tax credit for low-income households.

The estimates assume that individual tax cuts would lapse as scheduled at the end of 2025, which would mean tax increases for most households. Democrats haven't taken a firm position on what to do then, but most generally say they don't want to raise taxes on middle-income households. Preventing that tax increase would lower the $4 trillion estimate, likely by several hundred billion dollars.

The center hasn't released full estimates of the Sanders tax plan, which calls for higher corporate taxes than those in Mr. Biden's plan and proposes an annual wealth tax.

Ex-UAW Leader Accused of Embezzling

A federal corruption investigation targeting United Auto Workers leaders has led to charges against its highest-ranking official yet: an ex-union president accused of stealing union funds to pay for private villas, expensive cigars, golf outings and other luxuries.

Federal prosecutors accused Gary Jones, the former head of the 400,000-member union, of conspiring with other senior UAW officials to embezzle more than $1 million and covering up the alleged misconduct with fake receipts and fraudulent expense reports, according to charging documents filed with a federal court in Michigan and made public on Thursday.

The 63-year-old Mr. Jones, who was named president in 2018, most recently led the UAW through contract talks with the Detroit car makers last fall and a 40-day strike at General Motors Co.

The charges are the latest escalation in the government's probe and come as the 84-year-old union is struggling to reverse membership declines and win back the trust of rank-and-file workers, whose confidence in senior leadership has been dented by the expanding federal investigation.

An attorney for Mr. Jones declined to comment. The UAW in a statement Thursday condemned the alleged actions by Mr. Jones and other former union officials who have been convicted in the probe.

Prosecutors said the alleged misconduct, spanning from 2010 to last September, was part of a racketeering scheme that violated federal laws.

In court filings, investigators alleged that a group of UAW officials, including Mr. Jones, established master accounts with hotels and resorts that they represented as serving union business, including paying for conferences and meetings. But the accounts were used to pay for personal use of private villas, high-end liquor, golf outings and other luxuries, prosecutors said.

Mr. Jones is also accused of benefiting from a scheme in which UAW officials wrote and cashed fake checks from accounts funded by UAW membership dues, prosecutors said.

He is now the 14th person charged in the federal probe, which became public in July 2017 and has resulted in more than a dozen convictions, including those of two former UAW vice presidents.

The misconduct prosecutors uncovered illustrates a pattern of longtime corruption among the union's top ranks, according to Matthew Schneider, the U.S. attorney in eastern Michigan.

The probe could potentially result in federal oversight of the union, Mr. Schneider said.

The government last put a major union under oversight in 1989, when it began monitoring the International Brotherhood of Teamsters to sever the union's ties with organized crime. That process saw the union institute democratic reforms that could provide an example for the UAW, Mr. Schneider said Thursday.

"It could possibly be a good model here," he said.

Mr. Jones resigned abruptly late last year as the UAW's governing board sought to remove him over allegations he and another top union official provided false and misleading expense reports to the accounting department. At the time, his lawyer said Mr. Jones was voluntarily resigning.

The alleged embezzlement scheme described by prosecutors took different forms and included senior UAW officials spending $290,000 in union funds on luxury condos and villas, restaurants, golf outings, spa treatments and amusement parks.

In one instance in 2015, Mr. Jones allegedly used union money to order $13,000 worth of premium Dominican cigars, such as Ashton Double Magnum and Monarch Tubos cigars, and then reported the purchases as expenses for a regional conference, according to the charging documents.

The federal investigation had initially focused on misuse of funds for training UAW workers at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, resulting in the conviction of a former top labor-relations executive at the company and several UAW officials. Fiat Chrysler has said the misconduct was perpetrated by a small group of individuals acting in their own interest.

The probe subsequently expanded as the government netted more convictions, eventually implicating higher-ranking UAW officials.

Federal agents searched Mr. Jones's home in suburban Detroit last summer, weeks before the union was to start negotiating new labor agreements, covering about 150,000 factory workers at GM, Fiat Chrysler and Ford Motor Co.

As negotiations were set to begin with GM in September, some UAW board members were pressing for Mr. Jones's removal, people familiar with the matter have said. But it wasn't until November -- after leading a historic 40-day strike at GM -- that he decided to step back.

Mr. Jones joined the UAW as a worker at a Ford glass plant in Oklahoma. He later served as the union's chief accountant before being elected to lead the UAW's now-defunct Region 5, which was based in Missouri and covered Southern and Western states.

Vance Pearson, a former UAW board member and close associate of Mr. Jones, pleaded guilty last month to the racketeering charges -- a sign federal prosecutors are considering a broader federal racketeering case against the union that could expose it to government oversight, people familiar with the matter have said.

Current UAW President Rory Gamble, who was elected by the board to succeed Mr. Jones, has vowed to root out malfeasance in the union. As part of that effort, he moved to close the Missouri offices once led by Messrs. Jones and Pearson. He has also sought to expel eight other former UAW officials charged in the investigation.

U.S. News: Schumer Walks Back Comments on Justices

WASHINGTON -- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he regretted his remarks about two Trump-appointed Supreme Court justices "paying the price" for their potential rulings on abortion, adding they weren't intended as a physical threat.

"I'm from Brooklyn. We speak in strong language," the New York Democrat said on the Senate floor Thursday. "I shouldn't have used the words I did, but in no way was I making a threat," he said.

"Of course I didn't intend to suggest anything other than political and public-opinion consequences for the Supreme Court," he said, "and it is a gross distortion to imply otherwise."

Mr. Schumer was addressing an outcry over comments he made Wednesday about Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh at a rally outside the court, while the justices heard oral arguments over a Louisiana abortion law.

"I want to tell you, Gorsuch. I want to tell you, Kavanaugh. You have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price." Mr. Schumer said at the rally. "You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions."

Republicans and others criticized Mr. Schumer over the comments. Earlier Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) admonished Mr. Schumer over the comments on the Senate floor.

"There is nothing to call this except a threat. And there is absolutely no question to whom it was directed," Mr. McConnell said. "He literally directed the statement to the justices, by name."

Chief Justice John Roberts, who in 2018 spoke out against President Trump's verbal attacks on federal judges, also had criticized Mr. Schumer's remarks.

"Justices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous. All Members of the Court will continue to do their job, without fear or favor, from whatever quarter," the statement said.

American Bar Association President Judy Perry Martinez echoed the chief justice's concerns, saying the legal organization was deeply troubled by Mr. Schumer's remarks.

"Whatever one thinks about the merits of an issue before a court, there is no place for threats -- whether real or allegorical," she said.

Some Democrats said they were pleased Mr. Schumer had addressed the issue and contrasted his approach with that of Mr. Trump.

"That's not the Chuck Schumer that I know," said Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), referring to his initial comments. "I'm glad he has apologized from this standpoint: Don't let the president bring you down to his level, and that type of toxicity. We're better than that."

Supreme Court justices have been in the political crosshairs recently. During a visit to India last month, the president said Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg should recuse themselves from cases involving him.

In November 2018, Chief Justice Roberts rebutted comments from President Trump disparaging federal courts in California, including his characterization of a jurist who ruled against the administration as an "Obama judge."

Free Speech for Lawyers

The Supreme Court on Friday will entertain a petition to extend the logic of its 2018 Janus decision that struck down compulsory public union fees to state bar associations. This subject is ripe for High Court review, but Justices should wait for a stronger case that is coming soon.

Attorney Arnold Fleck is challenging North Dakota's mandate that lawyers join and pay dues to the state bar association. Thirty-two or so states have similar laws, and several are now being litigated. Some conservatives are urging the Court to hear the Fleck case, but it is not an ideal vehicle for extending Janus.

Mr. Fleck filed his lawsuit in 2015, so his arguments draw more on the Court's pre-Janus decisions that didn't directly address whether states could compel non-union workers to subsidize union advocacy. Importantly, Janus held that government union positions in collective bargaining are inherently political because they implicate matters of public interest.

The same logic applies to bar association dues that support regulation of the legal profession. States can mandate bar-association membership because the Court in Lathrop (1961) mistakenly reasoned that First Amendment association rights were not at stake because attorneys do not have to attend meetings or vote in elections.

In Keller (1990), the Court applied the Court's faulty Abood reasoning -- which Janus overturned -- by declaring that attorneys may not be compelled to subsidize a bar association's political lobbying but can still be forced to support its legal activities. Bar associations commonly use attorney dues to take positions on issues such as tort and judicial campaign reform.

Mr. Fleck quibbles that North Dakota's bar does not "affirmatively" require attorney consent to subsidize its political lobbying. According to his petition for the Court to hear the case, the bar association directs attorneys to pay $380 and "in small print" at the bottom of a form says they "may deduct $1.45" if they don't wish to support its political advocacy.

Attorneys, he says, should instead be charged $378.55 and have to add the $1.45 if they wish to support the bar's politics. But he's missing Janus's fundamental point. Even bar legal advocacy implicates matters of public concern and therefore impinges on attorney speech rights. Mr. Fleck shouldn't be compelled to join the bar or pay it a penny.

A more straightforward challenge to mandatory bar fees is percolating in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, where Wisconsin attorneys Adam Jarchow and Michael Dean are seeking to overturn the Court's Keller and Lathrop precedents in Jarchow v. State Bar of Wisconsin.

The two have compiled a long list of political expenses that have been funded by attorney bar dues including advocacy for juvenile justice reform, abortion coverage for exchange health plans, restoring felon voting rights and public financing of state Supreme Court campaigns. The Wisconsin bar has also opposed unemployment insurance fraud reforms, the death penalty and some state immigration laws.

States can regulate the legal profession without infringing on attorney First Amendment rights, they argue, and 18 states have done so. The Wisconsin case would provide a clean vehicle for the Supreme Court to address the constitutionality of bar-association dues without getting tripped up by Fleck's arcane argument over dues waivers.

It's important that the Court applies its constitutional reasoning in Janus to all circumstances in which governments compel individuals to join organizations and support political speech. The Court would do better to hold off on Fleck for now and wait for the stronger factual and legal evidence from Wisconsin.

World News: U.S. Faces Court's Afghan-War Investigation

The International Criminal Court ruled that its chief prosecutor could investigate alleged war crimes in Afghanistan that may have been committed by U.S. and other forces, deepening a confrontation with the Trump administration.

The appellate ruling Thursday allows prosecutors of the court, created under an international treaty but never recognized by Washington, to move ahead with investigations of actions during the lengthy conflict by the U.S., the Central Intelligence Agency, Afghan forces, the Taliban and the Taliban-aligned Haqqani network.

The U.S. has long opposed such an investigation, saying it could place U.S. personnel at risk of punitive action by an international body. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Thursday's decision "a truly breathtaking action by an unaccountable political institution masquerading as a legal body."

He said the timing, days after the U.S. government and the Taliban signed an agreement designed to lead to a lasting peace, is "all the more reckless." Mr. Pompeo said the U.S. government will take all necessary measures to protect its people against any action by prosecutors.

The U.S. last year announced visa restrictions against ICC officials involved in the probe and warned that prosecutions could imperil U.S. personnel and American allies.

The Trump administration had welcomed the court's rejection last year of the 2017 request by ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda to investigate possible crimes committed since May 2003 in Afghanistan. The judges in a pretrial chamber had ruled that an investigation "would not serve the interests of justice."

But the appellate ruling said that the pretrial chamber shouldn't have considered the "interests of justice factor," but only whether there was a reasonable factual basis to proceed and whether it was in the court's jurisdiction.

In a statement, the Afghan government said war crimes are still being committed by the Taliban, while Kabul has addressed wrongdoing in its own ranks, including by prosecuting those responsible. A signatory to the treaty that created the ICC, Afghanistan said it would cooperate with the ICC chief prosecutor's office.

The chief prosecutor, Ms. Bensouda, in a statement welcomed the appellate decision, and said the investigation will be "independent, impartial and objective." Ms. Bensouda said her office would provide formal notice to the relevant parties.

The appellate decision drew praise from international advocacy organizations.

Solomon Sacco, head of international justice at Amnesty International, called it "the first true hope of justice for the victims of conflict, who have been shamefully ignored for years, including in the recent peace agreement that has nothing to say about the crimes committed against them."

Jamil Dakwar, director of the human rights program at the American Civil Liberties Union, said of Mr. Pompeo's comments: "No one except the world's most brutal regimes win when the United States tries to disparage and sabotage international institutions established to hold human rights abusers accountable."

Ms. Bensouda spent years collecting information on the Afghan war and potential crimes on all sides.

Prosecutors said in 2017 that they had information that provided a reasonable basis to believe that U.S. armed forces and CIA members "committed acts of torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity, rape and sexual violence against conflict-related detainees in Afghanistan and other locations."

The U.S. isn't a signatory to the ICC, which began its work in The Hague in 2002 as a court of last resort for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, when national justice systems can't or won't take action.

Mr. Pompeo, who said the Afghan government had urged the ICC not to take this action, accused the body of political motives and disputed the factual basis for the decision.

REVIEW --- What We Can Learn From the 20th Century's Deadliest Pandemic --- In 1918, the Spanish flu killed more than 50 million people around the world. The lessons of that outbreak could save countless lives in the fight against the coronavirus.

Corrections & Amplifications

Commercial radio broadcasts in the U.S. began in 1920. A Review article Saturday about the 1918 flu pandemic incorrectly said that radio broadcasts were focused on war news in 1918.

(WSJ March 11, 2020)

(END)

The "Spanish" flu of 1918 was one of the deadliest pandemics in human history. Seeming to come from nowhere in the waning days of World War I, it spread through a war-ravaged world like wildfire. In a matter of months, a third of the world's population was infected, 50 to 100 million people died, and the global economy shrank by 5%.

The world of 1918 was very different from today's, where the new coronavirus is emerging as another potential pandemic. A century ago, antibiotics, modern hospitals, intensive care units and instant communication did not exist; most people lived in rural communities; intercontinental travel took weeks rather than hours. Now the world's population is four times larger, with more than half living in urban areas. National economies are heavily intertwined because of globalization. Health services are highly sophisticated in wealthy countries, though their quality varies greatly in the rest of the world.

From a public health perspective, however, there are important similarities between the 1918 flu and the 2019 coronavirus. Both were previously unknown viral strains for which there was no existing vaccine or proven medical treatment. Both spread through respiratory droplets and killed primarily by means of pneumonia and other complications. Both caused severe economic disruptions. With the growing risk of a full-blown pandemic, applying the lessons of the 1918 flu could save countless lives in 2020.

Provide effective leadership. In 1918, Philadelphia was one of the hardest-hit American cities, partly because it was, as the muckraker Lincoln Steffens put it, "the worst-governed city in America." In his book "The Great Influenza," the historian John M. Barry describes the efforts of Dr. Wilmer Krusen, director of Philadelphia's Public Health and Charities department, a well-intentioned man who lacked public health experience and was prone to inaction. On Sep. 28, 1918, he allowed the city to proceed with a Liberty Loan parade to sell millions of dollars in war bonds, despite warnings that the event would spread illness. The parade drew 200,000 people; within 72 hours, every bed in the city's 31 hospitals was filled.

By contrast, Mr. Barry shows, St. Louis had the most success of any large American city in fighting the pandemic. Dr. Max Starkloff, the city's health commissioner, said that his goal was to "keep the epidemic out of the city, if possible, and if that fails, to use every means to keep it down to the lowest possible number of cases." He created an advisory body that included representatives of the city's chamber of commerce, schools, medical society, university, Red Cross and local public health services. He pursued what he called "intelligent citizen cooperation" through active outreach to the community. And he engaged health department staff, policy makers and teachers to implement individual quarantines and bans on public gatherings. Thanks to Starkloff's rapid, inclusive and systematic efforts, St. Louis's mortality rate from the flu was half of Philadelphia's.

Leadership mattered even more at the national level. President Woodrow Wilson was so focused on winning World War I that he would not listen to repeated warnings about the pandemic from the chiefs of the Army and Navy, or even from his own personal physician. The U.S. ended up losing 675,000 lives to influenza, compared with 53,000 killed in combat in World War I.

The past century has reinforced the importance of thoughtful, principled, decisive leadership in combating epidemics. Smallpox was officially eradicated in 1980, in what might be the greatest achievement in the history of public health. Dr. D.A. Henderson of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was the tenacious advocate who convinced the World Health Organization to take up the challenge of eliminating smallpox everywhere in the world; he then led the campaign to victory.

In 2003, President George W. Bush launched his Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which was crucial in helping the people of Africa to confront the AIDS epidemic. He announced the program with words of grace and compassion, without blame or judgment: "I propose . . . a work of mercy beyond all current international efforts to help the people of Africa. . . . This nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of nature."

Rely on classic public health measures. In 1918, the lack of national leadership meant that every city and state pursued its own approach to dealing with the epidemic. This created a series of natural experiments that allowed later researchers to assess the effectiveness of different approaches. They found that cities which implemented isolation policies (such as quarantining houses where influenza was present) and "social distancing" measures (such as closing down schools, theaters and churches) saw death rates 50% lower than those that did not. The cities that fared best were the ones that started isolating patients early and continued until the epidemic was unquestionably under control.

In the century since the 1918 outbreak, studies of seasonal flu infections and occasional pandemics have underscored the benefits of hygiene instruction and regular handwashing, which can reduce influenza cases by more than 40%. During the 2009 "swine flu," school closures in Texas reduced acute respiratory illness by 45% to 72%. Such classic public health measures are sometimes as effective as the seasonal flu vaccine, which reduced infections by less than 40% in four of the last 12 U.S. flu seasons.

Give accurate information and build community trust. In every pandemic, people fall prey to stigmatization, distrust and rumor-mongering. The "Spanish" flu, as the 1918 pandemic is still widely known, did not originate in Spain. Rather, because the country was neutral in World War I, its uncensored press was the first to report on the disease. As a result, many around the world blamed the Spanish for the epidemic, and the nickname persists to this day.

As the flu spread in 1918, many communities found scapegoats. Chileans blamed the poor, Senegalese blamed Brazilians, Brazilians blamed the Germans, Iranians blamed the British, and so on. In the U.S., the country's millions of new immigrants had often been stigmatized as disease carriers during previous epidemics, but the 1918 flu struck every social class and every part of the country, so no single ethnic group was blamed for it.

Some populations, though, were more vulnerable to the disease than others. A study of data from 438 U.S. cities, published last year in the journal Economics and Human Biology, found a wide variation in pandemic-related mortality rates, ranging from 211 deaths per 100,000 people in Grand Rapids, Mich., to 807 in Pittsburgh. Half of this difference was attributable to three factors -- poverty, prior health status and urban air pollution. The same will likely be true with the coronavirus, which means that ensuring prevention and care for the most vulnerable is vital for saving lives.

Remarkably, despite the ubiquitous daily horror of the 1918 flu, there were few instances of flu-related attacks or riots. On the contrary, in her book "Pale Rider," the science journalist Laura Spinney finds many examples of good Samaritans. In Alaska, 70-year-old Dr. Valentine McGillycuddy came out of retirement to fight the flu; in Tokyo, doctors went out at night to give free vaccinations to the poor; in Germany, the Catholic Church helped to train young women as nurses.

During pandemics, the reflex to help one another is more common than we might think. At the deadliest moments in 1918, when city governments in the U.S. were overwhelmed, volunteer groups -- from Phoenix's citizens' committees to Philadelphia's bluebloods -- stepped in to distribute resources to those in need. When communities did lose trust in their leaders, it was often because, in Mr. Barry's words, they had lied about the severity of the pandemic "for the war effort, for the propaganda machine that Wilson had created."

What the public needed was accurate answers to the questions raised by the appearance of an unfamiliar, deadly disease. Where did it come from? How could I get infected? Can I pass it on to others? How can I protect myself and my loved ones?

The historian Nancy Tomes has shown that in 1918, since radio broadcasts and newsreels were focused on war news, people turned to the print media for information on the flu. From trade magazines like Variety to scientific journals such as Survey, journalists asked difficult questions about how the epidemic was being handled and presented the best available answers to their readers. In the face of highly variable responses from public officials, the media served as an essential ally of the public health community in fighting the pandemic.

As we now face the specter of a coronavirus pandemic, it is reasonable to ask: Are we more or less vulnerable today than we were a century ago? In some ways we are clearly better off. We have modern vaccines and medical care, dramatically improved communication tools and healthier, better nourished populations. Modern governments plan in advance for how to respond swiftly to outbreaks, and there are mechanisms in place for international cooperation.

Yet according to the 2019 Global Health Security Index, less than one in five countries is fully prepared for a global pandemic. More than a billion people don't have access to essential prevention services, vaccines and medicines, and most of the world lacks intensive care services capable of handling severe cases of the coronavirus.

And we are vulnerable in other distinctively modern ways. Growing resistance to many antibiotics makes it hard to treat pneumonia and other bacterial complications. Large numbers of people suffer from heart disease, diabetes, cancer and other diseases that weaken the immune system. Rapid international travel has spread the virus at lightning speed. And as we are already seeing with the new coronavirus, globalized supply chains, dependent on just-in-time delivery of medicines, food and other essentials, are vulnerable to disruption in a global pandemic.

This face-off between the factors that reduce our vulnerability and those that increase it leaves humanity at considerable risk. Thousands, possibly millions, of lives depend on our ability to apply the lessons of 1918 and other pandemics. Only by taking full advantage of scientific and public health advances, investing in strong health systems and developing new technologies to prevent and respond to disease will we be able to meet the challenge of the new coronavirus -- and the other outbreaks that will inevitably follow.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
The 'No Bail' Fiasco in New York

You know New York has a problem when even Mayor Bill de Blasio admits it. On Thursday the New York Police Department held a press conference to report that major crime is up 22.5% this February over a year ago. Both the cops and the mayor attribute the spike to the bail reform pushed through the state Legislature in Albany last year, which is releasing people who have been arrested for one crime to go out and commit another.

"There's a direct correlation to a change in the law, and we need to address it, and we will address it," Mr. de Blasio said of the increase in crime. The mayor also said he was "absolutely confident" it will be addressed in Albany in the budget due April 1.

The Democratic Legislature, with the backing of both Mr. de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, ended cash bail last year. The goal was to prevent cases such as that of Kalief Browder, a 16-year-old charged with stealing a backpack. Because his family could not afford bail he spent three years in prison on Rikers Island -- much of it in solitary -- without being tried or convicted of a crime. After his release, he ultimately committed suicide.

The sensible part of bail reform was aimed at preventing injustices such as this one. The non-sensible part was to deprive judges of the discretion to keep behind bars criminals who remain a menace to the community.

The law went into effect on Jan. 1, and the NYPD numbers are sobering: "In the first 58 days of 2020, 482 individuals who had already been arrested for committing a serious (felony) crime such as robbery or burglary were rearrested for committing an additional 846 crimes. Thirty-five percent, or 299, were for arrests in the seven major crime categories -- murder, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny and grand larceny auto -- that is nearly triple the amount of those crimes committed in the same 58 days in 2019."

Police Commissioner Dermot Shea underscored the main point: "Each number represents a victim."

Some on the political left, including a coalition of public defenders, claim the cops are deliberately manipulating the figures as "scare tactics." Ditto for Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, who is blaming the New York Post, which refuses to take dictation from the city's progressive powers. Mayor de Blasio is having none of it. "They're wrong," he says.

Another crime problem that Mr. de Blasio doesn't acknowledge is the explosion of minor offenses since the City Council decriminalized such antisocial behavior as urinating in public, smoking marijuana in public, and turnstile jumping on the subways. This creates a culture of tolerance for lawlessness that the bail reform has compounded.

Polls show support for the bail reform dropping fast, and New York's chief judge says it is the only state in which judges do not have the ability to consider whether a defendant poses a credible risk of danger before releasing him. There is a simple fix that would take care of the biggest problem: Give judges the ability to weigh this risk before letting people out. If Albany doesn't fix this, we hope the voters run them all out office.

Cross Country: Spendthrift Illinois Races Toward Default

For 13 years, Puerto Rico has been in a man-made recession aggravated by natural disasters. In 2017 the island territory asked a federal court for bankruptcy protection, but it's still grappling with $70 billion in debt. Puerto Rico's fiscal fiasco offers a glimpse of what the future could hold for Illinois if it doesn't deal with its own self-imposed economic disaster.

Long the economic hub of the Midwest, Illinois has lost more than 850,000 residents to other states during the past decade. The state has been shrinking for six consecutive years and suffered the largest raw population decline of any state in the 2010s. Puerto Rico has been plagued by people problems too, shedding population in nine of the past 10 years.

Like Puerto Rico, Illinois is drowning in a sea of red ink. Growing government debt and a crushing tax burden are depressing economic growth. State spending is up, but personal-income growth is lagging. Since 2000, Illinois's per capita personal income growth has been 21% lower than the national average. Home prices are growing at the second-slowest pace in the nation, at only 2% compared with 5.1% on average nationwide. With speculation that Illinois could be the first state to go into default, ratings firms are paying attention. Illinois's credit rating is one notch above junk.

Shortly before Puerto Rico's bankruptcy filing, The Wall Street Journal described "an exodus of workers, retirees and entire families" fleeing a deepening economic crisis. "For years, Puerto Rico borrowed more -- and incurred higher fixed costs -- to buy time to stave off deeper economic overhauls," according to the Journal report. Creditors and analysts said Puerto Rico's problems were aggravated by "government overspending and promises to unions for employee benefits that officials knew they wouldn't have the resources to properly fund."

The description also fits Illinois, but it doesn't have to. Illinois's public pension payments already consume nearly a third of the state budget, yet the unfunded liability -- which the state currently pegs at $137 billion, though others put the figure much higher -- continues to rise. Local government services are also being squeezed by pensions, contributing to rising property taxes that are the second-highest in the nation. Since 2000, Illinois has increased pension spending by more than 500% but cut by a third services that help students pay for college, protect children from abuse, aid the poor, and fight disease.

Moderate reforms could stabilize Illinois's five state-run and hundreds of local pension funds, but politicians have consistently refused to consider them, preferring instead to increase taxes steadily. Illinois has a culture of trying -- and failing -- to tax its way out of its problems. In 2011 then-Gov. Pat Quinn approved a temporary tax hike aimed at making a dent in the state's $8 billion in unpaid bills. By 2014, Illinois still had a $6.6 billion bill backlog, and lawmakers were calling for families and businesses to give up more money. Another permanent income-tax increase came in 2017, but again more taxes failed to solve Illinois's problems.

The problems, in fact, got worse. In his freshman year, Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed into law 20 new taxes and fees totaling nearly $4.6 billion, including a doubling of the gasoline tax. Now Mr. Pritzker wants a progressive income tax he claims will really solve the issue. He's asking voters to give him a green light on Nov. 3.

Mr. Pritzker is wrong to tell voters that 97% of them "will not see an increase." Because when voters decide whether to push forward his progressive tax, they won't get to vote on rates. As the Illinois Policy Institute reported, solving the pension issue would require a progressive income-tax hike of $10 billion. Mr. Pritzker's current plan to tax $3.7 billion out of the state economy dedicates only $200 million to pensions.

There is hope for the people of Illinois. State pensions can be fully funded, Illinois taxpayers can save $50 billion over 25 years, and dollars can be freed to support their eroding public services. Policy makers can finally shrink Illinois's pension liability by reducing the main driver of its growth: the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA. Currently, the COLA doesn't reflect any actual cost-of-living increase, since it isn't pegged to inflation. By simply replacing the existing guaranteed 3% compounding postretirement raise with a true COLA pegged to inflation, among other modest changes, Illinois can save $2.4 billion in the first year alone. No current retiree would see a decrease in his pension check. Current workers would preserve their core benefit.

Failed fiscal policy has left the Land of Lincoln just a few steps ahead of Puerto Rico, but all isn't lost. Just as Illinois's financial disaster was man-made, so too can be its recovery.

A Court Corrects a Medical Injustice

A once-renowned Kentucky cardiologist is being released from federal prison after an appeals court threw out his health-care fraud conviction because the government withheld critical evidence at his trial.

Richard Paulus was convicted in 2016 of health-care fraud and false statements. After some back-and-forth appeals, he reported to prison last June. He wasn't supposed to be released until September 2023, by which time he would have been 76. But on Thursday the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated his conviction. This decision should bring needed scrutiny to a pattern of dubious criminal prosecutions of doctors that lawyers have come to call "stent cases."

The way these cases work is simple: The government has questions about a cardiologist and shows a sample of his angiograms -- chosen by the government -- to a government-hired doctor. The government doctor reviews the angiograms and tells investigators any time he thinks the doctor gave the patient an unnecessary stent.

The government claimed that Dr. Paulus did this "frequently, repetitive[ly], daily." A trio of government doctors said that between 21% and 50% of the cases they reviewed showed unnecessary stents. The government called this a "pattern" that proved Dr. Paulus was a criminal.

But government doctors are no more reliable than private ones. A difference of opinion on whether or not a stent was necessary is often, well, just that. As one of the judges hearing Dr. Paulus's appeal remarked, the rate at which government doctors differed with Dr. Paulus wasn't an error rate but a "disagreement in medical judgment rate."

What's more, the government failed to disclose evidence to Dr. Paulus's lawyers that showed the disagreement rate was in fact much lower. It wasn't 50% or even 21% but, according to an expert hired by Dr. Paulus's hospital, just 7%.

The government argued during the appeal that its failure to disclose was harmless because a 7% disagreement rate is still too high. It told the court, as it has in all previous stent cases, that where one cardiologist thinks a blockage blocks less than 30% of an artery and another thinks it's above 70%, "somebody is right and somebody is wrong." The government claimed such disagreements "should be zero or close to zero." So, the theory goes, where a trained cardiologist like Dr. Paulus gets it wrong by calling a 30%-or-smaller blockage greater than 70% enough times, he must be a criminal.

But the appellate court rejected the government's argument and announced that Dr. Paulus had a right to know and let the jury decide whether a 7% disagreement rate is enough to diagnose him as a criminal. Indeed, the appellate court wondered itself whether it would have rejected Dr. Paulus's prior appeal had it known this information. How, when the government had known this all along, had Dr. Paulus just been forced to spend nine months in prison?

And so Dr. Paulus is, for the third time since the government targeted him nearly a decade ago, an innocent man in the eyes of the law. If the government elects to retry him, he now has the evidence he needs to show that instead of being a criminal, at worst he may have made, in the court's words, "occasional mistakes or had occasional differences of opinion." As doctors, like all people, sometimes do.

World News: Two Saudi Royal Princes Held, Accused of Plotting a Coup

Saudi Arabian authorities detained two of the kingdom's most prominent figures for an alleged coup attempt, further consolidating the power of the king's son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and clearing away once-formidable rivals to the throne, according to people familiar with the matter.

The detentions occurred early Friday morning when guards from the royal court wearing masks and dressed in black arrived at the homes of the two men, took them into custody and searched their homes, according to people familiar with the matter.

Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz al Saud, a brother of Saudi King Salman, and Prince Mohammed bin Nayef bin Abdulaziz al Saud, the king's nephew known as MBN, were both accused of treason, the people said. The guards also arrested one of MBN's brothers.

The Saudi royal court accused the two men of plotting a coup to unseat the king and crown prince, according to people familiar with the situation.

The two men who potentially had once been in line for the throne are now under threat of lifetime imprisonment or execution, people familiar with the situation said. The details of the alleged coup attempt couldn't be learned.

Prince Ahmed and MBN spent time as minister of the interior, a powerful position with oversight of troops and Saudi Arabia's large intelligence service. MBN had close ties to U.S. intelligence and was respected for his knowledge of security and terror threats in the Middle East. But over the past few years, their standing in the royal family has diminished as King Salman consolidated power and installed his son Mohammed bin Salman -- known as MBS -- as crown prince and the kingdom's day-to-day ruler.

The arrests cast aside two men who could have been rivals to MBS's claim to the throne if 84-year-old King Salman died or decided to abdicate. MBN had been first in line for the throne as King Salman's crown prince until 2017, when MBS was elevated over him.

Early in MBS's ascent, his social and economic reforms pleased many Western officials who had long called for the kingdom to lift restrictions on women and foster a more diversified economy.

But the prince's tactics for cracking down on corruption, silencing dissent and marginalizing rivals have since alienated many in the U.S. and Europe.

To curb corruption, MBS launched a surprise dragnet in 2017 that saw many of the kingdom's most powerful businessmen and royals locked up in the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton Hotel and accused of ripping off the government. Many were released only after agreeing to pay tens of millions of dollars to the royal court.

The next year, Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post, was murdered and dismembered in Turkey by men working for MBS. The backlash presented the biggest threat yet to the crown prince.

In a further crackdown on dissent, Prince Mohammed has arrested online critics and used armies of Twitter accounts to criticize people who question his governance. Men working for him were also accused by the U.S. Justice Department last year of paying two Twitter employees for private information on dissidents.

The arrest of MBN follows sharp bipartisan criticism of Saudi Arabia in the U.S. Congress, where support for the kingdom already has waned because of Mr. Khashoggi's killing and widespread civilian casualties in Yemen caused by a Saudi-led coalition using American-supplied weaponry.

MBN was for years a trusted contact for U.S. security and intelligence officials. As the head of Saudi counterterrorism efforts, he shared information with American counterparts about planned attacks and gained allies throughout the State Department and Central Intelligence Agency.

Many U.S. officials were dismayed by his ouster in 2017, said several former intelligence and State Department officials, since they felt he was the U.S.'s most reliable ally within the royal family.

MBN has been under house arrest for much of the time since MBS stepped in front of him, though he did appear at private events during an investment conference last fall, said people familiar with the matter.

Prince Ahmed's role has been more complicated. Some members of the royal family wanted to see the crown passed to Ahmed, the king's brother, rather than to MBS, people familiar with the matter said.

REVIEW --- The Discontent of Migrants Looms Over China --- The coronavirus has exacerbated the economic divide between middle-class urbanites and the country's rural underclass.

Even as the coronavirus spreads globally, there are some small signs of recovery at its source in China. After unprecedented control efforts -- mass quarantines, blockaded cities, halted transportation -- new reports of infections have slowed. Under government orders, and with the help of low-interest loans, shuttered businesses have begun to resume operations. The online ferment of angry urbanites who had criticized the government's mishandling of the crisis has dwindled for now. Even Starbucks has reopened stores, though only for takeout orders.

So is China set to resume a stable course of growth? Don't count on it. The country could still get hit by a second wave of the virus as the quarantines end, and its all-important export sector will receive a harsh blow later this year as the global economy slows. Worse, the virus has revealed the vulnerability of a pivotal, undervalued part of China's economy -- the hundreds of millions of migrant workers and their relatives in the countryside, who together make up roughly half of the population but have gained far less of the country's wealth.

Migrants are the Achilles' heel of the China growth story. They are still facing unprecedented virus-related disruptions in their lives and work. The majority have seen their incomes dry up, unable in most cases to return to jobs or get their farm goods to market. Industrial workers who have made it back from their villages now face two-week quarantines in factory dorms, with little or no pay, as at the facilities of Apple supplier Foxconn in Zhengzhou and Kunshan. Restaurants and other service-industry businesses, which rely on migrants but are particularly concerned about spreading the virus, have been among the slowest to reopen and rehire.

Even before the virus, migrant workers were increasingly unwelcome in China's cities; millions had started to flow back to the countryside as their opportunities had begun to fade. When a fire in a rundown Beijing apartment building killed 19 of them in 2017, the incident sparked mass evictions of migrants in cities across the country. Now locals who fear the spread of the disease and have long viewed migrants as outsiders -- expressed by the Chinese epithet waidiren -- are blocking their return to neighborhoods. Meanwhile, China's badly skewed health care system relegates most migrants to understaffed and underfunded clinics far from where they work, leaving them particularly vulnerable to the disease's spread.

After years of giving their xuehan -- or "blood and sweat" -- the migrants face an uncertain future. Their wages have gained ground only slightly compared with city dwellers, who still earn about three times as much. Some policy makers see these rising wages as a problem and are pushing for more automated factory floors, with municipalities subsidizing companies that shed workers. The policy is literally called "robots replacing humans."

What does this stark divide mean for China's trajectory? For several decades, most China watchers have shared two core beliefs. The first is that pressure to liberalize the political system would come from the urban elite. With rising living standards and better education, this group would build on the failed efforts of the student protesters of Tiananmen Square, eventually demanding not just better policies on quality-of-life issues like pollution but also real government accountability.

The second belief is that the Chinese economy would continue to be buoyed upward, despite challenges, on the backs of an ever-expanding middle class. McKinsey & Co. has predicted that China's middle and upper classes will rise from 182 million households in 2012 to 303 million by 2022, and multinationals have counted on this growth. China's leaders also have stoked the idea that with urbanization, the country would transition to a more consumption-driven service economy, That, they predict, would end reliance on polluting factories and on excessive investment, which has led total debt in China to surge to a dangerously high level of more than 300% of GDP.

The trouble is, neither belief is true. In 2003, I wrote a commentary piece for Businessweek entitled "How SARS Is Invigorating China's Communists." Now, as then, city residents likely will welcome a strengthening of political and social controls by the central party committee in the aftermath of the new virus. As the political scientists Lynette H. Ong and Donglin Han concluded in a 2018 paper based on survey research, China's middle class is essentially a conservative force. "Those with higher income and education levels have considerably more to lose than the impoverished and poorly educated," they wrote in the journal Political Studies. "The opportunity cost of participating in protest actions, a high-risk activity in authoritarian states, rises as one progresses up the social ladder."

As for the continued expansion of the middle class, that can only happen if China integrates more migrants into economic life and stops treating them as second-class citizens.

Two policies have ensured that they mostly remain outsiders in the cities to which they've moved. One is the household registration policy or hukou, which binds them to their rural homes and bars them and their families from using the better hospitals and schools where they actually work. Second is China's land ownership system, which makes it nearly impossible to make much money from leasing or selling land in the countryside -- a stark contrast with the cities, where sales of apartments have led to an explosion of wealth.

Inequality in China has become a fast-growing and increasingly dangerous problem. Its Gini coefficient -- the standard international measure of inequality -- according to some studies now stands at 0.5, one of the highest in the world. One result of this divide in economic fortunes is that household consumption in China makes up a comparatively small portion of the GDP, currently about 40%.

After repeated promises, officials have done little to reform these policies, worried about the cost of giving migrants better health care and education. City dwellers themselves have no interest in sharing their advantages. One prominent cause of urban protest in recent years has been their opposition to the occasional government effort to bring more migrant children into city schools. Migrants are now increasingly expected to return home to generate wealth, despite the many obstacles there.

In research on life satisfaction in China by the economists John Knight and Ramani Gunatilaka, migrants unsurprisingly reported being less happy than urbanites. Less intuitive is that they were also unhappier than those who remained in the countryside. It's not hard to understand why, says Dee Lee, a Guangzhou --based labor consultant; it's because migrants are more aware than distant farmers that their living standard falls far below that of their urban counterparts. This growing disillusionment contributes to an expanding number of migrant labor strikes.

The coronavirus may eventually fade as a threat, but it has exposed the deep inequities that divide Chinese into two classes, an urban elite and an equally large underclass from the countryside that sees its small gains stalling. That split remains the biggest obstacle to China's development. Rather than ascending to a new urban middle class helping to power China's growth, the country's migrant workers -- left behind, as they are -- pose the biggest threat to its economic and political future.

EXCHANGE --- Heard on the Street: Virus Aftermath Is Not Like a Hurricane --- No roofs to be reshingled; even if recession is avoided, recovery is likely to be U-shaped and uncomfortably long

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

When a hurricane rolls in, a river breaches its levee or suddenly shifting tectonic plates shake the earth, the economy can experience a big hit. The ensuing recovery is often even bigger.

But the coronavirus epidemic is no hurricane. It will weigh on the U.S. and global economy far longer, it won't end with a sudden burst of blue skies and it won't lead to types of rebuilding efforts -- there are no roofs to be reshingled -- that have historically helped the economy bounce back from natural disasters.

The shape of the economy as it absorbs and eventually recovers from the coronavirus epidemic is more likely to be U-shaped than V-shaped -- with a prolonged bottom.

Ever since the scope of the coronavirus epidemic in Wuhan started becoming clearer in January, economists have been cutting their growth forecasts. Early this year, for example, Deutsche Bank forecast that U.S. gross domestic product would grow at a 1.7% annual rate in the first quarter, and 2.2% in the second. Now its economists are looking for GDP growth of 0.6% in the first quarter, followed by a 0.6% contraction in the second.

In the third quarter, they look for growth to resume, but, says Deutsche's global head of economic research Peter Hooper, "there is no question there will be an overall loss of consumption and investment activity that does not come back."

Like most of his peers, Mr. Hooper believes the U.S. will skirt a recession. That is by no means a given, though. The risk of a downturn is very real.

Even without taking into account the effects of full-scale spread of the virus in the U.S., it isn't difficult to imagine a scenario where as people avoid things such as travel and dining out to reduce risk, businesses cut back on employment, leading to an adverse feedback loop that further hurts spending. Nor is it hard to imagine that small and midsize businesses forced to temporarily halt operations will get pushed to failure.

There are two major ways the epidemic will affect the economy: through disruptions to the supply of goods from China and elsewhere, and through the measures adopted in the U.S. to curtail the virus's spread. There is plenty of uncertainty on both counts.

China's economy has taken a severe hit from the aggressive measures its leaders imposed to curtail the virus's spread. Data such as daily coal consumption and passenger traffic remain far below year-earlier levels and, while there has been some pickup in business as many provinces and municipalities have relaxed restrictions, the country is struggling to get back to work.

That has disrupted global supply chains, and the U.S. economy is getting hurt as a result.

The good news is that China's actions appear to have worked, or at least slowed the speed of the spread, laying the groundwork for an eventual recovery in activity. One key question: Will the lifting of quarantines and other restrictions lead to fresh outbreaks in China? That could make the resumption of Chinese manufacturing uneven.

Moreover, the spread of the virus to other countries making goods the U.S. depends upon, such as South Korea, is only making supply-chain problems worse. Shortages of key manufacturing components as well as finished goods could be a persistent problem for American businesses, sapping the strength of any recovery.

The other big way the virus will affect the economy is through how people respond to its threat. Already, people are canceling travel plans and avoiding gatherings. How bad the economic damage gets will ultimately depend on how far such social-distancing measures extend and what types of measures state and local governments might adopt to stem coronavirus's spread.

But it is hard to gauge the scope of such measures as epidemiologists are struggling to understand some basic facts about the virus, such as how fatal and transmissible it is. The underlying problem is that nobody knows how many people have actually been infected, says Caroline Buckee, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. "We don't know how many people have no symptoms at all, or who have minor symptoms."

But it could be awhile before that information is available. Meanwhile, Americans may only become increasingly cautious, placing spending at further risk.

And absent a vaccine -- something that, if it comes, realistically won't be available for quite some time -- signs that the epidemic are starting to be contained probably won't lead to people, businesses and authorities to abruptly lower their guards. Rather, they will continue to engage in many of the cautious behaviors that helped arrest the virus's spread. Scattered outbreaks may only reinforce that message.

So there will be no sudden booking of vacations and no immediate resumption of major business conventions.

No V, in other words. The coronavirus epidemic will weaken the economy, and that weakness will last an uncomfortably long time.

U.S. News: Immigrants' DNA Will Be Collected

WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration plans to begin taking DNA samples from migrants crossing the border or held in detention for use in a federal criminal database, a significant expansion of immigration laws that is certain to raise privacy concerns.

The new rule, posted by the Justice Department on Friday and set to take effect in April, will require immigration officers to collect cheek swabs from what could amount to hundreds of thousands of unauthorized immigrants taken into federal custody each year, including migrants at the border and people asking for asylum.

The move, which is sure to face court challenges, injects a new civil-rights issue into the debate about immigration policy. It will amount to a significant expansion of the government's DNA database, operated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, that primarily contains samples from people accused of committing serious crimes.

Collecting DNA samples from immigrants has long been one method floated to better track criminals who had once been in federal immigration custody but might not otherwise be known to law-enforcement officials.

In 2005, Congress passed a sweeping new law giving the government more authority to DNA-test and fingerprint criminals, an expansion of government power after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The law granted the Department of Homeland Security an exception so they didn't have to take these measures with immigrants in its custody. The Obama administration exercised that exemption, arguing such a collection effort would amount to an impossibly cumbersome task.

Officials with the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security told reporters on Thursday that the expansion brings the government in better compliance with that 2005 law. The Justice Department also has argued the administration feels compelled to move ahead with the plan because it could help the government better identify immigrants who might commit crimes in the future.

The move is part of the Trump administration's broader shift to consider most immigrants entering the country -- even those who come to legal ports of entry -- as criminals. It has made all unauthorized immigrants targets for deportation, a departure from the Obama administration's policy.

It also follows a recent escalation in its long-running battle against "sanctuary" cities and states that adopt policies blocking cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The government recently has sued several states over their sanctuary policies, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement has launched a multicity arrest operation targeting cities including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago that refuse to help identify unauthorized immigrants.

Crossing the border for the first time is considered a misdemeanor under federal law and remaining in the country is a civil, rather than criminal, infraction.

The government's plan, which it made known in a proposed rule in October, alarmed immigrant- and civil-rights advocates, who said collecting DNA samples from people who haven't committed crimes would amount to significant violations of privacy. Many immigrants enter the country at legal ports of entry to ask for asylum, for example.

"The forcible collection and retention of DNA from hundreds of thousands of individuals each year would constitute a large and unjustifiable step toward full population surveillance," the American Civil Liberties Union wrote in a November public comment opposing the proposed rule. The Justice Department didn't alter its rule before finalizing it on Friday.

The Supreme Court has recognized a robust right to privacy in the U.S., even extending it to those living in the country unlawfully, though privacy laws have been relaxed within a hundred-mile radius of the border, where federal agents are permitted to perform warrantless searches and some unauthorized immigrants can be deported without a hearing.

REVIEW --- Word on the Street: When Unreliable Information Spreads Far and Wide

[Infodemic]

The World Health Organization has avoided labeling the spread of the new coronavirus a "pandemic" and it remains an "epidemic"" at least for now. In a media briefing on Feb. 24, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that the decision is based on assessing "the geographical spread of the virus, the severity of disease it causes and the impact it has on the whole of society."

Meanwhile, WHO has approved of another, more innovative "-demic" term: "infodemic."

In a report last month, the organization warned of "a massive 'infodemic,' an overabundance of information -- some accurate and some not -- that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it." That warning was seconded by the MIT Technology Review, which observed that the virus has the makings of "the first true social-media 'infodemic,'" as "social media has zipped information and misinformation around the world at unprecedented speeds, fueling panic, racism . . . and hope."

"Infodemic," as a shorthand for "information epidemic," has been circulating since 2003, when it was coined by the political scientist David J. Rothkopf in an opinion piece for the Washington Post. Rothkopf was addressing the SARS epidemic, writing, "A few facts, mixed with fear, speculation and rumor, amplified and relayed swiftly worldwide by modern information technologies, have affected national and international economies, politics and even security in ways that are utterly disproportionate with the root realities."

While "infodemic" may be a novel portmanteau term, its building blocks are much older. "Information" started getting clipped down to the snappier "info" as early as 1904, when a purveyor of horse-racing tips divulged in the San Francisco Examiner, "Here's where I got the 'info' straight from the barn door." As a combining form, "info-" took off with the rapid rise of information technology in the 1970s ("infosphere," "infostructure," "infomania," "infographic") and the 1980s ("infomercial," "infotainment," "infoholic").

The element "-demic," shared by "epidemic" and "pandemic," goes back to the ancient Greek root "demos," meaning "people." "Epidemic" literally means "prevalent among a people," and started getting used for contagious diseases affecting whole populations in the early 17th century. "Pandemic" followed, using the Greek prefix "pan-" meaning "all," for an epidemic that strikes a wider geographic area, spreading over multiple countries or continents.

When Mr. Rothkopf blended "info-" and "-demic" to create "infodemic" in 2003, he recounted to me in a recent email, he was "struck by the fact that there were strong similarities between the way a disease spread through a population and the way an idea would 'go viral' on the Net." In the case of SARS, he said, "the infodemic impacted more people than the underlying epidemic that triggered it."

The word "infodemic" had its own viral success after its initial coinage. Just two years later, in 2005, "infodemic" was included in the New Oxford American Dictionary, where it was defined as "a surfeit of information about a problem that is viewed as being a detriment to its solution." Since then, the term has re-emerged regularly regarding global health scares: in 2006 for the avian flu, 2009 for the swine flu and 2014 for the Ebola virus.

Mr. Rothkopf told me that he was surprised at how quickly "infodemic" caught on, but that he appreciates that the term has led to a greater awareness of how the spread of information -- and misinformation -- can carry its own risks. Understanding it is essential to managing public health crises, he said, "and, in fact, any kind of situation in which viral spread of information can become a factor that may be bigger than that which triggers it." With social media whipping up a global panic surrounding the coronavirus, we just might be facing the biggest infodemic of all.

China's Early Missteps Fed Epidemic --- As doctors raised alarms, officials dragged their feet to take action against the coronavirus

WUHAN -- It was on Dec. 10 that Wei Guixian, a seafood merchant in this city's Hua'nan market, first started to feel sick. Thinking she was getting a cold, she walked to a small local clinic to get some treatment and then went back to work.

Eight days later, the 57-year-old was barely conscious in a hospital bed, one of the first suspected cases in a coronavirus epidemic that has paralyzed China and gripped the global economy. The virus has spread around the world and sickened more than 101,000.

For almost three weeks, doctors struggled to connect the dots between Ms. Wei and other early cases, many of them Hua'nan vendors. Patient after patient reported similar symptoms, but many, like her, visited small, poorly resourced clinics and hospitals. Some patients balked at paying for chest scans; others, including Ms. Wei, refused to be transferred to bigger facilities that were better-equipped to identify infectious diseases.

When doctors did finally establish the Hua'nan link in late December, they quarantined Ms. Wei and others like her and raised the alarm to their superiors. But they were prevented by authorities from alerting their peers or the public.

One of the first doctors to alert Chinese authorities was criticized for "spreading rumors" after sharing with a former medical-school classmate a test result showing a patient had a coronavirus. Another doctor had to write a self-criticism letter saying his warnings "had a negative impact."

Even after Chinese President Xi Jinping personally ordered officials to control the outbreak on Jan. 7, authorities kept denying it could spread between humans -- something doctors had known was happening since late December -- and went ahead with a Chinese Lunar New Year banquet involving tens of thousands of families in Wuhan.

China has rejected criticism of its epidemic response, saying it bought time for the rest of the world. Mr. Xi told 170,000 officials in a teleconference on Feb. 23 that the country's leadership acted swiftly and cohesively since the beginning.

A Wall Street Journal reconstruction paints a different picture, revealing how a series of early missteps, dating back to the first patients, were compounded by political leaders who dragged their feet to inform the public of the risks and to take decisive measures.

Last week, Zhong Nanshan, one of China's most highly regarded epidemiology experts and the leader of the National Health Commission's task force on the epidemic, said officials had identified a coronavirus by Dec. 31 and took too long to publicly confirm human-to-human transmission. If action had been taken earlier, in December or even early January, "the number of sick would have been greatly reduced," he said.

Although doctors worked hard to identify the disease quickly, they were hobbled by a health-care system that, despite huge improvements in the past 15 years, often leaves working-class people like Ms. Wei with insufficient access to general doctors and with crippling hospital bills.

When doctors did learn enough to sound the alarm, their efforts were stymied as the crisis became enmeshed in politics, both at the local and national level.

It now appears that, based on a speech by Mr. Xi published in a Communist Party magazine in February, he was leading the epidemic response when Wuhan went ahead with New Year celebrations despite the risk of wider infections. He was also leading the response when authorities let some five million people leave Wuhan without screening, and when they waited until Jan. 20 to announce the virus was spreading between humans.

As a result, the virus spread much more widely than it might have by the time Beijing locked down Wuhan and three other cities on Jan. 23, in the biggest quarantine in history. Those and other later measures appear to have slowed the spread within China's borders, but the global consequences of the early missteps have been severe.

"A lot fewer people would have died" in China had the government acted sooner, said Ms. Wei, in an interview on Feb. 16. She is now fully recovered and home in the apartment she has barely left for almost two months. Her daughter, infected in mid-January, was still in a field hospital, she said.

China's government information office, its National Health Commission and local authorities in Wuhan and the surrounding province of Hubei didn't respond to requests for comment.

Precisely how and when the epidemic began remains a mystery, as does the identity of the first person infected -- Patient Zero. The dominant theory is that the virus originated in a bat and jumped to humans via other live, or dead, wild animals, probably sold in the Hua'nan market.

What is clear is that by the second week of December, several Hua'nan workers were falling sick with similar symptoms, including fever, coughing, fatigue and aching limbs. Even at that initial stage, there were indications that it was spreading to people with no market exposure -- a signal of human-to-human transmission.

Wuhan's government announced last month that the first confirmed case was a person surnamed Chen who fell sick on Dec. 8 but had fully recovered and been discharged from the hospital. The person denied going to the Hua'nan market, it said.

Wu Wenjuan, a doctor at Wuhan's Jinyintan Hospital, which specializes in infectious diseases and handled many of the early cases, confirmed in a phone interview that among the earliest cases were four people in the same family, including a 49-year-old Hua'nan market vendor and his father-in-law. The vendor got sick on Dec. 12, while the father-in-law, who had no exposure to the market, fell ill seven days later, according to a study by Chinese disease control researchers.

Ms. Wei, the market vendor who fell sick on Dec. 10, first sought help at a clinic across the street from her home.

For two consecutive days, she went there to take antibiotics through an intravenous drip, a treatment popular among Hua'nan workers because it was cheap and relatively quick. "It's pretty effective for ordinary colds," she said. "There's always a line inside."

By Dec. 12, however, her condition didn't improve. She rushed to the midsize Wuhan Red Cross Hospital, also near the market.

There, she recalls, a middle-aged doctor informed her that her symptoms were compatible with bronchitis. She was sent home with medicine and told not to worry. After that, she went back to the clinic for more antibiotics. None had any effect.

She took a turn for the worse. On Dec. 16, unable to work and barely able to speak, she showed up at the emergency room of Xiehe Hospital but was sent home. She got a bed in a respiratory ward there only two days later.

She recalls seeing her daughters in tears before she lost consciousness. One "would touch me every so often, afraid I would pass away," she said.

When Ms. Wei came around three days later, she was barely able to move, but remembers one doctor surnamed Kong telling her, around Dec. 21, that two other workers from Hua'nan market were at Tongji Hospital, another major one in Wuhan.

"He said your illness is really serious," she recalled.

By Dec. 21, there were about three dozen people showing similar symptoms who would later be identified as confirmed or suspected coronavirus cases, according to a study released on Feb. 18 from China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC.

At the time, though, doctors had yet to establish the common link between them.

Zhang Jinnong, the head of Xiehe Hospital's emergency department, said he remembers the first Hua'nan patients coming in between Dec. 10 and 16.

He said he was relatively unconcerned at first, because there were no signs of the virus spreading between people. "Back then, I wasn't afraid at all -- I was even relaxed," Dr. Zhang said in a phone interview. "The early stages made us drop our guard."

Another local hospital, Wuhan Central, received its first coronavirus case, a 65-year-old man with a fever but no other symptoms, on Dec. 16, although doctors didn't know it then, said Ai Fen, who runs the emergency department there, in an interview on Feb. 18.

A CT scan revealed infection in both his lungs, but antibiotics and anti-flu drugs wouldn't shift it. Only after he was transferred to another hospital did staff there learn that he worked at Hua'nan, Dr. Ai said.

It would be another 11 days before doctors started to make the connection between the Hua'nan cases.

On Dec. 27, Dr. Ai received a second patient with similar symptoms, and ordered a laboratory test. By the following day, she had seen seven cases of unexplained pneumonia, four affiliated with the Hua'nan market, including a vendor's mother.

This could be a contagious disease, she remembers thinking to herself.

She informed the hospital's leadership on Dec. 29, and it notified the China CDC's district office, which said it had heard similar reports from elsewhere in Wuhan, according to Dr. Ai.

A doctor at the Hubei Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine had also raised the alarm on Dec. 27, state media would report later.

On Dec. 30, Dr. Ai got the results for the laboratory test. It said "SARS coronavirus," the same kind of virus that had killed 774 people world-wide after emerging in China in 2002.

Terrified, she immediately told her superiors. She also circled the result with a pink marker pen and sent a photo to a medical-school classmate, together with a video clip of lung scans from another patient.

That became the first evidence leaked to the public after they were passed to another doctor at Wuhan Central, Li Wenliang, whose death from the virus in February would trigger an outpouring of grief and anger at Chinese authorities.

In a group posting on the WeChat messaging app that afternoon, Dr. Li told more than 100 of his medical-school classmates "7 SARS cases confirmed at Hua'nan Seafood Market" and said the patients were "quarantined in the Emergency Department of our hospital."

By that night, the information was circulating widely on social media.

Hospital officials called Dr. Li to reprimand him. In a self-criticism letter confirmed by the Journal, he wrote that the leak "had a negative impact" on the National Health Commission's efforts.

Meanwhile, evidence of human-to-human transmission was mounting.

Lu Xiaohong, a doctor at Fifth Hospital in Wuhan, became alarmed on Dec. 25 when she heard that medical staff at two hospitals had been quarantined after being infected with an unidentified form of viral pneumonia, she told the China Youth Daily newspaper.

Early in the morning on Jan. 1, another patient arrived at Dr. Ai's department from the Red Cross Hospital, where Ms. Wei was briefly treated nearly three weeks earlier. The owner of a private clinic near the market had become seriously sick after treating several patients suffering from fever.

Fearing her colleagues could be infected the same way, Dr. Ai again alerted hospital authorities on Jan. 1, and ordered her department to put on masks.

That night, the hospital's discipline department summoned her for a chat the next day. She was criticized for "spreading rumors," according to Dr. Ai.

The hospital's leadership also banned staff from discussing the disease in public or via texts or images, Dr. Ai said. Eight days later, a nurse in her department became ill and was later confirmed to be infected by the coronavirus. By early March, three doctors at the hospital had died from the infection.

After warnings from local hospitals, the Wuhan office of the China CDC did a retrospective search for similar pneumonia cases with links to the Hua'nan market. It found several more, and reported those results on Dec. 30 to the national CDC headquarters, which sent a team of nine experts to Wuhan the next day.

The World Health Organization said its China office was informed on Dec. 31. Wuhan health authorities also issued the first official public statement on the outbreak that day, announcing 27 cases of suspected viral pneumonia related to the Hua'nan market.

"The investigation so far has not found any obvious human-to-human transmission or infection of medical staff," the statement from the Wuhan branch of the National Health Commission said. "The disease is preventable and controllable."

Medical authorities in Wuhan, meanwhile, were trying to get as many as possible of the suspected cases transferred to Jinyintan, the hospital that specializes in infectious diseases, where staff had built dedicated quarantine areas, fearing the virus could spread.

Some health experts say medical authorities made an error at that point by looking only for patients who had fever, direct Hua'nan market exposure and chest scans ruling out regular bacterial pneumonia.

In doing so, they overlooked those who had come in close contact with such cases, and other patients who had no direct exposure to the market, milder symptoms or illnesses other than pneumonia, the health experts said.

Back at Xiehe Hospital, Ms. Wei, the seafood vendor, had to undergo a new series of tests, including a throat swab and an endoscopy up her nose and down her airways. Like many other early cases, she couldn't be officially diagnosed with the virus because scientists had yet to genetically decode it and develop a test.

Her doctors treated her as a suspected case. They donned masks, isolated her and tried to move her to Jinyintan, but she refused, thinking they were trying to get rid of her because they suspected market workers were unhygienic. "I thought to myself, I sell clean things," she said. "I sell live shrimp."

One of seven early cases at Hubei Integrated also refused to be transferred. A doctor at Jinyintan got samples from the other six and sent them to the Wuhan Institute of Virology to try to identify the illness.

The institute would later reveal that it had identified a new coronavirus and mapped its genetic sequence by Jan. 2 -- critical steps toward containing the epidemic and designing a vaccine. But that wasn't made public at the time.

On Jan. 5, a medical research center in Shanghai notified the National Health Commission that one of its professors had also identified a SARS-like coronavirus and mapped the genome using a sample from Wuhan, according to an internal notice.

The virus was likely spreading via the respiratory tract, and "appropriate prevention and control measures in public places" were recommended, said the notice from the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. The center's director confirmed its authenticity.

Still, Chinese authorities didn't publicly confirm an outbreak of a new coronavirus until Jan. 9, two days after The Wall Street Journal revealed it, citing people familiar with the findings. They didn't share the genome with the rest of the world until Jan. 12.

While WHO and Chinese officials have repeatedly trumpeted the swift sharing of the genome data as evidence of transparency in Beijing's response, some epidemiologists believe it should have happened at least a week earlier.

They, and many local doctors, also fault the government's repeated denials of human-to-human transmission in the first half of January. "We knew then that the government was lying," said one local doctor. "But we don't know why they needed to lie. Maybe they thought it could be controlled."

Only after a WHO official told a press conference on Jan. 14 that there could be "limited human-to-human transmission, potentially among families," did the Wuhan branch of the National Health Commission echo that position.

Even then, Li Qun, the head of the China CDC's emergency center, played down the threat, telling Chinese state television on Jan. 15: "After careful screening and prudent judgment, we have reached the latest understanding that the risk of human-to-human transmission is low."

Hubei province and Wuhan, its capital, were holding annual sessions of their local legislative and advisory bodies between Jan. 6 and 17. Local authorities routinely try to suppress bad news in such periods.

Between Jan. 5 and 17, no new cases were announced. And on Jan. 18, Wuhan went ahead with a yearslong tradition of hosting a mass Chinese Lunar New Year banquet, where families pose for group photos and use chopsticks to share dishes.

The first public indication of Mr. Xi's involvement came on Jan. 20, when official media said he had ordered officials to contain the virus.

It now appears that he was in charge of the response since at least a Jan. 7 meeting of the party's top leadership, made public in February as anger mounted at a perceived lack of leadership from Beijing.

Chinese doctors and scientists said there were errors and delays by some experts sent by the government to Wuhan.

Among those sent in early and mid-January was Peking University's Wang Guangfa, who told official media on Jan. 10 that the virus had little capacity to cause illness and the epidemic was under control. Dr. Wang, who declined to comment, announced later that he had caught the virus.

Some of the experts had access to the first 41 confirmed cases at Jinyintan but were reluctant to share data with others before publication in a prestigious medical journal, according to some doctors and scientists involved in the response.

"Everyone was beginning to prepare for similar cases in other provinces and yet had no firsthand information on the virus and how it worked," said a doctor who repeatedly asked for more details and was brushed off. "Doctors across China were really angry about this."

Another doctor involved said Chinese authorities had been looking solely for evidence that the virus was spreading from patients to medical workers, overlooking signs that it was moving between patients, their relatives and others.

With international concern mounting and China's health authorities receiving reports of fresh cases in Wuhan and some other cities, Beijing sent a new team of experts to Wuhan on Jan. 18, the day of the Lunar New Year banquet.

That team included an infectious disease expert from Hong Kong who had reported the day before that human-to-human transmission occurred in a family from the city of Shenzhen who had visited relatives in Wuhan but had not been to the Hua'nan market.

It also included Dr. Zhong, as the leader of the task force, who had played a key role in combating SARS. Among the evidence local doctors presented to Dr. Zhong was that of a single patient who had infected 14 medical workers at Xiehe Hospital, according to that hospital's emergency chief.

Still, when President Xi made his first public statement on the crisis on Jan. 20, he made no explicit mention of human-to-human transmission, even as he told officials it was vital to contain the virus during the Lunar New Year travel period.

A few hours later, it was Dr. Zhong who announced on Chinese state television that the coronavirus was indeed spreading between people.

His team privately informed the Chinese leadership that the situation was more dire than they realized, and presented a series of recommendations, including locking down Wuhan, according to a city official familiar with the discussions.

As a WHO committee met in Geneva to discuss whether to declare a global emergency, President Xi imposed a cordon sanitaire on Jan. 23 on Wuhan and three other cities, affecting some 20 million people. By late February, new cases were slowing in China but rising sharply in other countries.

U.S. News: Global Outbreaks Are Likely to Increase --- Pandemic experts say the new coronavirus shouldn't have come as a surprise at all

The rapid and global spread of the deadly new coronavirus caught households, business leaders, investors and policy makers off guard, but health experts and economists who study pandemics say it shouldn't have come as a surprise at all.

Epidemics of infectious diseases have become a regular part of the global landscape in the past quarter-century, thanks in part to economic trends including urbanization, globalization and increased human consumption of animal proteins as society becomes more prosperous, these experts say.

The public needs to prepare for more of them, they add.

An old rule of thumb in pandemic research was that such events happened about three times every century, said David Finnoff, an economist at the University of Wyoming College of Business. So far this century, the world has already confronted an array of viral scares, including SARS in 2002 and 2003, the swine flu (also known as H1N1) in 2009, MERS in 2012, Ebola in 2014 to 2016, Zika in 2015 and Dengue fever in 2016.

The incidence of infectious disease events has more than doubled from the 1940s to 1960s, according to EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit research group that built a database tracking disease events globally. The rate of such incidents surged in the 1980s with the advent of HIV and is now rising, says Peter Daszak, the group's president.

"They're increasing exponentially," he said.

Already this century infectious disease pandemics -- not counting the common influenza -- have claimed more than 300,000 lives globally, according to Harvard researchers David Bloom and Daniel Cadarette.

Mr. Daszak estimates pandemics could cost as much as $23.5 trillion over the next 30 years. That estimate includes not just lost economic activity and property, but also the statistical value of lost human lives.

Urbanization means people are packing together more tightly, making them more prone to catching bugs from others. Ebola is one example. It isn't a new disease but became widespread and deadly when it spread to large cities in Liberia and Sierra Leone.

At the same time, globalization means people are venturing out farther across borders, giving bugs wider reach.

Moreover, animal-protein consumption is putting people in closer contact with livestock such as pigs and chickens, which can act as carriers of disease from other species. Between 2000 and 2019, global consumption of chicken grew to 97 million metric tons from 53 million, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. And as dense populations spread, Mr. Daszak says, people and their livestock are coming into closer direct contact with wildlife such as bats that are direct carriers of disease.

"Urbanization, agricultural intensification and deforestation are all part of the land-use change variable that was significantly correlated with emerging infectious diseases," Mr. Daszak said.

China, the epicenter of the latest outbreak, is also the epicenter of many of the economic trends giving unhealthy viruses a wider canvas on which to multiply. No country has urbanized more rapidly in the past quarter-century, according to World Bank estimates. In 2018, 59% of its population lived in urban areas, according to the World Bank, up from 36% in 2000 and 19% in 1980.

The U.S. has urbanized, too, though at a slower rate. Between 2000 and 2018 its urban population increased to 82% of total population from 79%.

During the same period, China became the center of globalization, as multinational companies built their manufacturing bases there. Between 2003 and 2018, air traffic between the U.S. and China increased to 8.5 million passengers from fewer than 700,000, according to the U.S. Transportation Department.

"Viruses don't need passports," said Michael Merson, a professor at Duke University's Global Health Institute.

Wuhan, the Chinese city where the new coronavirus and the illness it causes, Covid-19, first showed up, is an example of these trends. Between 2000 and 2018, its population grew from eight million to 11 million. In the process, developed land in the city more than tripled from about 210 square kilometers to 720 square kilometers, according to the Wuhan Statistics Bureau.

Wuhan opened a subway system in 2004 as a single line with 10 stations, the Communist Party-run People's Daily reported at the time. By December, it had grown to nine lines with 228 stations that handled 1.2 billion trips last year, according to state broadcaster Wuhan TV.

People have been flowing into the city in greater numbers, too, aided by more and speedier travel links. Wuhan hosted about 20 million tourists in 2000 and 288 million in 2018. In 2009, the city got high-speed rail service to Guangzhou, a prosperous megacity in southern China, as well as its third passenger railway station, according to the local Communist Party-run Changjiang Daily.

Travelers can reach 25 major cities from Wuhan on high-speed trains, cutting the time it takes to get to Beijing from 10 hours to five. Wuhan Tianhe International Airport replaced an older airport in 1995 and by the second half of 2018 had flights to 52 international destinations and 84 domestic ones, according to the provincial government of Hubei, of which Wuhan is the capital.

This development in the city coexists with trade in wildlife, a presumed vector of infection that Chinese authorities have promised to shut down across the country.

The rise of global pandemics creates a problem of collective action, says Ramanan Laxminarayan, a researcher at Princeton University. One of the best ways to combat the spread of a virus is for authorities to report their emergence rapidly to isolate bugs in early stages.

Individual countries, however, have an incentive to delay reporting until a problem is certain, because notifying others comes with economic costs, such as reduced travel and trade. In that context, reporting delays in China and Iran aren't a surprise, Mr. Laxminarayan said.

Mr. Finnoff said the U.S. needs to build a stronger health infrastructure to fight future pandemics.

"We have a huge military that is out there ready to be deployed to reduce the risk to this country from anything that occurs. Most of the time it is not being used, it is waiting," he said. The U.S. needs to start thinking about preparing for pandemics the same way, he said.

Mr. Daszak said he thinks the current crisis will prove to be manageable, noting that the mortality rate of Covid-19 isn't as great as SARS and the spread isn't rampant. "I'm not hiding in my bunker right now," he said. "We're going to get hit by a much bigger one sometime in the next 10 years."

Politics: Sanders's Plan Dramatically Alters Taxation

WASHINGTON -- Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is trying to expand federal taxation on a scale not seen since World War II, pursuing policies that would end the nation's run as one of the industrialized world's lowest-taxed countries.

Mr. Sanders's combination of taxes on wealth, income, financial transactions, corporate profits, payrolls, estates and capital gains would hit rich Americans from every direction. If Congress were to pass all of his plans, the total U.S. tax burden -- including federal, state and local taxes -- would resemble Canada's or Germany's rather than being near the bottom of the pack of rich nations.

Mr. Sanders views higher taxes as a means to pay for bigger health-care, housing, education and climate-change programs, and those plans would cost at least $40 trillion over a decade, according to the campaign, or a 66% increase in federal spending. And he seeks to stick companies and the top 1% of households with most of the bill.

"In developing our tax policies, our major goal is to make sure that we are reducing the massive level of income and wealth inequality that exists in America today," said Warren Gunnels, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders.

Independent analyses have cast doubt on whether Mr. Sanders's proposals add up, suggesting that the campaign overestimates how much money his taxes would raise and underestimates how much the new programs would cost. Mr. Sanders disputes that.

He also doesn't explicitly advocate more deficit spending, aiming to show that his tax increases, nontax revenue increases and some spending cuts will cover the costs of his new programs. His aides also point to his votes against tax cuts and wars as evidence of a Sanders style of fiscal hawkishness.

His proposed tax increases top $30 trillion over a decade, by the campaign's own reckoning. That is more than 10% of gross domestic product and at least a 60% increase in taxes over what would happen otherwise.

The last U.S. tax increase of this magnitude occurred from 1942 to 1944, during World War II, when the income tax was expanded to the middle class, raising federal revenue to 20.5% of gross domestic product from 9.9%.

"You made the income tax a mass tax, which was a big deal," said Mark Mazur, who was the top Treasury Department tax-policy official in the Obama administration. "This is like five of those."

Since World War II, U.S. federal revenue has stayed between 14.2% and 20% of GDP, and is slated to average 17.4% over the next decade.

Mr. Sanders's proposed tax increases would send that level past 28%.

"These are unprecedented tax increases. These are huge," said Nicole Kaeding, an economist at the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, a nonprofit research group affiliated with a conservative organization.

Almost all of Mr. Sanders's proposed tax increases -- except for middle-class taxes designed to replace insurance premiums and out-of-pocket health-care costs -- target the top of the income and wealth distribution, the millionaires and billionaires he castigates on the campaign trail.

The Progressive Policy Institute, a center-left group, estimates that his proposed spending would exceed revenue by $25 trillion over a decade, with much of the gap due to estimated costs of his Medicare for All program. Mr. Sanders's aides say their plans add up.

At some level, what separates Mr. Sanders from other Democrats on tax policy isn't necessarily direction but degree.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, who is Mr. Sanders's chief remaining rival, along with the party's leading tax-policy thinkers and its former presidential candidates, all want to raise taxes, concentrating on high-income households. They want to reverse parts of the 2017 tax law, let people shield less money from the estate tax, and close the tax-rate gap between investment income and wages.

"I favor higher taxes on high-income people," said Austan Goolsbee, an economist who worked for President Obama and supported former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg's campaign.

"I don't think Bernie or the other Democratic candidates are wrong that we are in a historical abnormality of tax giveaways to high-income people and big corporations," he said. "The question is: Is it conceivable to get $20 trillion of taxes just from high-income people?"

Report Faults Boeing, FAA Over Troubled Jet

Boeing Co.'s engineering mistakes and "culture of concealment," coupled with insufficient federal safety oversight, led to two fatal crashes of the plane maker's 737 MAX aircraft, House investigators said in a report released Friday.

The preliminary findings, issued by Democrats on the House Transportation Committee, describe in stark terms the engineering and regulatory lapses revealed in five public hearings over the past year into the design and certification of the MAX, which was grounded around the world last March following a second crash of the passenger jet.

The crashes of the Ethiopian Airlines flight and the Lion Air flight five months earlier, claimed a total of 346 lives. The protracted grounding continues as Boeing works on software fixes and develops pilot-training requirements that will win the approval of regulators. Boeing halted the aircraft's production in January.

Friday's report details Boeing's determination at various levels -- years before the MAX was approved by the Federal Aviation Administration -- to avoid putting pilots through costly ground-simulator training. That single-minded goal was evident across Boeing's engineering, marketing and management ranks, according to the report, and resulted in various efforts to mislead or withhold information from FAA officials during the lengthy certification process.

Both crashes occurred after pilots failed to counteract a new automated flight-control feature -- details of which they didn't know -- that misfired to repeatedly and aggressively push down the nose of their aircraft.

The 13-page congressional report offers new details about what it described as Boeing's improper conduct related to MAX, including fresh insight into the period during the plane's development and in the weeks after the first crash.

In July 2014, three years before the MAX started flying passengers and two years before the FAA made a decision regarding the extent of mandatory pilot training, the report says Boeing issued a press release seemingly predetermining the regulatory process. The company said pilots already flying earlier 737 models "will not require a simulator course to transition to the 737 MAX." According to the report, Boeing made the same pledge to airliner customers, including Ethiopian Airlines.

During the plane's development, Boeing successfully argued to remove references to the flight-control system, known as MCAS, from official manuals. As the House committee revealed earlier, the company also went to great lengths to keep FAA officials from scrutinizing and potentially recognizing the hazards of the system, even referring to it by another name.

The FAA's oversight effort was "grossly insufficient and . . . the FAA failed in its duty to identify key safety problems," according to the report.

The FAA said the agency welcomes the scrutiny and the lessons from the two crashes would bolster aviation safety.

A Boeing spokesman said, "We have cooperated extensively for the past year with the committee's investigation; we will review this preliminary report."

The report offered fresh insight into Boeing's actions after the first crash in Indonesia. The panel concluded that Boeing continued to minimize the importance of MCAS -- and persisted in deflecting the need for additional pilot training -- even in the wake of the Lion Air crash in October 2018 and stepped-up FAA assessments of the system's hazards.

Based on hundreds of thousands of pages of internal documents and other material Boeing turned over to the committee, the report spells out steps Boeing took to defend itself in the weeks after the Lion Air crash. At the time, the report indicates, Boeing maintained that design changes that had made MCAS more powerful complied with all safety rules and requirements.

Despite the Lion Air crash and the public outcry it created, Boeing sought to persuade the FAA to downgrade training requirements on MAX jets in general, according to House investigators. Their report says the effort by Boeing came in the face of regulators' warnings that the company's technical evaluation of the issue was at odds with the views of FAA experts.

The Democratic-controlled House committee intends to continue its probe, but Rep. Peter DeFazio, the Oregon Democrat who chairs the panel, surprised some industry officials and prompted blowback from Republican members by opting to release a preliminary report. Coming days before the anniversary of the Ethiopian Airlines MAX crash in March 2019, Democrats hope the material will provide momentum for significant legislative changes tightening FAA oversight.

Rep. DeFazio sought to avoid a partisan rupture during the committee hearings. But hours after the report came out, a pair of senior GOP panel members issued a rebuttal suggesting its conclusions were premature and potentially biased. The Republican statement said other reviews of the FAA's approval process for new aircraft designs haven't concluded the "system is broken or in need of wholesale dismantlement."

Separately, in Boeing's latest reported production lapse, the FAA on Friday proposed a $19.7 million penalty against the company for installing unapproved sensors on nearly 800 jetliners, including 173 of its 737 MAX models.

The alleged missteps, extending from mid-2015 to the spring of 2019, highlight Boeing failures to comply with its own quality-control rules covering aircraft production. The proposed civil penalty also reflects increased FAA scrutiny of Boeing's assembly-line safeguards.

A Boeing spokesman said the company has done a thorough internal review and implemented changes to address the FAA's concerns.

World News: Gunmen Kill 32 at Afghanistan Political Gathering

KABUL -- Gunmen opened fire on a political gathering in Kabul on Friday, killing at least 32 and wounding 58, against a backdrop of tensions between the Afghan government and the U.S. over the Trump administration's plan with the Taliban toward ending 18 years of war.

Politicians, including the country's main opposition leader, scrambled for cover as gunmen targeted an outdoor event commemorating the 1995 killing by the Taliban of a revered local figure.

Abdullah Abdullah, the country's former chief executive, escaped unharmed, officials said.

The Taliban denied responsibility for the attack. Hours later, Islamic State claimed responsibility and said two of its fighters carried out the assault.

Some people speculated that the attack might have been an effort by insurgent spoilers trying to undermine the fragile U.S.-led efforts to end the war in Afghanistan.

The special U.S. envoy to the region is working to pave the way for breakthrough talks between the Taliban and Afghan government, set to begin Tuesday. But there were few signs that the scheduled talks would begin as planned.

On Feb. 29 the Trump administration signed a landmark deal with the Taliban that charts a course for the U.S. to pull all of its forces out of Afghanistan by July 2021.

The Pentagon has already given orders for the U.S. military to begin withdrawing forces from Afghanistan, where about 13,000 service members currently help train the country's military and carry out limited operations against Taliban, al Qaeda and Islamic State fighters.

The U.S.-Taliban deal calls for release of up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners as a precursor to Tuesday's talks. But Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has rebuffed appeals from the U.S. to release any prisoners as a good-faith gesture before the talks begin.

Zalmay Khalilzad, the special U.S. envoy who negotiated the deal with the Taliban, returned to Kabul this week to try to work out a compromise.

Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah remain at odds over the recent presidential election, which ended with the Afghan president securing a second five-year term. Mr. Abdullah has challenged the results and is preparing to hold a rival inauguration on Monday, on the same day as Mr. Ghani.

Earlier this week, Mr. Ghani declined to meet with Mr. Khalilzad, according to Afghan officials, creating more friction between Washington and Kabul.

On Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged "all sides to stop posturing, start practical discussion about prisoner releases, knuckle down and prepare for the upcoming inter-Afghan negotiations."

Earlier this week, the U.S. military in Afghanistan accused the Taliban of squandering an opportunity by stepping up their attacks on Afghan forces after signing the deal with the U.S. in Doha, Qatar.

Friday's violence rattled the Afghan capital. It took more than six hours for Afghan security forces to kill the gunmen, who were holed up in a nearby building. It couldn't be learned how many fighters were involved, but Afghan security forces said they killed two militants.

Omid Maisam, a deputy spokesman for Mr. Abdullah who was in the front row when the shooting started, said he took cover with other people behind a wall as the insurgents used rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns to target the gathering.

"It was such a horrific and terrible day," he said. "I have lost many friends."

Virus Darkens Economic Outlook --- Monthly U.S. jobs data again show strength, but forecasters see threat of 'vicious cycle'

Financial markets and economic forecasters are warning of rising risks for the U.S. and global economy, which were improving before the novel coronavirus spread from China around the world.

A buoyant U.S. job market had fueled strong consumer spending and cushioned the economy through choppy waters created by the trade war with China, a manufacturing contraction and weakening momentum abroad. But markets flashed warning signals this past week showing investors see dangers ahead, particularly in the bond market, with Treasury yields tumbling to historic lows, and in commodities, with crude prices on Friday logging their worst day since the financial crisis.

The U.S. labor market remains a bulwark, with employers adding a robust headcount of 273,000 last month, the Labor Department said Friday. But that will be tested as the virus spreads and governments try to contain it. China and Japan, the world's second- and third-largest economies, are already flirting with recession from the coronavirus shock. The U.S. is the largest world economy.

"The good news is the U.S. has a lot of momentum heading into this," said Diane Swonk, chief economist at accounting and advisory firm Grant Thornton. She expects the economy to slow sharply in the first half of 2020 but avoid a recession. "The risk is this mutates into a more vicious cycle."

Ms. Swonk projects U.S. economic growth to cool to a 0.5% annual pace in the first half -- a marked slowdown from last year's 2.3% expansion, which itself marked an easing from a more robust 2018. She expects layoffs at restaurants, hotels and airlines, and for the unemployment rate to edge up from a half-century low.

The widening impact of the spreading virus, including into financial markets, caused Oxford Economics economists to cut their global economic growth forecast further to 2% in 2020. "The effects of financial market weakness and the disruption to daily life around the world will trigger lower consumer spending and investment on top of the disruptions to the global supply chain," said Ben May, Oxford's director of global macro research, in a note to clients.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said this past week its "best case" scenario would be for global economic growth to slow by a half-percentage point this year due to the epidemic.

The sectors where demand could suffer the most initially include air transportation, conference venues and hotels.

Southwest Airlines Co., which primarily flies domestic U.S. flights, said Thursday it has experienced "a significant decline in customer demand" and an increase in trip cancellations. United Airlines Holdings Inc., Germany's Deutsche Lufthansa AG and Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airway are encouraging employees to take unpaid leave at a time when airlines are reducing their flight schedules.

Restaurants, entertainment and retail -- industries that rely on discretionary spending and foot traffic -- also are at risk.

"Businesses that are primarily dine-in businesses may need to close temporarily if things get really bad," said Erik Herrmann, head of restaurant investment at CapitalSpring, which invests in and owns casual-dining restaurants. Mr. Herrmann expects drive-through services to benefit if the coronavirus spurs hesitancy among customers to eat inside restaurants.

United and Hyatt Hotels Corp. plan hiring freezes. General Motors Co. and Nestle SA are restricting employee travel. Events such as South by Southwest, a two-week tech, film and music festival in Austin, Texas, have been called off.

Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. have announced office closures in Seattle. While those high-tech workers can operate from home, Uber drivers and sandwich shops that served them could suffer.

"Workers can't all work from home, and you'll see lost output that can never be made up," Ms. Swonk said. "You can't attend a canceled sporting event later and you won't buy a sweater you wanted in March in late April."

One question for the U.S. is whether the impact spread to other business sectors. Manufacturers are reporting supply disruptions due to an extended shutdown of Chinese factories. Small businesses are concerned about whether they will have access to financing to bridge a slowdown in demand. And a temporary economic slowdown could put some heavily indebted firms at risk of default.

Before the market volatility, the U.S. economy was on a solid footing. In February, unemployment returned to a 50-year low and wages rose, the Labor Department said. Other recent readings showed layoffs at historic lows, steady consumer spending, low inflation and rising household income.

Then came the coronavirus. While the extent of economic harm isn't yet clear -- with damage contingent on how long it lasts, how widely it spreads and how people respond -- initial signs are already showing up.

Business activity by service providers contracted in February for the first time since October 2013, private data firm IHS Markit said Wednesday. Surveyed firms reported declining client demand and new business from abroad. The University of Michigan's gauge of consumer sentiment rose for all of February, but a fifth of respondents in the survey's closing days raised concerns about the coronavirus. The Institute for Supply Management said manufacturing activity cooled in February, as coronavirus effects rattled supply chains.

Products coming from China are facing backlogs, which weigh on U.S. sales. Keith McGee, owner of Black Sail Market LLC, said wait times for orders in China have recently grown to six weeks from two. Mr. McGee buys components from China and then assembles them into lights for the cannabis industry.

"I'm definitely starting to worry about it," he said. "I can't afford to be running out of inventory for a month. It basically means I have no revenue."

Crude prices notched the largest one-day decline since the recession on Friday after Saudi Arabia and Russia failed to agree on whether to reduce global supply in the face of the virus's effect on demand. Lower oil and gasoline prices could be a boon for U.S. consumers, though plunging prices could hurt parts of Texas and the Midwest where the local economies are increasingly tied to energy production.

Policy makers in the U.S. and abroad took steps this past week to blunt the impact, including an emergency half-percentage-point rate cut by the Federal Reserve and rate cuts in Canada and Australia.

The Fed has signaled it could cut rates further, but officials also have called for more government stimulus measures. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said Friday that a stronger fiscal-policy response is the "obvious alternative" to constrained monetary policy in the current low-rate environment.

President Trump signed an $8.3 billion emergency spending bill Friday to combat the virus, funding efforts to develop a vaccine and assisting local and state responses.

A much larger fiscal response may be needed, said Megan Greene, an economist at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. That could include reducing payroll taxes and providing more direct support to businesses and individuals, including steps such as loans and increased food-assistance payments.

EXCHANGE --- Visits to Epstein's Island Examined

U.K. investigators are examining visits by Barclays PLC Chief Executive Jes Staley to Jeffrey Epstein's private Caribbean island as part of a probe into whether Mr. Staley told the truth about his association with the convicted sex offender.

In a statement, a Barclays spokesman said Mr. Staley visited the island, Little St. James, twice, both times with his wife.

Neither the bank nor Mr. Staley had previously acknowledged the visits publicly.

Investigators are comparing disclosures Mr. Staley made to Barclays -- and which the bank subsequently made to U.K. financial regulators -- with a trove of emails and other documents handed over by Mr. Staley's former employer, JPMorgan Chase & Co., according to people familiar with the investigation.

Mr. Staley has said his relationship with Mr. Epstein was professional and began in 2000 when he was head of JPMorgan's private bank and the financier was a client.

He told journalists on Feb. 13 that his interactions with Mr. Epstein began to "taper off" after he left JPMorgan in 2013 and that the last time he had contact with him was in the "middle to fall" of 2015. He became Barclays CEO in December 2015.

"Mr. Staley visited Little St. James twice, accompanied by his wife on both visits," a Barclays spokesman told The Wall Street Journal. "The visits to Little St. James, and his meetings at the Manhattan address where Epstein maintained an office, were disclosed to the board."

The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority are examining "Mr. Staley's characterization to the company of his relationship with Mr. Epstein and the subsequent description of that relationship in the company's response to the FCA," Barclays said in a Feb. 13 statement.

At that time, the Barclays board said Mr. Staley had been "sufficiently transparent" about the nature and extent of his relationship with Mr. Epstein.

The FCA, the U.K.'s financial watchdog, determines whether executives are "fit and proper" to lead.

Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to prostitution counts in Florida.

This year, prosecutors in the U.S. Virgin Islands, of which Little St. James is part, alleged Mr. Epstein abused hundreds of young women and girls until 2018. The prosecutors said that for nearly two decades, Mr. Epstein brought girls as young as 11 to his secluded property on Little St. James.

Mr. Staley had a large sailboat custom-designed, which he and his family have regularly taken to the Caribbean. He once took the boat to Mr. Epstein's island, Bloomberg has reported.

JPMorgan provided the emails and other documents to the FCA and regulators in other countries who were probing Mr. Epstein, according to people familiar with the situation.

Mr. Epstein was found dead in a Manhattan jail in August last year. His death was ruled a suicide.

U.S. News: Trade Gap Narrowed in January

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. trade deficit narrowed in January as trade flows with the rest of the world slowed during a month when the coronavirus's impact became more pronounced in China.

The foreign-trade gap in goods and services contracted 6.7% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted $45.34 billion in January, the Commerce Department said Friday.

Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a trade deficit of $46 billion.

Imports decreased 1.6% in January. Exports, meanwhile, slid by 0.4% from December. The decrease in imports reflected fewer purchases of industrial supplies, capital equipment and autos. Meanwhile, U.S. firms shipped fewer aircraft and less oil.

January presented a complicated international trade picture. The Lunar New Year halted production in China, as is typical, but those shutdowns were extended as the country sought to contain the new coronavirus outbreak. Late in the month, signs emerged that the virus could effect other parts of the world. In late January, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first U.S. case of the Covid-19 disease caused by the virus.

"The bottom line is Covid-19 supply chain uncertainty could create demand uncertainty as well," Richard Hayne, chief executive of clothing company Urban Outfitters Inc., said Tuesday.

The outbreak may have negated effects from the U.S. and China signing a mid-January agreement that amounts to a cease-fire in their two-year trade war. The deal leaves some tariffs on Chinese goods in place.

Also, January saw a halt in U.S. production of Boeing Co.'s troubled 737 MAX jetliner.

In the trade report for January, the U.S. deficit with China narrowed to a seasonally adjusted $23.67 billion, largely because imports from China into the U.S. fell sharply.

U.S. News: Trump Campaign's Media Libel Lawsuits Are Long Shots

A series of libel lawsuits filed by the Trump campaign against large media organizations are likely to run up against tough obstacles and depending on how far they progress, could subject the president to depositions, according to legal experts.

The Trump campaign's defamation claims against the New York Times on Feb. 26, the Washington Post on Monday and CNN on Friday appear to be unprecedented, legal scholars said. Courts have heard defamation lawsuits from governors, an ex-president and a presidential candidate, but legal scholars said they couldn't recall the last time a sitting U.S. president or his campaign elevated grievances against the news media into civil legal action.

The Trump campaign's initial lawsuits concerned two Post opinion pieces published in June 2019 and one in the New York Times in March 2019. Each contain passages implying Donald Trump sought or welcomed Russia's intervention in the 2016 presidential election or the 2020 race.

The Trump team's libel complaints continued Friday with a new lawsuit against CNN, alleging the campaign was defamed by a lengthy opinion article posted in June on CNN.com. The complaint focuses on a passage stating that the Trump campaign had "assessed the potential risks and benefits of again seeking Russia's help in 2020 and has decided to leave that option on the table." The lawsuit called the passage "blatantly false." A representative for the network declined to comment Friday.

The lawsuits demand millions of dollars in damages.

President Trump is entitled to the protections of libel law, but his campaign organization could have disadvantages as a plaintiff, legal scholars say.

When it comes to defamation litigation, public figures such as Mr. Trump must establish that not only was a statement false and defamatory, but that it was published with "actual malice." That means showing evidence that the people who wrote and edited the statement knew it was false -- or likely false but they didn't care to print the truth.

Each of the lawsuits emphasize that special counsel Robert Mueller's report on allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election found insufficient evidence that Mr. Trump and his campaign criminally conspired or coordinated with Russia. Suggestions to the contrary are damaging to the campaign's reputation and require expenditures to clear the record, the suits state.

Legal scholars said there is a crucial distinction between statements asserting facts and ones expressing opinions. Opinions are usually treated as protected speech, while an incorrect, defamatory fact isn't.

The Trump campaign declined to comment. Fred Ryan, publisher and chief executive of the Post, said the suits are an affront to the principles of press freedom. A spokeswoman for the Times said the Trump campaign is using litigation to "try to punish an opinion writer for having an opinion they find unacceptable."

Where Do the Candidates Stand on This Radical Immigration Plan?

Politicians used to write bills pandering to American voters in election years. Now a bill in the House panders to deported criminals living in foreign countries. Chicago-area Rep. Jesus "Chuy" Garcia and 44 Democratic co-sponsors -- including three other lawmakers from gang-ravaged Chicago -- recently introduced a radical immigration bill called the New Way Forward Act that seeks, as per a press release from Mr. Garcia, to "disrupt the prison to deportation pipeline."

The bill would make it more difficult for U.S. authorities to deport illegal aliens who commit felonies. It would roll back the federal statute that requires local authorities to cooperate and communicate with Immigration and Customs and Enforcement, making sanctuary cities legal. Its provisions would also help return already deported felons to the U.S.

Not long ago such a proposal would have been dismissed as too radical in the faculty lounge at Berkeley; today it is fast approaching the mainstream in the increasingly woke Democratic Party. Consider the bill's key points:

-- It would create a five-year statute of limitations for deportations and formally decriminalize illegal border crossings.

-- It would raise the minimum prison sentence needed to require deportation from one year to five, paving the way for illegal aliens convicted of serious crimes such as armed robbery, sexual assault, child molestation and manslaughter to remain in America.

-- It would repeal a law that bars entry to aliens who have committed crimes of moral turpitude -- depravity such as murder, voluntary manslaughter, rape, child molestation, kidnapping, assault and so on. Even multiple offenders would be permitted to enter under the bill.

-- It concludes by bestowing a "right to come home" to the U.S. at taxpayer expense on anyone deported after April 24, 1996.

The media, lurching leftward with the Democratic Party, has largely failed to scrutinize the bill. But it's a mistake to dismiss this as a fringe proposal that will never see the light of day.

Recall the first Democratic debate, when NBC's Savannah Guthrie asked the candidates to raise their hands if their health-care plans covered undocumented immigrants. Every candidate on stage put his hand up, including Joe Biden, who hesitated and looked as if he knew it was madness but he had to keep up. The show of hands illustrated how bad ideas can go from fringe to mandatory in a few years.

We don't have a clear idea of how many Democrats support it, but many prominent representatives do. There are the usual suspects -- "the Squad," led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as well as several lawmakers from districts with serious crime problems. There are also a couple of surprising co-sponsors, such as Madeleine Dean (D., Pa.) and Andy Levin (D., Mich.), who represent moderate districts.

What about the presidential candidates? The campaigns of Mr. Biden and Bernie Sanders didn't respond to requests for comment. Mr. Biden has said he will have a moratorium on deportations in his first 100 days if elected. He has also asserted that criminal aliens with drunk-driving-related felonies shouldn't be deported but is vague on details.

Mr. Sanders wants to decriminalize illegal border crossings, stop construction of what he calls a "racist and ineffective wall," "break up" ICE and Customs and Border Protection, end workplace raids, and institute a moratorium on deportations. He also wants to "repeal 1996 immigration laws" intended to remove criminal aliens.

Why is the Democratic Party moving left on immigration when America elected a president who campaigned on building a wall? They might think they're courting the Latino vote, but many Latinos live in neighborhoods with crime problems. Mr. Garcia's heavily Latino district had 332 homicides in the past six years as of time of publication. The last thing people who live in violence-plagued neighborhoods need is a fresh infusion of deported criminals.

The media has a responsibility to pin the candidates down on issues like these, but too often reporters seem willing to save Democrats from themselves. If Democrats want to push for free return trips for deported criminals, let's make sure the American people know about it.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
The Senate and the Judiciary

Chuck Schumer says he regrets the words he used to threaten Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh last week, but perhaps we should thank him for the moment of candor. The Senate Minority Leader has reminded the country of the threat that a Democratic Senate poses to judicial independence.

Mr. Schumer's threats were cruder than most, but they are part of a larger Democratic-progressive project to politicize the judiciary and delegitimize the current Supreme Court. The effort has included opposing nearly all of Donald Trump's judicial nominees, threatening Justices with punishment if they issue certain rulings, stigmatizing judges who belong to the Federalist Society, and even threatening to change the structure of the High Court.

---

This goes well beyond the familiar criticism of Supreme Court rulings they don't like. And well beyond the popping off that President Trump has done about specific judges in specific cases. Mr. Trump is wrong to do so, but like so much of what he says it has had no legal effect. The judges ignore him, as they should, and so do Senate Republicans.

The GOP has reshaped the federal judiciary in the last three years the constitutional way. Mr. Trump has nominated competent judges, and the Senate has confirmed most of his choices. No one should be surprised since Mr. Trump promised to do this during the 2016 campaign, relying on the advice of conservative legal advisers.

Democrats are still angry that Mitch McConnell denied a Senate hearing to Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee to replace Antonin Scalia, in 2016. That was political hardball. But no less than Mr. Schumer tipped in 2007 that he would have done the same had George W. Bush had a Supreme Court opening to fill in his final year as President.

"We should not confirm any Bush nominee to the Supreme Court, except in extraordinary circumstances," Mr. Schumer declared in a July 2007 speech to the American Constitution Society. Mr. McConnell followed that Schumer precedent. He gambled the seat on the results of the 2016 election, when voters knew the future of the courts was on the ballot.

That future is again at stake, and Senate control arguably matters more to the judiciary than does the presidential race. Even if Mr. Trump is re-elected, a Senate Democratic majority would end the confirmation of judges who believe in constitutional originalism. Senate Democrats would refuse to confirm anyone associated with the Federalist Society or other conservative groups. And a Democratic President and Senate might not settle merely for nominating and confirming liberal judges.

The best indicator of Democratic intent is Sheldon Whitehouse, the Rhode Island Senator famous for excavating Brett Kavanaugh's high-school yearbook. In January 2019, Mr. Whitehouse wrote to Chief Justice John Roberts to protest that the Court accepted friend-of-the-court briefs from "special interest groups that fail to disclose their donors." He said if the Court didn't cease and desist, "a legislative solution may be in order." That's a political threat.

Mr. Whitehouse repeated the charge last month in an amicus brief with three other Senators in a case challenging the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The brief includes an appendix list of "a small and powerful cabal of self-interested entities" that dare to file amicus briefs disagreeing with Mr. Whitehouse on legal and policy issues.

Meanwhile, the Committee on Codes of Conduct of the U.S. Judicial Conference issued a draft opinion in January that would bar judges from belonging to the Federalist Society but not to the American Bar Association. A member of that committee is John McConnell, a federal district judge in Rhode Island who was promoted for the bench by none other than Sheldon Whitehouse.

In August last year, Mr. Whitehouse and four other Senators -- three on the Judiciary Committee as he is -- escalated the political intimidation. "The Supreme Court is not well," they wrote in an amicus brief on a gun-regulation case. "Perhaps the Court can heal itself before the public demands it be 'restructured in order to reduce the influence of politics.'"

---

What does "restructured" mean? It could mean packing the Court by creating seats for more than nine Justices. Democrats would have to kill the Senate's legislative filibuster so they could pass legislation without 60 votes. But that is what Senate Democrats did in 2013 to the filibuster rule for judicial nominees. They did so in order to pack the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals with a liberal majority to protect Mr. Obama's aggressive use of regulation.

Why would anyone think Senate Democrats wouldn't do it again if they had the power? Elizabeth Warren promised during her presidential campaign to kill the legislative filibuster, and the party's left might insist on it. One reason Mr. Schumer went off the deep end last week is that he knows he may face a primary challenge in 2022 from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Would he stand in the way of the Senate left on a filibuster change?

The Democratic goal here isn't merely to rebalance the courts with more liberal nominees the democratic way. The goal is to intimidate the judiciary into ruling the way Democrats want -- or else.

Woody Allen's Life Story: Canceled

By Roger Kimball

The Hachette Book Group announced last Monday that it would bring out "Apropos of Nothing," a memoir by Woody Allen, in early April. CEO Michael Pietsch told an interviewer that the publisher "believes strongly that there's a large audience that wants to hear the story of Woody Allen's life as told by Woody Allen himself."

There was also a noisy audience that didn't -- and that didn't want anyone else to hear it either. Last Thursday Hachette employees staged a walkout to protest the book, and on Friday Hachette dropped it.

"The decision to cancel Mr. Allen's book was a difficult one," said a spokesman for the publisher. "At HBG we take our relationships with authors very seriously, and do not cancel books lightly. We have published and will continue to publish many challenging books."

My own interest in Woody Allen is approximately zero. I used to find him funny, but the prospect of wading through "a comprehensive account of his life," as Hachette put it, fills me with gloom. Hachette had nonetheless determined that many readers would be interested in Mr. Allen's life story. They simply forgot to check with the feminist commissars to see if he passes muster in the age of #MeToo.

He doesn't, owing to an accusation that is more than a quarter-century old. In 1992, amid an ugly and public romantic split with actress Mia Farrow, he was accused of inappropriately touching their adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, then 7. Connecticut State Police referred the case to the Yale New Haven Hospital Child Sexual Abuse Clinic, which concluded that "Dylan was not sexually abused by Mr. Allen."

The facts are somewhat murky. The state attorney declined to pursue the case, despite announcing that he had "probable cause" to do so. A judge denied Mr. Allen's claim for custody, cast doubt on the Yale report, and wrote that "we will probably never know what happened," but Mr. Allen's behavior was "grossly inappropriate."

Dylan, now 34, has periodically revived the charge against her adoptive father, whose biological son, Ronan Farrow, has led the charge. Mr. Farrow has also been a leading #MeToo journalist, whose recent book, "Catch and Kill," was published by another imprint at Hachette.

"Your policy of editorial independence among your imprints," Mr. Farrow wrote in an email to Mr. Pietsch last week, "does not relieve you of your moral and professional obligations as the publisher of 'Catch and Kill,' and as the leader of a company being asked to assist in efforts by abusive men to whitewash their crimes."

But there are no crimes, not even charges against Mr. Allen, only allegations. As the world saw during Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, the principle of "innocent until proven guilty" has been replaced with "innocent until accused."

As for Hachette, it is happy to publish "challenging" books, but only within the ever-encroaching boundaries of political correctness. Trespass on that orthodoxy and watch the capitulation begin. As Groucho Marx is supposed to have said: "These are my principles. If you don't like them -- well, I have others."

The turmoil in global markets ratcheted up, with the prospect of an energy glut sparking steep selloffs in shares and oil, roiling currencies and fueling a stampede for the safety of government bonds.

Investors were responding to Saudi Arabia's decision to cut most of its oil prices and boost output, despite existing threats to demand from the coronavirus epidemic. The move escalates a clash with Russia.

"The fear today is about a global recession," said Thomas Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital, a hedge-fund-management firm based in New York. He said lower oil prices made it more likely some companies would default on their debts.

Trading in futures tied to the S&P 500 fell by the maximum 5% allowed in a single session, meaning trading was limited for the first time since shortly after President Trump won the U.S. presidential election in 2016.

U.S. government bonds, which have already rallied to record levels, extended gains. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note briefly fell below 0.5% and later stood at 0.516%.

In the Asia-Pacific region, the S&P/ASX 200 index in Australia dropped more than 5%. Japan's Nikkei 225 declined more than 6%, while benchmarks in Hong Kong and Shanghai dropped more than 3% and 2%, respectively.

The WSJ Dollar Index, a measure of the currency against 16 others, was down 0.4%.

Broken Hook Is Key to PG&E Case

A 3-inch hook purchased for 56 cents around the end of World War I could help determine whether PG&E Corp. faces criminal charges for starting the deadliest wildfire in California history.

Known as a "C-hook," the badly worn piece of metal broke on Nov. 8, 2018, dropping a high-voltage electric line that sparked the Camp Fire, destroying the town of Paradise and killing 85 people.

PG&E has hundreds of thousands of hooks, manufactured by a number of companies, holding up power lines in its 70,000 square-mile-territory, but the utility doesn't have good data on how old they are, and is trying to replace many of them.

Whether PG&E was negligent in inspecting and replacing these hooks has emerged as a factor in a continuing California investigation that could determine whether the company and some of its former executives face criminal charges for their role in wildfires.

"They're excellent hooks if you don't leave them up in towers for 100 years," said Mike Ramsey, the district attorney of California's Butte County who is leading the investigation along with the state attorney general's office.

Mr. Ramsey's office sent pieces of the broken hook to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's laboratory in Quantico, Va., for forensic examination. He expects to make a decision soon on whether to charge PG&E, individuals at the company, or both.

The issue also has caught the attention of a federal judge overseeing PG&E's criminal probation from a safety-related violation stemming from a 2010 natural-gas explosion. The judge is demanding that the company produce more information on what it knows about the hooks and when it learned it.

U.S. District Judge William Alsup has asked PG&E dozens of questions about its hooks and inspection practices, and expressed concern that the company still wasn't doing enough to catch problems.

"You always fall back on: 'We do inspections, we do inspections.' But the inspections aren't working," he told the company in court.

A PG&E lawyer told Judge Alsup that since the Camp Fire, the company has replaced thousands of hooks, some of which had significant wear. The company said an untold number of worn hooks remain in use.

PG&E said its inspections have uncovered the need to replace thousands of hooks and other hardware showing wear or corrosion and that all of the highest-priority problems have been addressed.

The hooks, about the width of a fist, hang from the steel towers that support transmission lines, helping to hold the charged wires.

Windy conditions, over decades, can cause the hooks to rub against their hangers, which can erode the metal and increase the odds of failure. State investigators said they believed about 75% to 80% of the hook that caused the Camp Fire had worn away before it broke.

PG&E has a poor record of maintaining its transmission lines and steel towers, a Wall Street Journal investigation last year found.

PG&E internal documents show that it knew for years that many of its transmission towers had reached the end of their useful lives, the Journal reported last year.

In a 2017 internal presentation, the utility estimated that its transmission towers were an average of 68 years old. Their mean life expectancy was 65 years. The oldest steel towers were 108 years old.

Plagued by shoddy records and aging equipment, the company struggled to respond this past decade as drought and climate change made a tinderbox of its service territory and exposed the dangers of its power grid.

Its equipment sparked 18 deadly wildfires in 2017 and 2018, killing more than 100 people, state investigators say.

The company has agreed to a settlement with state regulators probing the cause of the Camp Fire after they found systemic problems with its inspection and maintenance practices.

The hook that failed in November 2018 was manufactured by Ohio Brass Co., a company that originally made metal harnesses for horse-drawn buggies before developing hardware for some of the first transmission lines ever built, according to court filings, historical documents and Mr. Ramsey.

A spokesman for Hubbell Inc., which purchased Ohio Brass in 1978, said the company was "unable to identify the manufacturer of the hook in question."

Photographs of hooks removed from the tower on the transmission line where the fire started show Ohio Brass markings.

Ohio Brass catalogs from that period reviewed by the Journal don't describe any warranties, and there is no evidence that metal hooks manufactured around 1918 were expected to last a century.

"I can tell you positively they had no idea" how long they would last, said Doru Stefanescu, a professor emeritus of materials science at Ohio State University who is an expert in the kind of malleable iron used to make the hooks. Even today, he said, "we don't have data to tell you what happens over 100 years."

Court papers filed by attorneys representing fire victims suing PG&E for damages describe the hooks as "all worn, rusted, and degraded." PG&E inspectors, two months after the fire, noted in an inspection that a hook on the tower where the fire started "is rusty and corrosion is set on."

The line that sparked the Camp Fire, the Caribou-Palermo, is part of a transmission network known as the Caribou-Valona system, built around 1921 to carry hydroelectric power from the Sierra Nevada mountains to the Bay Area. Hundreds of its original steel towers are still in use.

PG&E has said in recent court filings it didn't track when its hooks were installed or how long they had been exposed to weather. It also didn't routinely inspect them to look for corrosion or wear. Before the Camp Fire, PG&E inspection forms didn't even include space to note the condition of hooks and other hardware.

There were reasons to be concerned about the condition of these hooks, records show.

In 1924, Ohio Brass stopped selling the type of malleable iron hooks that design documents indicate were used on the Caribou-Palermo just a few years earlier. Ohio Brass, switched to a new manufacturing method that produced iron "freed from all tendency toward embrittlement when hot-dip galvanized," according to an article in the March 1926 edition of the Journal of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.

In 1987, PG&E engineers noticed worn hooks on the southern portion of the 1921 transmission system. They requested tests on two hooks, which were supposed to hold up to 30,000 pounds. Both failed at 11,500 pounds. They then tested a third hook that didn't have any signs of wear. It failed at 6,900 pounds. One of the hooks was made by Ohio Brass while another was made by a different company, Lindsey Manufacturing Co., according to PG&E records.

The report concluded that PG&E should test more hooks to determine whether they were still dependable. In December, PG&E said in court filings it couldn't find any records related to further testing.

PG&E didn't routinely climb its transmission towers before the Camp Fire, instead inspecting them by ground or by air every five years. Since the Camp Fire, PG&E has rushed to inspect its entire electrical grid in search of other potentially dangerous problems. Inspectors last year spotted more than 5,000 high-priority safety hazards that hadn't been previously discovered.

Judge Alsup recently questioned PG&E's new inspection procedures after an expert hired by victims' attorneys testified that he spotted a worn hook on the Cresta-Rio Oso transmission line, which was built parallel to the Caribou-Palermo around 1928. The hook was a couple of hundred feet from the tower where the Camp Fire started.

Scott Hylton, a former Sacramento utility lineman, testified that after he first spotted the hook in the weeks following the fire, he assumed PG&E workers would replace it during inspections. When it was still there a year later, "I felt an obligation to bring it forward to make sure it wasn't missed," he said.

PG&E inspectors had examined this tower twice last year, once by climbing it and once by drone. In court filings, the company said inspectors failed to spot the hook damage based on the photos they took. After looking again, they determined the hook was about 30% worn. PG&E's guidelines require it to replace hooks with 30% to 50% wear within a year -- or within six months if they are in fire-prone areas.

"If I had C-hooks that were 30% worn out, I'd replace them," Mr. Hylton said in court.

World News: Kremlin Scrutinized In Flight MH17 Trial

A Dutch court on Monday opens the trial of four men accused of helping move into Ukraine a Russian missile that shot down a passenger jet, killing all 298 on board and sparking international outrage.

Also on trial, unofficially, is the Kremlin.

The West blamed the 2014 shootdown of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 on Russia, which was pouring men and military equipment into eastern Ukraine in support of antigovernment forces, as part of its effort to keep Ukraine under Moscow's influence.

President Vladimir Putin has denied Russian military involvement in the six-year conflict or the downing of the plane. But the trial will make public evidence to the contrary -- including telephone intercepts and witnesses -- that could complicate renewed efforts to end the war. French President Emmanuel Macron has launched a new attempt to engage Mr. Putin, which has drawn criticism from some European officials who say it is premature.

Russia has criticized the investigation as incomplete and biased, blamed Ukraine for the shootdown, and provided a variety of unsubstantiated theories about what happened.

Petro Poroshenko, who was Ukrainian president when the plane was shot down near the eastern city of Donetsk, said the results of the lengthy investigation should expose the true nature of the Kremlin's military interventions in Ukraine and elsewhere.

"What will Putin do now? What about his claims that 'there are no [Russian soldiers] there'?" Mr. Poroshenko said in an interview. "It will be clear that he has been lying for six years."

The downing of the plane, which was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on July 17, 2014, drew international condemnation of Russia and added momentum to sanctions against Moscow. The Netherlands, the country with the largest number of victims, took charge of the criminal investigation, supported by investigators from Australia, Belgium, Ukraine and Malaysia.

Prosecutors filed charges against four suspects, including three with ties to the Russian military and security services. They aren't expected to appear at the trial, as they are in Russia or in the part of Ukraine not controlled by Kyiv.

The suspects include Igor Girkin, a former colonel in Russia's Federal Security Service who was defense minister for the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, or DNR, at the time. He denies rebels shot down the plane.

Prosecutors say the suspects facilitated the transport of the missile, which they say came from Russia's 53rd Antiaircraft Missile Brigade. They have appealed for more witnesses and hope to charge other suspects, including the crew handling the missile and those who ordered them into Ukraine.

Investigators have made public parts of their investigation, including what they say are intercepted calls between Russian government officials and the leadership of the DNR in which they discuss administration, financing and military support from Russia. "We now have the information, have the proof, that the Russian Federation is involved in this tragedy, in this crime, one way or another," lead prosecutor Fred Westerbeke said in June.

U.S. News: Big Tech Seeks Facial-Recognition Laws --- Companies push for nationwide rules as cities and states look at bans, severe curbs

WASHINGTON -- Amid rising calls for regulation, technology companies are pushing for laws that would restrict use of facial-recognition systems -- and head off the more severe prohibitions some cities and states are weighing.

Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and others stand to profit as government agencies and businesses expand use of the technology, which can require large investments in machine-learning and cloud-computing capacity.

That opportunity is threatened by campaigns to severely restrict its use.

San Francisco and six other cities have passed laws to block government use of facial recognition. Lawmakers in New York, Massachusetts, Hawaii and Michigan are considering some form of ban or strict limitation.

Pressed by advocacy groups, concert promoters Live Nation Entertainment Inc. and AEG Presents, which stages the Coachella Arts and Music Festival, say they don't have plans to use facial recognition at their events.

More than 60 college campuses have also disavowed the technology, activists say -- including the University of California, Los Angeles, which confirmed it nixed a proposal to link its security cameras to facial-recognition systems.

A coalition of 40 activist groups led by Fight for the Future is circulating "Ban Facial Recognition" petitions that call on lawmakers to block government agencies from any use of the technology. Erica Darragh of Students for Sensible Drug Policy, part of the coalition, says recruiting volunteers is a snap: "Facial recognition freaks people out."

If elected president, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says, he would bar police from using it.

Against this backdrop, Microsoft is backing bills in Congress and in its home state of Washington permitting use of the technology with oversight.

"If we don't move past the polarizing debates that have blocked progress, people will continue to be left without any protection under the law," Microsoft President Brad Smith said.

The Washington state measures would allow facial recognition for specific uses such as investigating crime, controlling access to a building or identifying a ticket holder.

Amazon, the world's largest provider of cloud-computing services, declined to comment, but has said it supports national standards. International Business Machines Corp. has called for "precision regulations" that don't allow mass surveillance, and the CEO of Google owner Alphabet Inc. has said he is open to a temporary pause while regulations are developed.

Privacy advocates view industry-supported regulations as ploys to conduct business as usual.

"They are effectively geared to allow these companies to continue selling and profiting from these technologies, more or less unhindered," said Meredith Whittaker of New York University's AI Now Institute.

The market for technologies involving some form of facial recognition could be worth $14.5 billion in 2025, up from $2 billion last year, according to research firm Omdia.

Supporters see facial recognition as a means to keep intruders out of buildings, speed up entry lines at stadiums and airline gates, identify criminal suspects and locate missing children.

Opponents fear it will usher in a surveillance state. Participants in street rallies or public protests would lose their anonymity. Retailers could identify people entering their stores, possibly using it to monitor people with shoplifting convictions.

In the wrong hands, the technology could be used to target victims for financial scams, extortion or other schemes.

Studies also show that some facial-recognition systems are less accurate on nonwhite and female faces than on white males, although accuracy has been improving as the technology advances.

So far, law-enforcement agencies are among the biggest early adopters. One supplier, N.Y.-based Clearview AI Inc., says it has 2,000 active users at law-enforcement agencies, largely in the U.S. and Canada, including individuals who have been given a free trial.

New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal says Clearview's facial-recognition app helped officers identify suspected sexual predators in an online sting operation led by Somerset County.

Amid rising concerns however, Mr. Grewal in January imposed a statewide moratorium on Clearview's system until guidelines can be drafted. Even so, an outright ban would be "an overcorrection that could potentially undermine public safety," he said in an interview.

Privacy advocates have raised concerns that Clearview hasn't submitted its algorithm for federal accuracy testing, as other companies have, and that the free trials it gives to police agencies don't go through the usual vetting for government contracts.

Critics also worry about Clearview's methods. It scrapes internet photo databases, including social-media posts. Other systems run narrower searches, like scanning mug shots.

That broader dragnet raises the risk of abuse, critics say -- enabling anyone with the Clearview app to take a photo of a stranger and potentially learn his or her identity and personal details.

Clearview CEO Hoan Ton-That says his firm compiles photos that are already public, and the technology is extremely accurate. Clearview limits use to law-enforcement and security professionals, he said in an interview, though he acknowledged potential investors have been given access.

For police, Clearview is "only a lead, not a piece of evidence," and they still need to prove their cases in court, he said.

In Congress, members of both parties are discussing limits on federal use of the technology, including a pause on new uses, but haven't reached consensus.

"This technology is coming. What we should seek is a means by which to make sure that Big Brother is not coming" along with it, said Rep. Clay Higgins (R., La.) at a Jan. 15 hearing of the House Oversight and Reform Committee.

One bill from Sens. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.) and Brian Schatz (D., Hawaii) would allow companies to use facial recognition with public notice, consent, and third-party testing. It has Microsoft's backing, but hasn't gained momentum.

Bills Advance in

Washington State

In Washington state, a bill from Democratic state Sen. Joe Nguyen aims to bar police from using facial recognition for broad surveillance.

Authorities could deploy it to identify suspects or track people suspected of felonies, but only after taking steps such as consulting the public and allowing third-party auditing.

"Technology itself is not what I'm scared of. I'm scared of how it's used," said Mr. Nguyen, who also is a senior program manager at Microsoft Corp.

A second Washington state bill on consumer-data privacy requires companies to post notice when they use facial recognition in public. The operator of a facial-recognition system would have to get permission before storing someone's likeness except when there is a "reasonable suspicion" the person was involved in a crime.

As the bills moved through the state Senate last month, Microsoft backed both. The Washington Association of Sheriffs & Police Chiefs opposed Mr. Nguyen's bill, calling it overly burdensome. The American Civil Liberties Union criticized both bills for legitimizing surveillance, saying the state should let municipalities make their own choices.

The state House passed different versions of the bills and lawmakers are negotiating.

Short-Term Loan Sector Worries Banks

Banks and other firms are growing cautious operating in short-term markets, a sign of the financial stress brought on by the coronavirus epidemic.

Short-term lending markets are the plumbing of the financial system, moving large volumes of cash from those who have it to those who need it. Confidence in their ability to function smoothly is integral to the performance of the wider financial system. Hiccups can lead to increased volatility and strain.

One area of recent note is the market in which firms borrow and lend cash through agreements to repurchase Treasury securities. Rates in the repo market are measured against the Federal Reserve's short-term benchmark. Last week the difference between the two, or the spread, widened to levels not seen since November.

The repo market is where firms such as hedge funds borrow to finance their investments and money-market funds earn returns on piles of cash. It also supports bank operations that include extending near-term loans to corporate clients.

At the same time, a measure of the premium investors will pay for dollars -- known as the cross-currency basis -- increased for the first time in years. Traders and salespeople at Barclays PLC, UBS Group AG and Morgan Stanley said such a move usually reflects a shortage of dollars available, a circumstance that was last acute when a sovereign-debt crisis gripped Europe in 2011.

"Dollar funding is always the orphaned child of crises as the regions where the pressures flare up have no control over it," said Credit Suisse Group AG analyst Zoltan Pozsar. Investors often use dollars to fund foreign investments.

Additionally, traders at large asset-management firms said they are having more trouble trading a variety of financial instruments, from corporate bonds to derivatives. One said the difference between what buyers wanted to pay and what sellers were willing to receive for investment-grade bonds is widening, with banks less willing to take on risk.

Some are even beginning to "fade" trades -- industry parlance for backpedaling from agreed-upon deals.

The pain is also being felt in the Treasury market, where high-frequency trading algorithms have pulled back as volatility increased. According to Priya Misra, head of rates strategy at TD Securities, liquidity in the Treasury market is bifurcated and stressed because of this phenomenon.

"When volatility picks up, the high-frequency traders step away," said Ms. Misra. "It's not a deep market."

Investors and bankers are concerned enough that they are studying options the Fed could take to ease jumpy markets that go beyond rate cuts. Many traders believe such cuts are an inadequate tool to fix a problem rooted in short-term supply-chain shocks that could leave companies short of cash to make payments on debt and other obligations.

"During the financial crisis, the Fed didn't employ the same cookie-cutter responses that central banks in the 1980s used," said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed-income at BlackRock Inc. "The market will react to innovative ideas that are targeted at stabilizing the near-term problem."

Mr. Rieder said the Fed could purchase longer-dated assets as it did in some post-financial-crisis operations, or buy municipal bonds, mortgages and other unconventional assets.

"I don't think they need to execute that sort of option today, but overall the Fed has tremendous leeway to operate in," he said.

Such possibilities aren't just idle trader talk. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said Friday that to provide stimulus, the Fed may need the power to buy a broader array of bonds beyond Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities.

Operational risks posed by the coronavirus are an additional source of worry. Banks and investment firms could be forced to close central trading hubs and scatter employees to remote locations, some of which hadn't been tested for some time until last week.

If financial institutions begin implementing contingency plans that make trading more difficult because traders are working remotely or from multiple backup locations, "the possibility for some kind of operational slowdown or malfunction gets high," said Nellie Liang, a former senior Fed economist who is now at the Brookings Institution.

Some smaller broker-dealers are extending overnight repo trades into the future, as evidenced by an esoteric measure called the general collateral term structure. This is presumably to reduce risks associated with large dealers asking employees to work elsewhere, said Josh Younger, head of interest rate derivatives strategy at JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Banks spent the past week ratcheting up plans to prevent the coronavirus from rapidly spreading among employees. Morgan Stanley, UBS and JPMorgan are among banks splitting global markets workforces into groups working out of locations spanning from Stamford, Conn., to Edison, N.J., -- or remotely from home.

At Goldman Sachs Group Inc., a group of traders would remain in the firm's downtown Manhattan headquarters -- but scattered between empty desks to avoid contamination -- while others would move to remote locations, a person familiar with the matter said.

Business News: Boeing CEO Regrets Candor

Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told executives that he regretted voicing criticisms of the company's leadership and former CEO in a recent interview with the New York Times.

Mr. Calhoun, who started as CEO in January, is dealing with the fallout of his candid assessment of Boeing's problems, telling executives they have his support despite sometimes harsh comments published in the article.

"I am both embarrassed and regretful about the article," Mr. Calhoun wrote in a message addressed to Boeing senior leaders, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. "It suggests I broke my promise to former CEO Dennis Muilenburg, the executive team and our people that I would have their back when it counted most. I want to reassure you that my promise remains intact."

Mr. Calhoun, who served on Boeing's board for about a decade before being appointed CEO, had vowed to make a fresh start for the beleaguered company. He has said he planned to focus on rebuilding trust in the company and being more transparent.

Boeing has been in crisis since two of its 737 MAX planes crashed within a five-month period, killing 346 people. The MAX has been grounded world-wide since last March and Boeing had to shut down production of the plane this year. The crashes have drawn scrutiny of the plane maker's engineering culture and damaged the company's relationships with suppliers, customers and regulators.

In a preliminary report released Friday, House investigators said production pressures, faulty assumptions, and a "culture of concealment," combined with insufficient federal safety oversight, led to the two crashes.

Separately, in Boeing's latest reported production lapse, the Federal Aviation Administration on Friday proposed a $19.7 million penalty against the company for installing unapproved sensors on hundreds of planes, including some MAX jets. A Boeing spokesman said the company has done a thorough internal review and implemented changes to address the FAA's concerns.

Mr. Calhoun told the New York Times that the challenges he is facing are more than he'd anticipated, according to the March 5 article. "And it speaks to the weaknesses of our leadership," he said.

He said Mr. Muilenburg may have increased production of the 737 MAX too quickly at the expense of quality. Mr. Calhoun suggested that Mr. Muilenburg had been chasing a higher share price, according to the article.

"I'll never be able to judge what motivated Dennis, whether it was a stock price that was going to continue to go up and up, or whether it was just beating the other guy to the next rate increase," Mr. Calhoun said, adding that the board had trusted Mr. Muilenburg and his proven record of taking risks that had paid off.

Mr. Muilenburg couldn't be reached for comment.

Mr. Calhoun publicly expressed support for Mr. Muilenburg in the months leading up to his removal in December, but the board eventually became frustrated with Mr. Muilenburg's overly optimistic projections and convinced that he had mismanaged the company's relationship with the FAA, potentially complicating the plane's return to service, people familiar with the matter have said.

Mr. Calhoun had become more engaged in managing the company after being made chairman in October, when the board stripped Mr. Muilenburg of that role, but has sought to draw a clean break from the company's past missteps.

"I watched the same movie you did -- I think I was in the front-row seat, and I might come to exactly the same conclusions you do," Mr. Calhoun said in a call with reporters in January. "My leadership role here at Boeing is intended to make changes that correct a lot of those situations."

A Boeing spokesman said Mr. Calhoun wanted to provide Boeing executives with more context about what he had said in the interview.

"It is important to Dave that his teammates have a full understanding of his views and the context they were given in," a Boeing spokesman said. "And like many interviews, not everything makes it into the story, and Dave wanted to share some of the points he made about the good work of our team and the strength of our portfolio of products and services."

In the message on Friday, Mr. Calhoun said he had wanted to speak candidly about the company's challenges, but hadn't intended to undermine its current leadership team.

He said he was invested in Mr. Muilenburg's success, and that the disappointments he discussed in the interview mostly related to the company's failure to return the plane to service going into the fourth quarter.

"Now is not the time to look behind us. I regret doing it. Now is the time to look forward and build on our foundation," he wrote.

Mr. Calhoun said he maintained his commitment to being more transparent.

"I have said that transparency is a messy process but worth it in the end, and I still believe it."

How to Ease the Coronavirus Panic

The spread of the new coronavirus has already wreaked economic havoc. China's economy virtually came to a standstill in February. Elsewhere, tourist and business travel has collapsed, conferences and sporting events are being canceled, and supply chains for the production of goods have been hit. These demand and supply-side shocks -- and the expectation of more to come -- have led to panic in the financial markets. In the past two weeks, equity markets have fallen steeply and volatility has soared, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has collapsed to an all-time low, and liquidity in the market for U.S. government securities -- normally the world's most liquid market -- has dried up.

These knee-jerk reactions are understandable. After all, nobody can know the duration and course of this scourge, and markets hate uncertainty. But if one takes a longer view with clear eyes, the American economy is in good shape. The longest expansion in U.S. history is set to continue. Balance sheets are sound, and there is ample monetary support for continued growth. The broad money supply measured by Divisia M4 is growing at an annual rate of 6.9%, up from 4.2% a year earlier.

Asia is the epicenter of the Covid-19 outbreak. It's also the epicenter of the supply-chain problems. Supply chains are nothing more than payment chains in reverse. Typical supply chains consist of a supplier of raw materials, a maker of basic industrial goods, a manufacturer of semifinished or partly assembled items, and the maker and distributor of final products. At each stage there is a payment flowing in the other direction.

Key links in the physical supply chains are heavily concentrated in Asia. Trade finance -- the "financial supply chain" -- which underpins the production supply chains, is U.S. dollar-denominated and supplied by banks in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China and Hong Kong. But these Asian banks' access to dollar funding is limited. When dollar-funding stresses occur in Asian financial markets, they ricochet toward U.S. banks and finally to the Federal Reserve as the ultimate supplier of dollars or dealer of last resort.

These funding problems have already started to show up in the U.S. money markets. The term repo auction conducted by the New York Fed on March 5 was three times oversubscribed. Bids were $72.55 billion compared with the $20 billion offered. In other words, dealers are concerned that over the next two weeks they may need cash to meet demand from their correspondent banks in Asia or to ensure they can bid in the coming U.S. Treasury auctions.

How should the Fed respond? Last Tuesday the Federal Open Market Committee decided to cut the range for the fed-funds rate by 50 basis points. The world's major central bankers and commentators fetishize interest rates. They cheered the Fed's move because they believe that changes to interest rates are an indicator of the central bank's monetary-policy stance. In times of trouble, they think, lower fed-funds rates are countercyclical and therefore desirable. But now the central bankers think they are out of, or nearly out of, ammunition, since interest rates are near zero, or even negative. In an unexpected twist, central bankers have become the loudest proponents of fiscal stimuli.

The focus on interest rates originated with John Maynard Keynes and has been propagated by antimoney Keynesians ever since. Consider: During the Depression, the Fed's discount rate was 6% when the stock market crashed in October 1929. By April 1931, it had plunged to 1.5%. This signaled to many that monetary policy had been loosened. But interest rates weren't the only things plunging. So was the money supply, indicating that monetary policy was actually too tight. Interest rates as a gauge of the Fed's monetary-policy stance were -- and are -- no better than flying blind.

Monetary policy today has become detached from reality and the needs of markets. It is driven by misleading theories about what interest rates can achieve. Contrary to popular belief and the wisdom of crowds, monetary policy isn't about interest rates. It is about providing the right amount of funding -- the right quantity of money.

The right response to the current volatility is to follow Walter Bagehot's classic dictum: Supply ample funds at a penalty rate against decent collateral. In other words, the Fed needs to supply liquidity to deal with the panic -- whether by quantitative-easing purchases of long bonds, by Treasury bill purchases, by repos or, most important, by increasing the amounts of U.S. dollar swaps available to the central banks of Japan, China, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong.

If the Fed acts to remove the financial stresses in the market via liquidity injections, the panic will subside and a recession can be avoided. The injections can then easily be withdrawn so that they don't later generate inflation.

Though the coronavirus pandemic poses serious short-term problems, it need not exacerbate the financial panic or tip the global economy into a recession. But the right strategy is crucial. The Fed and other central banks must let go of their interest-rate fetish. They must do what central banks have traditionally done to tamp down and extinguish panics. Ample liquidity -- read: money -- must be supplied at penalty rates.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
The Fed's Market Emollients

A decade of relative market calm may have caused some folks to forget that financial panics happen, and that's one reason the Federal Reserve exists. Amid the coronavirus contagion and now an oil price shock, the Fed may need to break out its 2008 medical kit to supply liquidity to fainting financial markets.

Jolts in asset and commodity prices along with worries about corporate-debt defaults are spooking markets, to put it mildly. The New York Fed on Monday said it planned to increase its daily overnight repo lending operations to $150 billion from $100 billion and raise its two-week repos to $45 billion from $20 billion. This is helpful. An immediate liquidity injection will arguably do more to ease credit conditions than another interest-rate cut with the effective fed funds rate already at 1.09% and the 10-year Treasury yield below 0.6%.

But the Fed may have to do more, starting with extending foreign-exchange swap lines with other central banks. These reciprocal lines were established after the 2008 crisis to improve liquidity in global financial markets. They let foreign central banks tap U.S. dollars to provide liquidity to their own financial institutions in addition to local currencies.

The Fed currently has swap arrangements with the central banks of Canada, U.K., European Union, Switzerland and Japan. It could extend these swap lines to other countries with markets in tumult like Australia, South Korea, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Foreign central banks should also be encouraged to supply dollars to their banks if needed.

Since the financial crisis, banks have been required to hold enough high-quality assets that they can liquefy during periods of financial stress -- like now -- to meet funding obligations. But the Fed's preference for cash to Treasurys has encouraged cash hoarding. The Fed could encourage more repo market lending by communicating that it considers Treasurys on par with cash.

The Fed could also assure banks that the discount window is available to liquefy Treasurys on demand if they need cash. Many banks in good financial condition during the 2008 crisis were reluctant to borrow from the discount window because they worried investors and other institutions would perceive that as a sign the bank was in trouble.

The financial system is sturdier now, but this stigma is also why the Fed established term-funding auctions. Under the two-year program, the Fed auctioned 28- and 84-day loans to banks in sound condition. The auctions gave the Fed more flexibility than traditional open-market operations and reduced the stigma associated with borrowing from the discount window. Other crisis-era tools to increase liquidity could be revived if needed.

Some of our friends are also calling on the Fed to revive its bond purchases known as quantitative easing. That seems premature. Government debt and mortgage purchases after the crisis were intended to stimulate the equity markets by driving investors into riskier assets and pushing down long-term bond rates. But the operations have been hard to wind down and may have caused credit distortions. It's also hard to push the 30-year bond much lower than its close Monday of 1.02%.

Unlike in 2008, the U.S. economy was strong going into the coronavirus contagion and now an oil shock. Public-health measures are still the real cure. But the Fed can reassure financial markets and ease credit conditions by fulfilling its mission as a supplier of liquidity in jittery times.

World News: Two Soldiers Are Killed in Raid on ISIS

BEIRUT -- Two American soldiers were killed during a raid on an Islamic State hideout in the mountains of central Iraq, highlighting the continuing security partnership between Baghdad and Washington despite strained relations.

The U.S.-led coalition said the two service members were killed while advising and accompanying Iraqi security forces on the mission on Sunday.

Iraq's elite counterterrorism service said 25 militants had been killed in the raid in the Qarachogh mountains. Coalition aircraft carried out repeated strikes while Iraqi soldiers clashed with Islamic State from Sunday until dawn on Monday, the service said, adding that nine tunnels and an Islamic State training camp were also destroyed.

Islamic State lost the last of its territory last year following a multiyear campaign by Iraqi and Syrian forces backed by the U.S.-led coalition. The group's leader, Abu-Bakr al-Baghdadi, was killed in a raid in Syria by U.S. special-operations forces in October.

But the group remains active in Iraq's ungoverned rural areas, mountains and deserts where security forces are stretched thin. The mountains in central Iraq have long provided a haven for militants because of the rough terrain and the gap they create between Iraqi security forces and the Kurdish forces that control the north of the country.

U.S. and Iraqi military commanders have warned that growing disorder in Iraq and the region could undermine the gains made in the war against Islamic State.

The coalition of U.S. and allied foreign troops suspended operations in Iraq in January amid a surge of anti-American sentiment after the killing of a prominent Iranian general by the U.S. in Baghdad. In response, the Iraqi parliament voted in favor of expelling U.S. troops from the country, plunging relations with Washington into crisis.

Joint operations have since resumed, and the push to expel U.S. forces lost some momentum under threat of U.S. financial penalties along with wrangling over the formation of a new Iraqi government. The coronavirus outbreak is further drawing attention away from the issue.

Rout Tightens Squeeze on Europe's Banks

Monday's market convulsions heaped more pressure on Europe's limping lenders, as they scramble to help customers cope with the impact of the coronavirus.

Banks are extending special measures to customers whose businesses are stretched because of the spread of the virus amid unprecedented moves across almost every asset class in recent days. It is the latest challenge for lenders already struggling with negative interest rates and sluggish growth across the region.

The special measures -- such as deferring mortgage repayments, extending credit lines and offering bridging loans to those in need -- are now set against a backdrop of sharp falls in stock markets, surging demand for Treasurys, plunging oil prices and wild swings in currency markets.

Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, a U.K. lender of which the British government owns 62% after it provided a taxpayer-funded bailout in the last financial crisis, pledged GBP 5 billion ($6.5 billion) in working capital Monday for companies affected by the virus outbreak.

The uncertainty "is unprecedented even by recent standards," RBS Chief Executive Alison Rose said. "We are here to support and can help businesses manage any short term disruption."

The share prices of European banks have been battered as the virus spread across the continent. The Stoxx Europe 600 Banks index has plummeted 30% in the past three weeks. The banks' cost of funding has almost doubled in the past few weeks and is now at levels not seen since 2013, when Europe was dealing with a debt crisis, according to Tom Kinmonth, a fixed-income strategist at Dutch lender ABN AMRO Bank NV.

Investors worry that as economic activity falls, companies will struggle to fulfill their debt obligations, pay workers and keep their businesses alive. Banks sold off again Monday, part of the broader market rout.

A rise in defaults would immediately hit banks, which would have to assume losses at a time when many in the region are reporting low profits because of negative interest rates and anemic growth.

Eurozone government officials, banking authorities and other regulators have met over recent days to discuss ways to help small and midsize companies facing liquidity crunches, including through state guarantees, tax deferrals and incentives for banks to lend more, according to people familiar with the talks. European Union officials are also looking into state aid rules and how they might offer temporary exemptions to allow for greater government assistance.

Europe's main banking supervisor, an arm of the European Central Bank, has asked banks to present plans to continue operating in case the virus outbreak escalates. It is also paying close attention to how credit quality evolves, a person familiar with the situation said.

While banks wait for broad measures, some are trying to ease the pain for borrowers before it gets worse.

In Italy, which extended its quarantine measures to the whole country on Monday night, UniCredit SpA, the country's biggest bank, said it would provide a 12-month moratorium on mortgage repayments for retail clients and companies in some municipalities.

In Germany, where cases have been lower but companies are getting hit by the severe slowdown in China, a big trading partner, UniCredit's German unit said it is offering interim financing, bridging loans and extended payment periods to those affected.

Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government announced limited measures Monday to help companies deal with the epidemic, including boosting subsidies to keep employees on reduced hours instead of laying them off in times of crisis. Troubled companies will also be able to access cheap loans and guarantees from state-owned banks.

In the U.K., clients of Lloyds Banking Group PLC that have supply-chain problems can ask for working-capital support, a spokeswoman for the London bank said.

"Barclays is ready to help, whether that's with managing cash flow or any other support," Ian Rand, head of Barclays PLC's business banking unit, said.

Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde have both indicated that they are prepared to act.

"The Bank of England's role is to help U.K. businesses and households manage through an economic shock that could prove large but will ultimately be temporary," Mr. Carney said in a speech in London Thursday. "Our policy arsenal includes monetary policy instruments, special liquidity facilities, and macroprudential tools."

In Frankfurt, the ECB is ready "to take appropriate and targeted measures, as necessary and commensurate with the underlying risks," Ms. Lagarde said in a statement on the website of the eurozone's central bank.

Among the ECB's options is a further cut in interest rates, which are already below zero. The central bank is likely to announce its next policy steps at a news conference on Thursday.

U.S. News: Ex-CIA Staffer Guilty of Lesser Charges

A federal jury couldn't reach a verdict on whether a former software engineer for the Central Intelligence Agency was responsible for leaking a trove of classified documents to WikiLeaks, convicting him instead on lesser charges stemming from the leak.

Joshua Schulte, 31 years old, was convicted of making false statements and contempt of court -- charges that related to Mr. Schulte's conduct after the March 7, 2017, publication of the CIA materials, dubbed Vault 7 by WikiLeaks. The jury said Monday they were deadlocked on the remaining eight counts, including the illegal gathering and transmission of national defense information.

The hung jury, following a week of jury deliberations, marks a blow to the Justice Department in its crackdown on government leaks. One former top CIA official who testified called the leak "the equivalent of a digital Pearl Harbor."

The government could choose to prosecute Mr. Schulte again on the deadlocked charges.

A spokesman for the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, which brought the charges, declined to comment on the verdict. Lawyers for Mr. Schulte declined to comment.

During the four-week trial in Manhattan federal court, prosecutors presented witness testimony, internal CIA communications and computer records in an attempt to show that Mr. Schulte stole the top-secret materials and gave them to WikiLeaks in 2016. At the time, he was a disgruntled employee in the CIA unit that designed the agency's hacking tools.

In cross-examinations of government witnesses, Mr. Schulte's lawyers sowed doubt about the government's case, suggesting that the CIA had pinned the embarrassing leak on Mr. Schulte because he was a difficult employee who had antagonized his colleagues and superiors.

On Friday afternoon, the jury -- made up of just 11 jurors, after one was dismissed during deliberations last week for reading news coverage of the case -- sent a note to U.S. District Judge Paul A. Crotty saying they were "aligned on two counts" but at an "impasse on the remaining counts."

On Monday morning, Judge Crotty agreed to receive the verdict on two counts and declare a mistrial on the remaining counts.

In all, the jury deadlocked on eight counts: three counts related to the gathering and transmission of national defense information, two counts of unauthorized access to a computer to obtain information, one count of theft of government property, one count of transmission of a harmful computer program or code and one count of obstruction of justice. The judge dismissed an 11th count before the jury began deliberations last week.
