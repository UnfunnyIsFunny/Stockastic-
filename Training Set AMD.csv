Pennsylvania, the nation's fifth-most populous state, recorded the largest number of unemployment claims in the U.S., an outsize jump that suggests other states could report higher numbers ahead.

Jobless claims in the Keystone State rose to 378,908 last week, up from 15,439 the prior week, as the state's economy reels from layoffs because of the novel coronavirus.

The number of people filing for benefits represented nearly 5.8% of the state's labor force.

State officials said jobless claims were so high because they actively pushed workers to file for unemployment benefits and didn't see the kinds of disruptions in filing other states experienced. Workers in many parts of the country complained they were unable to access websites and get through on phone lines, meaning other states may be accepting a high volume of delayed filings in the coming weeks.

Also, workers still have plenty of time to file such claims, meaning numbers could rise everywhere as economic prospects dim because of the pandemic. Workers aren't required to file for claims the week they are laid off.

""I think Pennsylvania is indicative of what you're going to see elsewhere,"" said James Sweeney, chief economist at Credit Suisse. ""I think you're going to see claims pick up in a lot of other states in the coming weeks, and that's pretty sobering considering the level we just saw.""

Pennsylvania's numbers came out Thursday along with a record number of workers nationwide, nearly 3.3 million, filing for jobless benefits last week.

The state's experience suggests that the stresses facing the nation's unemployment system could grow in the months and weeks ahead, as other states catch up on processing claims and more workers pursue those benefits.

A spokeswoman with the Pennsylvania Labor Department and Industry said the state system didn't suffer major disruptions like those reported in states such as California and New York. The state also relaxed the requirement that the unemployed be actively seeking work to qualify for benefits.

Holly Chapman, 62, of Jefferson Hills, Pa., said she filed a claim online last Tuesday after being laid off from a catering company when a spate of weddings and other events were canceled.

""I think because I was Johnny on the spot, it was relatively painless for me,"" she said. She added that co-workers who waited a couple of days encountered delays, but were eventually able to complete their claims.

There is also still plenty of time for workers to file claims. Some applying last week may have been laid off before the pandemic hit, but sought benefits as job prospects dimmed.

Ohio had the second-highest number of claims with 187,784, narrowly ahead of California with 186,809. By contrast, in New York, which has nearly seven million more residents than Pennsylvania, 80,334 workers, or about 0.8% of the labor force, filed for jobless benefits.

REVIEW --- After the Pandemic: Nations Push Back Against a Globalized World --- Dangerous times remind governments that their first loyalty is to their own citizens.

There are no atheists in foxholes, it's said, and we are learning quickly that there are no free traders in a pandemic.

As the coronavirus spread its deadly tentacles across Europe earlier this month, the German government announced a ban on exports of surgical face masks. Shipments of the masks that were already on their way to neighboring countries were turned back at the border. The country that repeatedly lauds the borderless economy and castigates those narrow-minded nationalists who would build walls, restrict trade and favor their people over the interests of ""global citizens"" is now hoarding vital equipment to keep Germans alive at the expense of fellow Europeans. When it comes to the lives of its people, you might even say it's Germany First.

No one should be surprised at or critical of the Germans. Any government's primary responsibility is to protect its citizens. Despite the grandiose rhetoric of the most ambitious globalizers, it seems that nations still take primacy over supranational ideals and institutions. Never more so than in an emergency.

The coronavirus outbreak has sent the world into geopolitical as well as literal, home-based lockdown. International travel has collapsed, subject to tight restrictions as countries close borders. Trade is slumping as global supply chains are disrupted. Capital is coming home as investors seek safety. National governments almost everywhere are undertaking massive fiscal and monetary programs to breathe some life into moribund national economies.

Countries are seeking to do what they can to bolster their own standing in a moment of global panic. The U.S. points a finger at China as the origin of the virus. China promotes absurd conspiracy theories about the U.S. Rogue nations like Russia and Cuba try to polish their reputations with public relations stunts like sending aid to stricken Italy.

The larger question is what will happen when all of this is over? While trade, travel and international cooperation will surely come back from their crisis levels, it's not hard to see this outbreak as marking the most decisive break yet with our globalized system.

The backlash against globalization has been perhaps the defining political trend of the past decade. For all the benefits it clearly brought -- low-cost production and highly efficient capital markets -- the distribution of costs in an integrated global economy has been heavily skewed toward the less advantaged in developed economies such as the U.S. Add to that the cultural alienation felt by many of those people as their more fortunate and successful fellow citizens looked down on them, and you got the populist revolution of 2016.

After this crisis, global supply chains with limited inventory will be regarded with much more caution by CEOs and shareholders. Nations' need to maintain supplies of vital lifesaving equipment will accelerate the repatriation of significant production. Businesses will discover that all that expensive international travel that seemed so crucial can actually be replaced by videoconferencing and other technologies. Governments and peoples will view each other with a lasting mistrust as we learn more about the falsehoods we were told.

Above all, the renewed sense of fragility that we all feel today will surely strengthen the bonds of national community. We feel a special solidarity with each other as we watch our doctors and nurses bravely saving lives in New York and New Orleans, just as Germans will feel the same with theirs in Dresden and Dortmund.

The pandemic that has struck down the world economy is the most powerful reminder yet that the globalized world we have created in the last half-century is a construct -- as well as, to some extent, a creator -- of a world of peace and security. It may not survive a less stable world.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Fed Weighs Support for States --- Local governments are confronting skyrocketing borrowing costs

Federal Reserve officials are reviewing new ways to support financing for state and local governments, many of which are on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic and will face huge borrowing needs as revenues plunge, according to people familiar with the matter.

The economic-rescue legislation Congress approved this week asks the Fed to charge headlong into areas it has long considered taboo -- supporting lending to businesses, cities and states.

The Fed traditionally avoided intervening directly in credit and fiscal policy, preferring to leave such matters to Congress and the White House.

That is changing now because of the fast-moving economic crisis -- and because Congress has essentially directed the Fed to get more involved by providing $454 billion to the Treasury to cover any losses in new Fed lending programs.

The Fed has dramatically expanded its balance sheet over the past two weeks, by nearly $942 billion to $5.25 trillion as of Wednesday. The central bank has lent freely to help firms avoid a wave of defaults that could turn a recession into something much worse.

Over two weeks, the Fed has unveiled six lending facilities, five of them enjoying a total of $50 billion in support from the Treasury. Those programs have freed up cash for major Wall Street institutions and will backstop money-market funds and markets for commercial debt.

Democratic lawmakers have made support for city and state borrowing a priority in recent legislative talks, and the latest bill directs the Treasury secretary to seek a Fed lending program for municipal finance.

State and local governments are confronting skyrocketing borrowing costs even as they are straining to pay expenses associated with the spread of the virus. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Fed Chairman Jerome Powell last week ""to think big and help our states,"" she said in an interview on PBS this week. ""They are taking a big bite of this wormy apple and they need much more in terms of resources.""

Under its governing law, the Fed can't directly buy corporate debt, and it is limited to purchasing municipal debt of six months or less.

But it can work around these restrictions by creating lending facilities that lend or purchase debt, subject to approval of the Treasury secretary.

The Fed has already dipped a toe into muni-debt markets by expanding a money-market lending backstop to include certain types of municipal debt -- and by purchasing some highly rated municipal debt in a facility backing the market for very short-term commercial debt.

As of Wednesday, short-term interest costs on variable-rate municipal bonds have more than tripled compared with two weeks ago and are now higher than the rates governments typically pay on 30-year bonds, according to an index maintained by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.

Monday's announcement by the Fed to include more municipal debt in existing lending facilities appears to have made only a small dent, bringing the index, which tracks bonds that adjust their rates weekly according to what investors are willing to pay, to 4.7% down from 5.2% the prior Wednesday.

Interest rates on other short-term muni debt that spiked last week have fallen after the Fed said Monday it would purchase some municipal variable rate debt. Rates on water, power and sewer bonds issued by New York City and Los Angeles fell back to their typical rates of between 1% and 2% Thursday after hitting nearly 8% on Friday.

Kent Hiteshew, who established an office of state and local finance at the Treasury Department in the Obama administration, has been hired by the Fed to advise on muni markets, according to people familiar with the matter.

Among the questions Fed officials are considering: Whether to expand existing facilities to accommodate other municipal debt or to launch a new facility devoted to state and local finance. Fed officials will have to decide which municipal debt might be eligible for support and on what terms.

There are limits to how far the Fed can lend using its emergency authorities. Its loans must be well secured, which the Fed typically satisfies by restricting borrowing to highly rated issuers.

The Fed and Treasury brainstormed on ways to support hard-hit state and local treasuries after the 2008 financial crisis, but opted against doing so.

Five Lives. Five Countries. How Virus Swept the Globe. --- Confusion and dread as loved ones fought a relentless pandemic

Raju Sarker had been sick in his dormitory for two days, staying away from the Singapore construction site where he worked. He had a headache and chills. His stomach didn't feel right. He was exhausted.

But on a phone call with his wife on Feb. 5, the 39-year-old put on a brave face. She was back home in Bangladesh, two months from giving birth. Mr. Sarker, hoping for a baby girl, had been thinking about what his firstborn would call him: Baba, or perhaps Abba.

""Don't worry,"" he said, ending the conversation in under two minutes. He didn't tell his wife he had borrowed $250 from his employer that morning to go to the hospital, nor about his cough, persistent and draining. The next day, he ignored her calls altogether. He'd speak to her when he felt a little better, he thought, and texted: ""I'll call you later.""

At the hospital, doctors sent him straight to the intensive-care unit. A mysterious new virus had emerged in China and begun springing up in neighboring countries, including Singapore. Mr. Sarker didn't know much about it, except that since Lunar New Year in January, he and his team, which installed information-technology infrastructure in data centers and office towers, had been instructed to wear face masks on the job.

Governments were calling it the novel coronavirus. Over the next two months, it would spread widely, carried by the most-connected human population in history to all corners of the world.

In this era of globalization, families scattered across continents would watch from afar with confusion, dread and helpless foreboding as their loved ones fought a disease the world knew very little about.

It would upend five lives, all exposed to the virus as it traveled from country to country, week after week.

But before all that, on the afternoon of Feb. 8, Mr. Sarker's coronavirus test came back. It was positive.

Budapest

In Paris, dining on truffle ravioli and the first oysters of his life, Gabor Szabo and his Brazilian wife wondered if they should be worried about the sickness that had arrived in Europe. It was Feb. 16, their seventh anniversary, and they were a long way from home, Rio de Janeiro. The couple would soon fly to Hungary to spend time with Gabor's dad, a cancer patient.

Battling lymphoma at age 70, Albert Szabo was eager to get to know the daughter-in-law he had recently met for the first time. For years, the family had drifted apart. Gabor chased jobs from construction to running his own restaurant in South America, enjoying a global lifestyle once incomprehensible for his father, a Hungarian who grew up under Communist dictatorship.

Previously, the elder Mr. Szabo had been able to speak to his daughter-in-law only in short messages typed into Google translate, each Portuguese-Hungarian exchange full of humorous errors.

The family had spent two days at the home of Mr. Szabo, a retired truck driver, when Gabor developed a fever, sore throat and cough. He visited a hospital that sent him back to his father's house without testing for coronavirus. The ailment cleared up.

On Feb. 23, the elder Mr. Szabo noticed he had the same symptoms. ""There is nothing wrong, these are just side effects of chemotherapy,"" he told the couple.

Milan

With infections of the recently named Covid-19 disease surging in Italy, authorities had begun quarantining towns in the country's wealthy north. Ivo Cilesi thought he might still manage to make a quick road trip from his apartment outside Milan to Genoa, the seaside town of his youth.

A renowned therapist, he had pioneered a technique of treating dementia patients with imaginary train rides, earning the nickname Dr. Train. Nursing homes tended to inject these elderly full of sedatives. Instead, he helped them cope with music or dolls, aiming to bring dignity to the people society tended to shove aside.

He and his partner had already packed their bags for a long weekend, when on Feb. 26 he found himself strangely exhausted. ""Why go to the beach,"" he said, ""if we're just going to be stuck inside because I'm not feeling well."" They stayed home.

At breakfast on Friday, Mr. Cilesi suddenly panicked. ""I can hardly breathe, I can hardly breathe,"" he gasped.

""Relax, what's going on?"" his partner asked.

As she dialed Italy's 112 emergency number, a thought struck her: He wasn't protesting her call for an ambulance. He was shaking.

Tehran

The doctor said 10% of Aitai Shakibafar's lungs were damaged. She quickly became a suspect for the new disease that was spreading rapidly through her country, Iran. Twice, Ms. Shakibafar had coughed up blood in her hands, her nails still painted with the Minnie Mouse icon from the beauty salon where the 30-year-old wondered if she'd caught it.

A female photojournalist in a male-dominated industry, Ms. Shakibafar was often the only woman snapping pictures from the scene of a disaster. Rather than join her sister in Canada, she preferred to take her camera to far-flung corners of their home country reeling from floods and economic deprivation.

At dusk on March 5, Ms. Shakibafar lay down in the back seat of her car with her father behind the wheel, racing through the streets of Tehran. The hospital waiting-room was teeming with people. But medical staff saw she was having trouble breathing.

As she was being admitted to the intensive-care unit, she felt faint. Someone got her a wheelchair.

Washington, D.C.

The same day, Liza Paqueo, a specialist in urban forest programs at the U.S. Forest Service in Washington, D.C., was surprised to see missed FaceTime calls from her mother in the Philippine capital Manila, where it was well past midnight.

The two spoke every day, often more than once. Her mother sometimes called in the middle of the night to nudge Liza to play her turn on Words With Friends, an online Scrabble-like game the two competed fiercely on. Her mother had last made D-O-L-T for 36 points, followed by H-O-A-X by Liza. It was her mother's turn.

That day, though, the call was about something else. Her mother, Nida Cortes Paqueo, was in a hospital bed. An X-ray showed she had pneumonia in her right lung. Liza was shocked, but didn't think it could be the novel coronavirus. There were still only a limited number of cases in the Philippines, and U.S. figures were just starting to grow.

Besides, her mother took long walks, danced the rumba with friends she had known for half a century and, while she had a sore throat and fatigue for a few days, nothing seemed especially alarming. Mrs. Paqueo had enjoyed a steak dinner for her 67th birthday a few days earlier.

Now in the hospital, she was losing her appetite. Mrs. Paqueo asked family members to bring her fruit and a salty shrimp dish. But when they did, she would often not eat.

Liza scolded her mother, so on FaceTime, Mrs. Paqueo showed her she was eating bread and sausage.

""Good job,"" Liza said. ""Now don't ask for your usual Coke Zero. You need calories."" she added, making her mother laugh, then cough.

Milan

A doctor and an ambulance crew stormed through the door of Giovanna Lucchelli's apartment outside Milan. Her partner, the therapist colleagues called Dr. Train, was struggling to breathe.

Medics fitted an airway pressure-release ventilator onto his face. At the hospital, Ms. Lucchelli paced the corridor while her partner vanished into an X-ray room. A chest scan showed he had progressed to pneumonia. Doctors thought: coronavirus. They carried Mr. Cilesi, by now unconscious, into an isolation ward, closed off to all but a strained crew of physicians racing to handle the influx.

They would have to wait and see if his oxygen levels crept up.

Ms. Lucchelli returned home for the evening, expecting the hospital to call. Normally, when the two weren't together, Mr. Cilesi dialed many times daily, or called her sister if she didn't answer. ""Make sure your phone is always charged so I can reach you anytime,"" he would say.

The next morning, the doctor gave her the news. The test was positive for coronavirus. Mr. Cilesi was taken to a larger hospital, and given experimental-drug treatments and muscle relaxants to prevent chest damage. Tubed into a high-performance ventilator, he was rolled onto his belly to give his lungs room to expand.

Every time she dialed the hospital helpline for updates, the doctors were too busy, the staff stressed. She wondered where her partner had contracted coronavirus, maybe in one of the three hospitals where he worked, in between a life of research and medical conferences abroad.

Friends of Ms. Lucchelli told her not to worry. Mr. Cilesi was relatively young, full of energy and strong like his father. This is like the flu, well-wishers said, and he would recover. Only the very old and very sick don't, they said.

Budapest

At Albert Szabo's cancer-related checkups in Hungary, physicians chalked up his high temperature to lymphoma complications. But by March 5, he was exhausted and could eat nothing more than a few bites of a banana or tangerine. When he told a doctor he was struggling to breathe, confusion shot through the room.

""Why didn't you start with that?"" the doctor asked, scouring his medical history for an explanation.

Hospital staff fit Mr. Szabo with an oxygen mask while the doctor worked on a diagnosis. Maybe it was a postsurgery pulmonary embolism? he wondered.

Then Mr. Szabo's son Gabor mentioned the possibility of coronavirus. It hadn't been their first thought, but medics rushed into action, putting on face masks and scrambling to protect themselves. The elder Mr. Szabo was frightened and numb as medical staff carried him away, his face obscured by the oxygen mask. Normally, the tough old man would have said a few defiant words, his son thought.

Two days later, Gabor got a call from a brother elsewhere in Hungary: ""They were just saying on TV that our father is the fifth patient in Hungary with coronavirus.""

Singapore

That night, in an isolation room in Singapore, Mr. Sarker's blood pressure was dropping fast. Doctors summoned his local contact, Jakir Khan, a man Mr. Sarker had grown up with in Bangladesh. An image of Mr. Sarker's lungs showed cloudy white patches, which meant heavy damage. His kidneys weren't working either.

Mr. Khan made a video call to Mr. Sarker's wife in Bangladesh. He didn't share the details of her husband's dire condition, worried it could trigger complications in her pregnancy a few weeks from childbirth. But if these were his final moments, she should at least see him, Mr. Khan thought.

He pressed the phone against the glass wall of the isolation room. Mr. Sarker lay on his stomach, his face turned to one side, obscured by tubes. She strained to see. Mr. Khan panned the camera toward a cluster of doctors. ""Look, they're all working very hard. Just pray for him,"" he said to her.

No one had spelled it out, but Sanjida Akhter could tell her husband's life was in real danger. Her parents had been crying. An only son, Mr. Sarker sent money to support his wife and widowed mother. The last time he was home, in the summer of 2019, she cooked him his favorite foods: beef curry, taro stir fry.

In July, she learned she was pregnant, and when Mr. Sarker left for Singapore, they agreed he would return after the birth. She wondered now if her husband would live to see their child.

That night, unbeknown to her, her father grappled with a wrenching question: If Mr. Sarker died, would they want the body flown back home? He came to the conclusion that they would. For peace of mind.

Still, there were logistical matters to consider. The body needed to be washed before burial under Islamic customs, but that wouldn't be possible because of the infection, he was told. They would also need permission from Bangladesh authorities.

Manila

Mrs. Paqueo was a planner. She had picked out her burial plot in her hometown of Surigao in the Philippines years ago. It is on a hill overlooking open waters. She'd instructed her family and friends she wanted her funeral to be a party. Her favorite song ""What a Wonderful World"" by Louis Armstrong, would play, and tunes by Earth, Wind & Fire.

By March 8, the pneumonia had spread to her left lung. She and her husband, a 72-year-old economist who had worked for years at the World Bank, were tested for Covid-19. They saw each other briefly that day before being taken to separate rooms. The results would come in 48 hours.

Medics put a breathing mask over her face and fitted her with a feeding tube.

From the U.S., her daughter Liza inquired about the coronavirus test every few hours. A U.S. citizen, she has lived in the country since 1985, when her parents moved there for work. The disease was now spreading in America.

A specialist in infectious diseases gave a webinar at her office. Liza asked if Tamiflu, which was being given to her parents, would be effective against Covid-19. The expert said most likely not.

Tehran

In the intensive-care unit in Tehran, Ms. Shakibafar breathed through an oxygen mask, garbed in a purple hospital gown. There were nine beds in the room, which was filled with patients like her who were struggling to breathe. Ms. Shakibafar's Covid-19 test came back positive several days after she was admitted.

People were dying around her. Hospital staff rushed into the room several times, drawing a curtain and intubating a near-death patient. If their efforts failed, the body was wheeled out.

When she felt able, Ms. Shakibafar talked to some of her neighbors. She cajoled a bearded man who looked to be in his 50s to eat. The next morning, his bed was empty. At first the nurses said he'd been moved to a hospital ward, not wanting to upset her. When she asked again, they said he had died.

The nurses counseled her. ""More than drugs, hope can help you,"" one said. They also talked about their own worries on the medical front lines.

Ms. Shakibafar struggled with the sense of doom around her. She played an Iranian love song from the 1990s on her phone and sometimes sang along, mumbling into her oxygen mask.

After five days in the ICU that felt like a terrible nightmare, Ms. Shakibafar was sent to a ward and then discharged. She cried. ""I saw the sky with a different perspective,"" she said.

Milan

Mr. Cilesi, the 61-year-old Italian therapist, never regained consciousness after his collapse that late-February day when he was rushed to the emergency room in the middle of breakfast. On March 2, Ms. Lucchelli learned he had died overnight.

She sent a suit and a photo of Mr. Cilesi to the mortuary, but the risk of contracting the virus was too high for the morticians, who could only lay the clothes atop the body before they cremated it. At least dress him in a hat, she asked. ""Ivo loved hats.""

Washington, D.C.

Liza got an urgent text from Manila as she had a late lunch on March 10. On the phone with a relative, she learned her mother's heart had stopped. Doctors gave Mrs. Paqueo chest compressions for eight minutes and revived her.

Liza took an Uber to her brother's house to be with family. It was there that she got the call. Mrs. Paqueo's pupils were dilated. Their mother had passed away at 7:27 a.m. on March 11, the day the coronavirus was officially declared a pandemic.

Her coronavirus test came back positive a few hours later, as did her husband's. He is still fighting the disease. Mrs. Paqueo was cremated. Her burial plot lies empty.

Budapest

The medical team in Hungary didn't think Mr. Szabo would last even a week. The odds were bleak for the 70-year-old retired truck driver, still battling lymphoma from a coronavirus isolation ward.

But on March 11, a doctor woke him up, and told the old man that his family was with him. Mr. Szabo, on a ventilator, couldn't speak but blinked to signal he understood. There was surprising news: His lungs and circulation were both improving, though he still wasn't out of the woods.

The doctor called it a miracle. Gabor thinks his father may have been lucky. Being one of Hungary's first patients, doctors were able to give him their full attention.

Recovered from his own likely bout of coronavirus, Gabor plans on staying in Europe in the months to come, perhaps taking up work in Sweden to support his parents. After years in Brazil and a battle with a global pandemic, he thinks maybe now is the time to remain close to family.

""My father is showing again how tough he is,"" his son said. ""It's hard to take out my dad, he is like an old oak tree.""

Bangladesh

In Bangladesh, Sanjida felt desperate. Her baby was due in a few weeks and Mr. Sarker had been in intensive care for more than a month. She wanted to see her husband.

Since she couldn't travel to Singapore, doctors agreed to hold up a phone close to his face on a WhatsApp video call. Mr. Sarker's eyes were closed, sunken, but he could hear, doctors said.

The last time the two had spoken to each other, more than a month ago on Feb. 5, he had told her not to worry. She had the same message for him. She wanted to sound upbeat, and somehow pull him back from the jaws of death.

""You're having a son,"" she said. ""I went to the doctor and he said I'm due to give birth on April 1. Get better and come home soon.""

Mr. Sarker's latest Covid-19 test came back negative. But after seven weeks in the hospital, he still can't breathe on his own, and his condition remains critical. Every day, Sanjida worries she's one step closer to her child's birth and perhaps her husband's death.

Her hospital bag for the delivery is packed.

The Weekend Interview with Frank M. Snowden: How Epidemics Change Civilizations

By Jason Willick

To put the coronavirus pandemic in perspective, consider what happened when the bubonic plague struck London in 1665. The onset of the disease could be sudden, says Yale historian Frank Snowden: ""You actually have people afflicted and in agony in public spaces."" Trade and commerce swiftly shut down, and ""every economic activity disappeared."" The city erected hospitals to isolate the sick. ""You have the burning of sulfur in the streets -- bonfires to purify the air.""

Some 100,000 Londoners -- close to a quarter of the population, equivalent to two million today -- died. Some sufferers committed suicide by ""throwing themselves into the Thames,"" Mr. Snowden says. ""Such was their horror at what was happening to their bodies, and the excruciating pain of the buboes"" -- inflamed lymph nodes -- that are the classic symptom of the bubonic plague. Social order broke down as the authorities fled. ""Death cart"" drivers went door to door, collecting corpses for a fee and sometimes plundering the possessions of survivors.

The plague's violent assaults on European cities in the Middle Ages and Renaissance periods created ""social dislocation in a way we can't imagine,"" says Mr. Snowden, whose October 2019 book, ""Epidemics in Society: From the Black Death to the Present"" -- a survey of infectious diseases and their social impact -- is suddenly timely.

I interviewed Mr. Snowden, 73, over Skype. We're both home in lockdown, I in California and he in Rome, where he's gone to do research in the Vatican archives. In the mid-14th century, Italy was ""the most scourged place in Europe with the Black Death,"" he notes. In the 21st century, it's among the countries hardest hit by Covid-19.

Science has consigned the plague, caused by the flea- and rat-borne bacterium Yersinia pestis, to the margins of public-health concern (though it remains feared as a potential aerosolized bioweapon). Yet its legacy raises challenging questions about how the coronavirus might change the world.

For all the modern West's biomedical prowess, some of its blunt tools against a poorly understood disease are similar to what was first attempted in the 14th century. Take quarantine. Hundreds of millions of Americans and Europeans are isolated in their homes in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

Isolation as a defense against infectious disease originated in the city-states of Venice and Florence. Italy was the center of Mediterranean trade, and the plague arrived in 1347 on commercial ships. The dominant theory at the time was ""miasmatism"" -- the atmosphere was poisoned -- perhaps by visitors' garments -- and people get sick ""when they breathe that in, or absorb it through their pores,"" Mr. Snowden says. ""That is, there is some emanation, and it can be thought to be coming from the soil, or from the bodies"" of sick people.

After plague visitations, the Venetian navy eventually began to force sailors arriving at the harbor to disembark on a nearby island, where they remained for 40 days -- quaranta -- a duration chosen for its biblical significance. The strategy worked when it was enforced as disease-ridden fleas died out and the sick died or recovered. Mr. Snowden notes that Americans returning from Wuhan, China, in early February were ""detained on army bases for a quarantine period"" -- 14 days rather than 40.

""We can see the roots of many aspects of modern health already in the Renaissance,"" he adds. Another example is the wax ""plague costume"" worn by physicians. It resembled modern-day medical garb -- ""the protective garments that you see in the hospital for people dealing with Ebola, or this sort of space suit"" -- but with a long beak containing resonant herbs. They were thought to ""purify the air that you were breathing in."" The costume ""did, in fact, have some protective value,"" Mr. Snowden says, because the wax repelled the fleas that carried the disease.

Antiplague efforts dramatically changed Europeans' relationship to government. ""The Florentines established what were called health magistrates, which are the ancestors of what today we call boards of health or departments of health,"" Mr. Snowden explains. ""Endowed with special legal powers,"" they coordinated plague countermeasures.

The plague was more traumatic than a military assault, and the response was often warlike in its ferocity. One response was a ""sanitary cordon,"" or encircling of a city-state with soldiers, who didn't allow anyone in or out. ""Imagine one's own city, and suddenly, in the morning, it's cordoned off by the National Guard with fixed bayonets and helmets on, and orders to shoot if we cross,"" Mr. Snowden says. Cordons were regularly imposed in European cities in times of plague risk, leading to terror and violence. In the 18th century, the Austrian army was ""deployed to prevent bubonic plague from moving up the Balkan Peninsula and into Western Europe"" by halting travelers who might be carrying it.

The sociologist Charles Tilly (1929-2008) famously argued that ""war makes the state"" -- that borders and bureaucracies were forged by necessity in military conflict. Plague had similar effects, requiring ""military commitment, administration, finance and all the rest of it,"" Mr. Snowden says. In addition to a navy to enforce quarantines, ""you needed to have a police power,"" a monopoly on force over a wide area. Sometimes ""watchmen were stationed outside the homes of people who had the plague, and no one was allowed in or out.""

Yet while the plague saw power move up from villages and city-states to national capitals, the coronavirus is encouraging a devolution of authority from supranational units to the nation-state. This is most obvious in the European Union, where member states are setting their own responses. Open borders within the EU have been closed, and some countries have restricted export of medical supplies. The virus has heightened tensions between the U.S. and China, as Beijing tries to protect its image and Americans worry about access to medical supply chains.

The coronavirus is threatening ""the economic and political sinews of globalization, and causing them to unravel to a certain degree,"" Mr. Snowden says. He notes that ""coronavirus is emphatically a disease of globalization."" The virus is striking hardest in cities that are ""densely populated and linked by rapid air travel, by movements of tourists, of refugees, all kinds of businesspeople, all kinds of interlocking networks.""

The social dynamics of a pandemic are determined partly by who is most affected. Cholera, for example, ""is famously associated with social and class tensions and turmoil,"" Mr. Snowden says. A vicious gastrointestinal infection, it was most prevalent in crowded urban tenements with contaminated food or water. ""We could pick Naples, or we could pick New York City in the 19th century,"" he says. ""Municipal officials, the authorities, the doctors, the priests, the middle classes, the wealthy, who live in different neighborhoods, are not succumbing to this disease."" That led to conspiracy theories about its origin, and to working-class riots.

Similarly, the bubonic plague struck India, then a British colony, in the late 19th century. The British responded by introducing Renaissance-era antiplague measures -- ""very draconian exercises of power and authority, but by a colonial government, over the native population,"" Mr. Snowden says. ""The population of India regarded this as more fearful than the plague itself"" and resisted. Britain, worried that ""this would be the beginning of modern Indian nationalism,"" backed off the measures, which were mostly ineffective anyway.

Respiratory viruses, Mr. Snowden says, tend to be socially indiscriminate in whom they infect. Yet because of its origins in the vectors of globalization, the coronavirus appears to have affected the elite in a high-profile way. From Tom Hanks to Boris Johnson, people who travel frequently or are in touch with travelers have been among the first to get infected.

That has shaped the political response in the U.S., as the Democratic Party, centered in globalized cities, demands an intensive response. Liberal professionals may also be more likely to be able to work while isolated at home. Republican voters are less likely to live in dense areas with high numbers of infections and so far appear less receptive to dramatic countermeasures.

Infectious disease can change the physical landscape itself. Mr. Snowden notes that when Napoleon III rebuilt Paris in the mid-19th century, one of his objectives was to protect against cholera: ""It was this idea of making broad boulevards, where the sun and light could disperse the miasma."" Cholera also prompted expansions of regulatory power over the ""construction of houses, how they had to be built, the cleanliness standards."" If respiratory viruses become a more persistent feature of life in the West, changes to public transportation and zoning could also be implemented based on our understanding of science -- which, like Napoleon's, is sure to be built upon or superseded in later years.

In ancient literature, from Homer's ""Iliad"" to the Old Testament, plagues are associated with the idea that man is being punished for his sins, Mr. Snowden observes. Venetian churches were built to demonstrate repentance. Mr. Snowden also highlights the Flagellants of the 14th and 15th centuries, who would embark on a ""40-day procession of repentance, self-chastisement and prayer,"" whipping themselves and others.

For Europeans who survived the plague, Mr. Snowden says, it impressed the idea that ""you could be struck down at any moment without warning,"" so you should focus on your immortal soul. Paintings often featured symbols like ""an hourglass with the sands running out, a flower that's wilting.""

Coronavirus is far less lethal, but it does shatter assumptions about the resilience of the modern world. Mr. Snowden says that after World War II ""there was real confidence that all infectious disease were going to be a thing of the past."" Chronic and hereditary diseases would remain, but ""the infections, the contagions, the pandemics, would no longer exist because of science."" Since the 1990s -- in particular the avian flu outbreak of 1997 -- experts have understood that ""there are going to be many more epidemic diseases,"" especially respiratory infections that jump from animals to humans. Nonetheless, the novel coronavirus caught the West flat-footed.

It's too early to say what political and economic imprint this pandemic will leave in its wake. As Mr. Snowden says, ""there's much more that isn't known than is known."" Yet with a mix of intuition and luck, Renaissance Europeans often kept at bay a gruesome plague whose provenance and mechanisms they didn't understand. Today science is capable of much more. But modernity has also left our societies vulnerable in ways 14th-century Venetians could never have imagined.

U.S. News --- THE OUTLOOK: Jobs Report Will Mask Virus's Heft

Corrections & Amplifications

The last name of Brent Neiman, a University of Chicago economist, was misspelled as Nieman in The Outlook column in Monday's U.S. News section.

(WSJ March 31, 2020)

(END)

The March employment report will show a hit to the U.S. job market due to the novel coronavirus pandemic, but it is unlikely to show the depth of the crash because the data reflect the month's first weeks.

Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect Friday's report to show U.S. employers shed 56,000 jobs from payrolls -- snapping a record 113-month stretch of job creation -- and the unemployment rate edged up to 3.7% from a 50-year low of 3.5% in February.

Both predictions, from a survey of eight economists late last week, are far less dire than the picture drawn by the record 3.3 million Americans who filed for unemployment benefits from March 15 through 21, after many government authorities ordered closures of swaths of the economy to stem the virus's spread.

That's because the March report, like nearly all Labor Department employment reports, is based on surveys asking about the week or pay period that includes the 12th day of the month. A survey of households that determines the unemployment rate asked Americans if they reported to work during the week of March 8-14. If respondents were paid for a single hour of work that week -- even if they were subsequently laid off -- they are counted as employed.

As a result, the March jobs report will primarily reflect the labor market in the first two weeks of the month, when the U.S. was struggling to ramp up testing for the virus. That was before the number of virus-related infections and deaths jumped and several governors ordered nonessential businesses to close, forcing layoffs of millions of Americans, including waiters, hotel staff, auto workers and dental hygienists.

Friday's report is ""not going to really capture the significant damage out there that occurred,"" said Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist at RSM US LLC. ""Investors and policy makers should just throw it out. It's just a remembrance of things past.""

If the shutdowns continue for a few more weeks, the April jobs report, scheduled for release May 8, could show the greatest one-month deterioration of the labor market on record.

Depending on how the pandemic evolves, the report released in May could show unemployment soaring toward double digits and more than one million jobs slashed. That would mark the largest one-month drop in payrolls since Japan surrendered to the U.S. in September 1945, prompting the country to wind down its wartime efforts.

Future jobs reports could be even worse.

A rule of thumb, Mr. Brusuelas said, is that unemployment rises by 1 percentage point for every 1.5 million initial jobless claims. Given last week's record-shattering unemployment claims, the jobless rate will likely approach at least 6% in April and exceed 10% by midsummer, Mr. Brusuelas said, adding the numbers could keep climbing.

That's because a huge number of American workers are employed in service industries that have been shuttered. Leisure and hospitality -- hotels, restaurants, arts and entertainment -- employed 16.9 million Americans as of February, Labor Department data show.

While millions of workers are working remotely now, just 34% of American jobs can plausibly be performed at home, University of Chicago economists Jonathan Dingel and Brent Nieman estimate.

""There is the chance we could see depression-like unemployment numbers by the time we're through,"" Mr. Brusuelas said.

The Labor Department's survey of employers asks for their establishment's head count for the payroll period that includes March 12. If a worker was paid for any portion of that period, they are counted as being on a payroll.

Erica Groshen, the former commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, said underlying data in the report could give clues to the virus's emerging impact. Watch for employment cuts in temporary-help jobs and the number of hours worked. It's possible wage growth could tick up, because the first wave of job cuts hit lower-wage workers while better-paid employees were more likely to be able to work remotely -- causing the average to rise.

The coming report is also subject to unusual statistical distortions. Survey responses could be low if businesses have closed. Statistical models that smooth seasonal patterns and predict the pace at which business close and open could be worthless. And some of the people who lost their jobs may be counted as out of the labor force, rather than unemployed, because they aren't actively seeking work at a time when the virus has shut businesses and many are responsible for caring for children or ill family members.

Some economists are bracing for a darker report on Friday. Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors, forecasts the data will show 1.25 million jobs were shed and the unemployment rate jumped to 5.2%.

""I know I'm on the high side,"" he said. ""But the jobless-claims data tell me a lot more workers got laid off early in the month than people realized."" Mr. Naroff said business closures and layoffs in hard-hit areas such as New York City occurred early enough to get counted in this report.

Like many economists, he sees the March data as the tip of the iceberg. He predicts the economy could shed upward of 10 million jobs during the pandemic, and the unemployment rate will top 14%.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Fed Now Armed With Greater Firepower --- Central bank gets lending responsibility that is typically left up to elected officials

The Federal Reserve quickly deployed a half-dozen emergency lending programs over the past two weesks to ensure cash keeps coursing through the U.S. financial system. Now, Congress wants it to go much further, approving $454 billion to reload the Fed's own ability to lend.

Washington is relying on the Fed, to an unprecedented degree in peacetime, to preserve business balance sheets after elected officials and private industry have put the economy into the equivalent of a medically induced coma to stop the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

The economic-rescue legislation President Trump signed on Friday asks the Fed to charge headlong into credit and fiscal policy, by financing businesses, states and cities. These are areas the central bank has normally regarded as matters best left to elected officials.

""Congress is the Fed's boss and Congress has mandated them to lend to areas of the economy that they were previously uncomfortable doing,"" said Julia Coronado, a former Fed economist and founder of economic-advisory firm MacroPolicy Perspectives.

The Fed has essentially unlimited power to lend during a crisis as long as officials consider their loans well-secured. By providing the Treasury Department with a sizable pot of money, Congress has given the central bank more flexibility to ramp up lending because the Treasury will agree to absorb initial losses.

""This is an opportunity to leverage the unlimited balance sheet of the Fed,"" Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) told reporters last week. ""It's totally unprecedented. We're hoping that it's a mechanism to keep business alive.""

The move to entrust the Fed with more responsibility marks an about-face for both Congress and Mr. Trump, who has unsparingly criticized the central bank and the man he picked to lead it, Jerome Powell. Ten years ago, Congress curbed the very emergency-lending authorities lawmakers are now asking the Fed to use, after popular outrage over how the central bank exercised those powers following the failures of Bear Stearns and American International Group Inc.

The Fed's longstanding reluctance to coordinate with fiscal policy dates to an accord with the Treasury Department in 1951. It was reached after the Fed overrode the Truman administration's demands to maintain pegs that had fixed yields on Treasury securities to support the economy during and after World War II.

""There is a long history of coordination between the Fed, the administration, and Congress ending in a bad place,"" said Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist now at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a liberal think tank.""That shows how severe the situation is.""

By outsourcing more of the crisis response to the Fed, lawmakers are signaling both a vote of confidence in the central bank while potentially shielding themselves from blame for difficult decisions that lie ahead, saidMark Spindel, a Washington-based investment manager who co-wrote a book on the Fed's historical relationship with the White House and Congress.

""To Jay's credit, he has worked extensively to forge that connective tissue with Congress, so the individual and the institution are seen as objective; in the best sense, technocratic; and independent of the hyper-partisanship"" in Washington, said Mr. Spindel.

The Fed's initial response borrowed from the programs developed by former Chairman Ben Bernanke, who during the 2008 financial crisis broke the seal on lending authorities the Fed hadn't employed since Great Depression.

The Fed can't lend directly to companies but, with the approval of the Treasury secretary, it can create special facilities that extend credit. The Treasury has kicked in $10 billion for each of five facilities, including two that will support markets for large firms' debt.

The new Treasury infusions are likely to support another facility the Fed has said it would create to lend to potentially thousands of midsize businesses, likely through the banks that can borrow directly from the Fed -- a massive operational enterprise unlike anything the central bank has done.

The central bank is also looking into ways to prevent higher borrowing costs from exacerbating strains for state and local treasuries.

As these facilities are launched, officials are likely to face tricky questions about how much further to intervene in credit markets, especially now that they will have more funds available to take losses. Existing facilities have limited lending to the highest-rated borrowers.

State Street: Critics Complain State Budget Is Being Crafted in Secrecy

Advocacy groups of all stripes are concerned they have been shut out of the state budget negotiations set to conclude this week, a deal one longtime watchdog said is taking shape in ""unprecedented secrecy.""

The state Capitol in March normally teems with lobbyists, citizens and officials from around the state pushing to be heard as the budget comes together. State legislators' days are scheduled to the minute, and people seeking their attention can be lucky to get in a few moments during a chance encounter near the floor of the chamber.

All that ceased when the building closed to visitors on March 15 as the coronavirus spread. Legislators voted on a handful of bills on March 18, but remain scattered around the state. The traditional avenues of influence adapted by necessity.

On Friday, Citizen Action of New York, a progressive advocacy group, held a ""car rally"" where people honked on the street outside the Capitol to protest any changes to the state's new bail law, which eliminated cash bail for most misdemeanor and nonviolent felony offenses.

For most of January and February, the group held weekly rallies inside the building, arguing that the law -- which took effect Jan. 1 -- has reduced economic and racial disparities in the criminal justice system.

Law-enforcement officials as well as elected leaders in both parties, including New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, believe the bail law should be amended to let judges consider public safety when deciding whether to hold defendants before their trials.

""To roll back the bail law now or down the line is to set up for devastation in the face of this pandemic,"" because it is difficult to contain the virus in jails, said Erin George, the civil rights campaign director for Citizen Action.

The Alliance for Quality Education, which advocates for greater school funding, held a virtual news conference on Friday to urge legislators to raise taxes on the wealthy rather than cut services.

Brian Sampson, president of the Associated Builders and Contractors, Empire State Chapter, said the contractors he represents had to fall back on letter-writing and social-media campaigns to lobby lawmakers. Contractors are battling against building-trade unions over a provision that would broaden the definition of public works that require a higher, prevailing wage rate.

""It's obviously been very difficult. You're relying on phone calls, text messages and emails, and you're hoping your message is being heard,"" Mr. Sampson said.

Leaders of the state Senate and Assembly, both of which are controlled by Democrats, didn't release their own draft budgets to counter the $178 billion spending plan Gov. Andrew Cuomo unveiled in January.

Instead, the Democratic governor has been talking directly with Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins. This practice of three people in a room is common in Albany, but without rank-and-file lawmakers close by, regular briefings have been relegated to conference calls.

""Albany in the best of times is secretive,"" said Blair Horner, a longtime leader of the New York Public Interest Research Group, a watchdog organization. ""We're now entering a black hole of information where even light can't escape. It's as dark as dark can be. Unless you're hiring the hot-wired lobbyists, it's hard to find out what's going on.""

Mr. Cuomo has appeared regularly in the Capitol to offer updates on the state's response to the coronavirus outbreak, and he has fielded some budget questions. The coronavirus has had big impacts on the state economy and decreased revenue projections by around 15%.

""This is the easiest budget we've done,"" Mr. Cuomo joked to a legislator recently and recounted during a public radio interview. ""We have no money.""

U.S. News: Electric Vehicles Dinged by State Fees

More states are imposing special registration fees on electric vehicles, sparking complaints that the levies undermine efforts to get consumers to embrace alternative-fuel cars.

Twenty-eight states charge from $50 to more than $200 a year for plug-in electric cars, and 14 states have annual fees for plug-in hybrids that also use gasoline, according to the nonpartisan National Conference of State Legislatures.

The fees are meant to make up for the fact that electric-vehicle owners don't buy gas and thus don't pay gas taxes that states rely on for road work. The fees are generally in addition to standard vehicle registration fees.

""There was practically no fee in place just a few years ago, and we've seen this massive growth,"" said Kristy Hartman, NCSL's energy program director.

In 2019, plug-in vehicles made up just 2% of U.S. sales, or about 330,000 cars and trucks out of about 17 million overall. But officials are preparing for a future when a far higher share of drivers won't be fueling up at the pump, Ms. Hartman said.

To promote electric-vehicle purchases, a majority of states offer hefty tax incentives and other perks.

Some states offer incentives and impose fees, which sends conflicting signals to consumers, said Genevieve Cullen, president of the Electric Drive Transportation Association, which includes auto makers, suppliers and other industry players. Tesla Inc., General Motors Co. and Nissan Motor Co. are members.

""Often those fees are in effect penalizing efficiency and innovation,"" Ms. Cullen said.

A Consumer Reports analysis last year found 11 states charge electric-vehicle owners more than what a typical driver of a new gas-powered car pays in gas taxes. Among them is Georgia, which has the nation's highest fee at $213, according to NCSL.

Atlanta resident Christopher Matos-Rogers and his husband both drive Teslas. Mr. Matos-Rogers, 35 years old, said they can afford the fees but he thinks $75 to $100 a year would be a fair amount.

""It's very punitive, and it's exorbitant compared to a similar gas car,"" he said.

Ms. Hartman, who lives in Colorado, said when she bought an electric Nissan Leaf last year, she received a $7,500 federal tax credit, a $5,000 state tax credit and a $3,500 rebate from an electric utility. She also paid a $50 recurring state registration fee.

States with fees span the political spectrum and include California, which has by far the most electric vehicles and offers incentives including a rebate of up to $7,000. It began charging a $100 fee for purchases of 2020 model-year cars.

Jonathan Williams, chief economist for the American Legislative Exchange Council, which advocates for free markets, said the fees are appropriate. ""Let's make sure everybody who uses the roads pays something toward keeping them up,"" he said.

Gas taxes are states' largest revenue source for fixing and maintaining roads and bridges. The relative value of gas taxes has fallen due to factors like improved fuel efficiency and the federal government's shifting more infrastructure costs to states, according to a recent National Governors Association report.

The report said an annual flat fee on electric vehicles can disproportionately affect low-income drivers and that ""exceptionally high"" fees risk slowing adoption of the technology.

Streetwise: There'll Be Debt to Pay After Crisis

Moral hazard is dead. Central banks have printed record amounts of money to save financiers and allow indebted governments to keep spending. Inflation is inevitable.

If all that sounds familiar, it's because those were the views of buyers of gold and other inflation protection in 2009. They were wrong then, but they're at it again -- and this time they might be right.

Consider Ruffer, a bearish British investment house. It has been warning for a long time that the monetary regime that has held for decades was coming to an end, and thinks the coronavirus crisis means its time finally has come. ""Inflation and deflation are not opposites,"" says Alex Lennard, investment director at Ruffer. ""You can emerge from quite deflationary environments into very rapid inflation.""

Ruffer's investors have made money this year in crashing markets thanks to its extensive use of options to protect against stock-price falls. They did well in the 2008 crisis, too. But their long-run bet is that the overhang of debt from the current shutdown will prevent central banks raising rates to combat consumer price rises, meaning inflation running in the mid-to-high single digits.

Mr. Lennard says Ruffer last week bought 30-year inflation-linked Treasurys when they declined in price, adding to a longstanding position in 50-year U.K. inflation-linked gilts and gold.

This crisis is different in many ways the previous one, but the argument about inflation is the same. Will governments choose austerity and higher taxes to pay off the heavy debt incurred fighting the crisis? This route doesn't lead to inflation, but it's politically difficult. Instead, Ruffer expects governments to take the easy option and rely on central banks, perhaps even by directly financing government spending, a recipe for inflation throughout history. Such ""helicopter money"" is widely thought to be a possibility for the Federal Reserve, which has already reduced interest rates to zero.

Still, in 2008, Ruffer was wrong that deflation would be followed by inflation. It's possible that governments might once again muddle through, relying on the deflationary forces unleashed by the internet and globalization to keep prices from rising -- but it will be harder this time.

Jean-Claude Trichet, former president of the European Central Bank, says the most-optimistic debt scenario is that inflation rises only back to the 2% target, but rates stay well below that for a very long time. That would help to reduce the value of government debt in inflation-adjusted terms, with holders of the bonds suffering.

""Other scenarios would be much more dramatic, including either a sequence of defaults or hyperinflation triggered by very loose fiscal and monetary policies,"" he told me. ""The best-case scenario relies upon great soundness of fiscal policies, great effectiveness of structural policies anda combination of monetary policy and of micro- and macro-prudentials (regulatory policy) of extreme efficiency.""

He added: ""Its likelihood will be in the hands of our future masters. As regards fiscal policies, what was observed since the [2008] global financial crisis does not bode well for the necessary future soundness.""

The lesson of history is that it could go either way. The result in the U.S. after 2008 was more akin to what happened in Japan after its housing and stock-market bubbles burst in 1990: Inflation never took off despite easy money and huge government deficits, but growth continued.

Stephen King, senior economic adviser to HSBC, points to the repayment of debt after the world wars as an example of the different options ahead. After World War II, rapid economic growth and a regime of deliberately low interest rates that allowed governments to borrow cheaply -- financial repression -- helped reduce the burden of debt. By contrast, after World War I, several large debtor countries reduced debt through default or hyperinflation. The U.K.'s fierce austerity as it insisted on a strong pound hurt the economy and failed to deal with the debt burden.

""It's quite possible that, in the aftermath of all this, there will be attempts to claw back money from holders of capital,"" Mr. King says. One option is the wealth taxes advocated by some Democrats, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren.

But it is politically easier to deal with debt with the help of the central bank. Financial repression can be used to keep interest rates below the inflation rate, reducing the value of government debt in real terms but costing savers and bondholders -- and risking higher inflation. The Fed tried this policy after World War II, capping bond yields for six years and being subservient to the Treasury Department, before asserting its independence.

""Financial repression is a given,"" says Frederik Ducrozet, a senior economist at Pictet Wealth Management and close observer of the ECB. Most countries will be able to cope with the additional debt without extreme measures, he thinks, although Italy may struggle without pan-European debt sharing, a version of which has already been proposed by French President Emmanuel Macron.

For investors, the short-term swings in markets have been so extreme that it's hard to think beyond a few days, let alone the years over which the postcrisis debt resolution will play out. But it's worth considering now, because the portfolio needed to cope with central banks either letting inflation rip or imposing financial repression would be quite different to one designed to profit from a return to what has counted as normal since 2009.

How to Fix a Drug Scandal

Wednesday, Netflix

The original ""Law & Order"" used to boast that its stories were ripped from the headlines. The engrossing ""How to Fix a Drug Scandal"" might have been ripped from ""Law & Order'"" -- if the new four-part series weren't a thrilling piece of nonfiction. It has the same crime-and-punishment arc as the old show, the same gift for animating legal minutiae, the same relentless forward motion. Plus, everything in it is true. And there are monsters.

Monsters can be good or bad; the word itself is almost as ambiguous as ""fix"" -- something that suddenly meant different things to different people in 2012 Massachusetts, as a two-headed scandal started to boil over between crime labs in the commonwealth. In Amherst, a chemist named Sonja Farak was found to have been habitually dipping into the evidence (which included methamphetamine, cocaine and LSD). In Boston, another drug-tester named Annie Dookhan, the kind of employee who turned the lights on in the morning and off at night, had been producing test results at a rate no one thought was possible -- and wasn't, as the authorities rather belatedly discovered.

""How to Fix a Drug Scandal"" is full of surprises, one of them being how seamlessly director Erin Lee Carr (""At the Heart of Gold: Inside the USA Gymnastics Scandal"") melds two cases of such contrasting characters, circumstances and motivations. Ms. Farak, who had been her high-school class valedictorian as well as a member of the boys' varsity football team, kept to herself and her drugs, carefully consuming either the pure samples kept in the lab or the evidence that came through it. Ms. Dookhan, as indicated by emails and testimony, was a habitual liar as well as outrageously -- and feloniously -- ambitious. Ms. Farak did the work, though it was inherently compromised. Ms. Dookhan simply didn't do the work.

What was common to the cases were two questions: How long had each woman been mishandling evidence? And, consequently, how many convictions were compromised? As the series shows, the ""fix"" attempted by the Massachusetts criminal justice system -- in the persons of then-Attorney General Martha Coakley and assistant AGs Anne Kaczmarek and Kris Foster -- was to spin the damage as having been short-term and, when that didn't work, to withhold evidence and mislead the courts. It isn't spelled out, but the fact that so many Massachusetts prosecutors talk so frankly to Ms. Carr's camera may be the result of the attorney general's office having misled them, too. The office received a rare castigation from the bench for its performance.

The re-creations feature an actress (Shannon O'Neill) who looks enough not like Ms. Farak to cause some puzzlement, but she makes a good point (lifted from testimony): ""I never had any piece [of evidence] questioned,"" she says, meaning the accused had never claimed that the evidence against them hadn't been actual drugs. But Luke Ryan, the attorney for several clients whose cases had been tainted by Ms. Farak, makes the counter argument, and makes it well, that the state is both required and obliged to prove that what it is charging is true, including the authenticity of the drugs involved. The testing process must be above reproach, something Ms. Farak and Ms. Dookhan rendered impossible.

The level of misconduct is startling, as is the tenacity of Mr. Ryan, the hero of the series who keeps turning up enough proof of that misconduct that he and his fellow litigants, all of whom wanted convictions overturned, can't be ignored. What may catch a viewer off guard is how gripping the story is and how it flies by. Heather Harris, a forensic chemist who appears among Ms. Carr's interviewees as a kind of general expert witness about crime labs and chemistry, says early in the series that the public doesn't know much about the kind of work performed, or not, by Ms. Farak and Ms. Dookhan, because ""it doesn't make for compelling, interesting stories.""

""Then why are we here?"" she's asked.

""Well,"" Ms. Harris answers, smiling, ""sometimes it does.""

U.S. News -- Capital Account: How to Avoid Another Great Recession

The U.S. economy has suffered a body blow with no modern precedent. Unemployment, just 3.5% in February, could top 10% in coming months, higher than its peak in the 2008-09 recession. Some see it surpassing 20% soon, levels unseen since the Great Depression.

But it isn't a foregone conclusion that this must wreak as much damage as the great recession, much less the Depression. It depends not just on how high unemployment goes but how long it stays there. That, in turn, depends on whether businesses and workers, with the aid of government, can stay afloat for as long as it takes to stop the pandemic.

This isn't like other recessions, in which businesses and consumers are unwilling to spend. This time they are unable to spend. It resembles a natural disaster such as a hurricane that closes an entire affected region. Businesses and employees typically treat a natural disaster as transitory and pick up afterward where they left off. The difference is that this one is shutting down most of the country, potentially for months. The longer it drags on, the more businesses will fail and the more temporary layoffs become permanent, with knock-on effects on spending and employment that become difficult to reverse.

While we don't know much about the economic effects of pandemics, we know a lot about the effects of natural disasters.

The week after Hurricane Harvey's landfall in 2017, the typical Houston business's incoming cash plummeted 63% relative to a year earlier, and 31% had no cash coming in at all. That is according to a JPMorgan Chase Institute study of thousands of anonymized accounts.

Importantly, businesses' cashout flows also significantly shrank, preserving somewhat their cash balances. And within a week, cash inflows returned to normal in both cities. A surge in temporary layoffs didn't translate into a significant or sustained drop in employment.

While the bank's in-house think tank didn't study Hurricane Katrina, that storm's severity in 2005 and the slow pace of rebuilding left lasting economic scars. Employment in the New Orleans area immediately plunged 30%. Two years later, only half that drop had been recovered, and, according to one study, a third of businesses had failed to reopen.

The priority now is to avoid New Orleans' post-Katrina fate. That requires enabling businesses, as best as possible, to hang on until the pandemic emergency is over.

Lauren Knox has owned a hair salon in Huntsville, Ala., since 1989. In 2011, she was forced to close for 10 days when tornadoes tore across the Southern U.S. She still remembers dividing up the cash the salon had on hand to help tide over her employees. It helped prepare her for the pandemic, to an extent. On March 3, she had her employees sign a plan of action, in which she said: ""Like any other disruption in our lives, like a tornado, etc., we ride it out together. ""A week ago, to protect their and their customers' health, she closed her salon and told her seven support staff, seven commissioned stylists, and 11 stylists who rent a salon chair from her, to stay home.

None, so far, have been laid off. Her hope is that when the pandemic passes, she can reopen and bring all those staff back. But she has just $7,000 in cash on hand and, assuming she cuts all operating expenses, still has fixed monthly expenses of rent, utilities and insurance of around $7,200.

""I did make the decision to pay my support staff two weeks out of pocket and hope this stimulus and relief will bridge that gap soon,"" Ms. Knox said, referring to the $2 trillion-plus relief package signed last week. ""I'm up to date on all my bills for April. But I can't continue through May without some assistance.""

Most workers have skills and experience that are specific to their current jobs. The longer they spend looking for a new one, the more that human capital depreciates, delivering a lasting hit to income and thus spending. Separate research by the JPMorgan Chase Institute found that those unemployed six months or more had cut spending by 13% a year after losing their jobs, compared with 1% for those unemployed under six months.

Research by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development found thatin the past, recession unemployment rose less in countries where employers thought the downturn was seen as transitory. That was especially notable in Germany, which encourages employers to reduce each worker's hours rather than cut workers altogether.

The U.S. has traditionally resisted subsidizing employers to keep workers, preferring instead to subsidize the unemployed as they search for a new job. The economic-rescue package breaks that tradition. Besides money for unemployment benefits, it includes $350 billion in forgivable Small Business Administration loans and $500 billion in direct loans and seed money for Federal Reserve credit, all conditional on minimizing layoffs. Speed is essential for the program to succeed, and that alone may not be enough. If the pandemic lasts many more months, or returns in the fall, last week's package may not be enough.

Global View
U.S. Leadership Will Survive Coronavirus

By Walter Russell Mead

There are two epidemics raging across the U.S. today: the coronavirus and a febrile sense of national failure. Just like the so-called Flagellants, who roamed across Europe during the Black Death beating themselves with scourges and bewailing their sins, pundits and politicians now solemnly intone that a failed coronavirus response proves that American society is sick and American global leadership is dead.

Certainly the initial U.S. response was flawed. The Trump administration and local and state officials should have made much better use of the time gained by President Trump's much-criticized but now universally imitated coronavirus travel bans. The time could have been used to get the country in substantially better shape for testing and treatment, and an earlier adoption of strict social-distance protocols would have impeded the spread of the virus significantly and reduced the projected death toll.

Barring the sudden appearance of a miracle cure, the disaster will likely ripple across the country, testing medical facilities and all levels of government to -- and, in some cases, past -- their breaking points. Each piece of bad news will stimulate our modern day Flagellants to histrionic transports of passionate handwringing. Each week's New Yorker issue will be more cuttingly eloquent than the last.

It is, however, much too soon to say that America is failing a historic test. What is it being graded against? Thanks to bad strategic and operational decisions in 1941, U.S. Pacific forces were sitting ducks when war broke out. Except mercifully for its aircraft carriers, the Pacific fleet was concentrated and poorly guarded in Pearl Harbor. This was followed by a debacle in the Philippines. Caught in an indefensible position, by April 1942 more than 22,000 American military personnel were captured or surrendered, and 10,000 underwent the infamous Bataan Death March into brutal captivity.

These costly blunders were less excusable and more expensive than anything we've done wrong so far in this crisis. They made the war longer and bloodier than it would otherwise have been -- but victory came in the end. The Civil War, World War I, even the Cold War saw a similar pattern of fecklessness and confusion in the early stages.

America generally starts slowly. Our national genius is for the private economy and private pursuits. When crisis comes, it takes the U.S. more time than many countries to move to an emergency footing and coordinate the many moving parts of its society; to get the various state, local and federal authorities to mesh; and to get the private and public sectors working together effectively. The U.S. typically stumbles out of the starting gate, but once it gets going, the ingenuity, adaptability and dedication of the American people enable it to make up the lost ground.

Fears of a collapse of U.S. leadership abroad are also overblown. The only way we can really help others at this point is to put America first. If our country is paralyzed by a devastating epidemic, and our economy crashes and burns, we won't be able to help anybody with anything. America First at this moment isn't a slogan for chauvinism. It's common sense.

This isn't only true for the U.S. The best gift any country can give the world at this time is to master its own difficulties, succor its own people, and prepare to play its part in the global resurgence.

Even so, America has already done far more to fight the pandemic and its consequences than any other country. China has sent a few high-profile shipments of often-defective medical supplies, usually at top-dollar prices; the Federal Reserve opened dollar-swap lines that kept the world economy from freezing up.

Medical systems in Africa and elsewhere that were built with American aid to fight HIV and Ebola have given dozens of countries capacities they wouldn't otherwise have possessed. With both the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank arguing that it's vital to reduce debt burdens and help emerging countries deal with the massive costs of the crisis, Washington is working with Group of Seven and G-20 countries to respond to the need. One suspects this activity would get more attention if a Democrat were in the White House, but it is a more than respectable record for a country still getting to grips with a once-in-a-century event.

The true test of leadership has yet to come. America can't help the world much if it is flat on its back. But as the U.S. rises, it can help others up, too -- and it will be in America's interest to do so. Americans can't stay healthy if the pandemic continues to surge around the globe, and our economy won't prosper for long unless the world recovers with it.

The U.S. may yet fail to meet the test that history is giving it, and if it does there will be plenty of opportunity for self-flagellation and woe. But the American response to date, flawed as it is, suggests that the strengths that brought the U.S. through even worse crises in the past have not yet faded away.

Lawmakers Clash Over Medicaid in Budget

Lawmakers and unions criticized Gov. Andrew Cuomo for pushing ahead with a plan to reduce Medicaid spending as part of the state budget due Tuesday even as New York responds to the novel coronavirus pandemic.

Several Democrats who control the state Senate, as well as labor and progressive groups, warned that cuts to the program, which provides health care to more than 6 million New Yorkers, would be devastating. They urged Mr. Cuomo to accept federal money approved earlier this month and to tax the wealthy rather than making reductions.

""It's absolutely insulting and it's just wrong,"" state Sen. Julia Salazar, a Democrat from Brooklyn, said of the Medicaid changes during a recent news conference.

The cuts, she said, would hurt poor patients and hospitals on the front lines of responding to the epidemic.

The Medicaid issue emerged as a late flashpoint in the budget after the virus shut down large segments of the economy and state tax receipts cratered. The Democratic governor's budget office predicted state revenues were somewhere between $9 billion and $15 billion below the $88 billion projected in February.

""The problem with the budget is the numbers,"" Mr. Cuomo said Sunday. ""I'm not going to pass or sign a phony budget.""

The governor said he didn't support raising taxes. He proposed a $178 billion spending plan in January, but has acknowledged in recent days that circumstances have changed to the point that it is basically moot. A planned 3% increase in the amount of state aid to public schools is now in doubt, he said.

However, Mr. Cuomo said he was forging ahead with a plan to reduce spending in the state's Medicaid program by $2.5 billion.

The state approached its new fiscal year with a $6.1 billion deficit, largely driven by Medicaid cost overruns. The governor filled the gap mostly by assuming higher revenues, as well as $2.5 billion in savings from a so-called Medicaid Redesign Team of industry stakeholders.

The team's recommendations include decreasing the reimbursement rates the state pays for hospitals and nursing homes and changes designed to slow the growth of a long-term-care program in which sick or disabled New Yorkers hire assistants to help them at home.

State officials have looked to Washington for help with the budget, but the governor said there were provisions in the second coronavirus stimulus bill approved by Congress that would block the redesign team's proposals and his plan to shift more Medicaid funding responsibility back to New York City and the state's other counties.

U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that second stimulus bill would provide up to $6 billion a year in additional Medicaid funding for New York. Mr. Cuomo blasted Mr. Schumer, a Democrat from Brooklyn, for agreeing to the provision.

Mr. Cuomo and his budget director, Robert Mujica, said they believe the federal aid might be closer to $4 billion and that they would rather push ahead with the redesign team's recommendations.

""It takes waste and fraud and inefficiency out of the system,"" Mr. Cuomo said. ""I have no choice. Two-and-a-half billion per year recurring is worth more than $6 billion one shot.""

New York Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Yonkers Democrat, said in a television interview last week that the redesign team's proposals were conceived before the coronavirus pandemic and should be revisited.

American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten, whose union includes members in New York, said she was surprised by Mr. Cuomo's position.

""Right now, what's more important is to keep everybody afloat. It's puzzling to me,"" she said.

A third federal stimulus bill included $5.1 billion of direct aid to New York to cover costs associated with the coronavirus. Mr. Cuomo again said the measure left New York shortchanged because it did nothing to alleviate the state's vanishing revenues.

Given the uncertainty, Mr. Cuomo, Ms. Stewart-Cousins and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, all said they are discussing budget language that would give the governor the power to unilaterally cut state spending if its receipts didn't materialize.

China's Secrecy Hides Risk to Nations in Its Debt

A hidden pile of debt threatens dozens of emerging-market countries as the global economy stalls and commodity prices tumble.

An estimated $200 billion of emerging-market debt owed to China has gone unreported in official statistics in recent years. The money is upending assumptions made by yield-hungry investors who have poured roughly $2 trillion into risky emerging markets over the last decade.

Even before the market crash, some borrowers were buckling under their debts to China. Pakistan turned to the International Monetary Fund in 2018 for a bailout. Sri Lanka was forced to cede to China control of a strategically located port to shore up state finances.

U.S. and European economists are drawing parallels to the 1980s debt crisis that shattered growth in Latin America. A global recession would magnify the problem, economists and investors say.

Since the start of the year, dollar-denominated government bond prices have fallen by around 50% or more for some resource-rich countries such as Angola and Ecuador that also owe heavy debts to China. An index tracking emerging-market sovereign bond performance has fallen around 16% while more than $80 billion has flowed out of emerging-markets stocks and bonds since the market turmoil began, according to the Institute of International Finance.

China's rise as a trading and manufacturing power has been extensively studied over the past four decades, but its impact as a financial power is less understood. Exactly how much China has lent is kept under wraps by state-run banks such as China Development Bank and the countries receiving the loans. China's opaque lending can lead investors and organizations to underestimate the risk they are taking when they make loans to these countries or buy their bonds, leading them to lend at rates that might be too low given the potential losses. These include global investors and multilateral lenders such as the World Bank.

Investors ""have to be very, very leery of what's going on,"" said Carmen Reinhart, a Harvard University economist and former IMF official who has studied China's lending practices.

Ms. Reinhart, one of the most influential U.S. economists on financial crises, was part of a team that over the past two years pieced together a data set of Chinese loans. A resulting study by Ms. Reinhart and economists Sebastian Horn and Christoph Trebesch concluded that more than $200 billion of Chinese overseas loans -- around half of all its cross-border lending -- was hidden from public view. Around a dozen of the poorest countries owed debts to China equal to 20% or more of their annual GDP, the research estimated.

""The problem gets most acute in crisis situations,"" said Mr. Trebesch.

Much of the growth can be traced to China's sprawling ""Belt and Road"" initiative, which seeks to open up new trade routes, expand overseas opportunities for Chinese firms and deepen the country's strategic influence through the financing and building of infrastructure.

Large commodity exporters that seek to sell to China are among the roughly 70 countries taking part in China's program, many of which took on Chinese debt during the boom in commodities prices, but whose finances are particularly vulnerable to plunging commodity markets today.

""The debt burden from these projects is very quickly going to become unsustainable for many, many, many countries,"" said Danny Russel, the State Department's top diplomat for East Asia affairs under President Obama. ""This is scary stuff.""

Nigeria, which is Africa's largest economy and depends heavily on oil exports, was one such recipient. Official statistics have presented China as a modest financier for Nigeria in recent years. By the end of 2017, Nigerian government statistics show external debt owed to China was under $2 billion.

In reality, the total debts Nigeria owed to China were more than double that amount, according to the research. Chinese loans have financed infrastructure such as a light-rail project for the capital city of Abuja. Last year, China committed $629 million in financing for the country's first deep-sea port. Nigeria's government is trying to borrow an additional $17 billion from the state-controlled Export-Import Bank of China.

China's lending, most of which is done in dollars, starkly contrasts with that of multinational institutions such as the World Bank. While these groups lend money at below-market rates, China tends to lend at commercial rates, at times securing loans with a country's oil or other natural resources.

Parallels to the 1980s debt crisis in Latin America -- which spurred a ""lost decade"" of growth for Mexico and others -- concern economists today. Just like the earlier case, a prolonged commodities boom fueled lending to resource-rich developing nations. Some economists say China's opaqueness in its lending is reminiscent of the syndicated U.S. bank loans that crippled Latin America decades ago.

""The thing about the Chinese lending is it's not transparent,"" said Kevin Daly, investment manager for emerging-market debt at Aberdeen Standard Investments Inc. ""Countries that do borrow from the Chinese, when you meet with their officials they do offer you a figure, but they don't offer you details of the breakdown or the repayment schedule.""

Southeast Asia has proven a particular focus for Belt and Road projects. Malaysian debts owed to China are estimated to have surged from less than a billion dollars when the initiative launched to more than $12 billion at the end of 2017. In Indonesia, a $4.5 billion loan agreement with China Development Bank is helping the country to push ahead with its first high-speed rail project.

An economic crisis in Pakistan exemplified the risks.As a showcase of the Belt and Road program, China planned a $62 billion building spree across Pakistan, with China-backed ports, railways and other infrastructure to boost growth.

But Pakistani officials now say they hadn't properly assessed Pakistan's fiscal outlook when accepting Chinese loans and projects, which required the use of Chinese contractors in exchange for financing. Chinese-financed power plants, for instance, placed onerous financial obligations on the government, and contributed to a debt crunch that forced Pakistan to seek a bailout from the IMF. Islamabad denies that its debt problem is related to China.

China's government has denied engaging in what critics call ""debt-trap diplomacy."" State-run lenders China Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank of China didn't respond to a request for comment.

China's actions have garnered deeper scrutiny among U.S. officials, with the Trump administration nominating a critic of China's foreign lending practices to lead the World Bank. David Malpass has used the position as the institution's president to continue pushing China for more transparency.

U.S. criticism comes against the backdrop of an intensifying rivalry between the world's two biggest economies, which the coronavirus crisis has inflamed. A specific concern, U.S. officials say, is that China uses indebtedness of weaker neighbors to gain leverage over them and pursue strategic aims.

World News: Saudis Invite Houthi Rebels, Yemen Government for Talks

WASHINGTON -- Saudi Arabia is in daily talks with Iran-aligned Houthi insurgents in Yemen and has invited Houthi representatives and the internationally recognized government in Yemen to peace talks in the kingdom, a senior Saudi official said.

Saudi's ambassador to Yemen, Mohammed al-Jaber, said the proposal for talks to end the five-year war, which has killed more than 100,000 people, remains on the table despite a flare-up in violence over the weekend. The Houthis haven't yet responded to the offer, he said.

Saudi authorities on Saturday said they shot down ballistic missiles fired by the Houthis at its capital Riyadh and another city on the Saudi border with Yemen. A Saudi-led military coalition on Monday responded with airstrikes in San'a, the first such strikes in Yemen's capital in months.

Mr. Jaber said Saudi officials spoke with their Houthi counterparts on Monday to emphasize that the San'a strikes were in response to Saturday's missile attacks and not intended as a re-escalation of the conflict.

""We are committed to our de-escalation,"" Mr. Jaber said. ""We are ready to have a cease-fire in all Yemeni territory if they accept it."" Houthi representatives couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

The oil-rich kingdom is seen as increasingly eager to extricate itself militarily from Yemen, where it intervened five years ago after the Houthis seized San'a and ousted the internationally recognized government.

The Saudi intervention in Yemen has drawn criticism from U.S. lawmakers of both parties and others. The United Nations calls Yemen, plagued by famine and cholera, the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

""The standing invitation to the Houthis to meet face to face for talks after provocative attacks this weekend suggests the Saudis desperately want to end the war in Yemen,"" said Elana DeLozier, a Yemen expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. ""Despite recent territorial gains by the Houthis, the Saudis have stood by their direct channel with the rebel group.""

Efforts to end the conflict have been halting. The warring parties reached an interim peace agreement in December 2018. While that deal halted what the U.N. feared would be a catastrophic battle for the port of Hodeidah, it was never formally implemented and hoped-for talks on a broader settlement of the conflict haven't happened.

Mr. Jaber, speaking by phone from Riyadh, said that before this weekend's violence, the internationally recognized, Saudi-backed Yemeni government of Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi and the Houthis had agreed to de-escalate the conflict and begin confidence-building talks.

The Saudi offer of talks in the kingdom was undertaken at the request of Martin Griffiths, the U.N. special envoy for Yemen, Mr. Jaber said.

Saudi Arabia and the U.S. have accused Iran of arming and training the Houthis. The Saudi-led coalition said in a statement that targets of its airstrikes on Monday included sites manned by experts from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.

While Saudi officials have privately acknowledged they have held direct talks with the Houthis, Mr. Jaber went further. Since last year, he said, there have been daily telephone calls between officials of the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis.

The diplomatic channel was opened last September, after the Houthis announced they would cease missile and drone strikes on Saudi territory, Mr. Jaber said. The Houthi announcement followed devastating attacks on Saudi oil facilities. While the Houthis claimed to have conducted those attacks, Saudi and U.S. officials say Iran was responsible.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: China Manufacturing Perked Up in March

BEIJING -- An official gauge of China's manufacturing activity rebounded strongly in March as work resumptions picked up. However, economists warned that business activity remains far from normal after the coronavirus outbreak.

China's official manufacturing purchasing managers index jumped to 52.0 in March from a low of 35.7 in February, the National Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday.

The result was higher than the median forecast of 51.5 by economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal and above the 50 mark that separates expansion from contraction.

A measure of nonmanufacturing PMI, also released Tuesday, showed service and construction activity similarly rebounding in March, to 52.3 from 29.6 in February.

But the data rebound is largely confined, for now, to an improvement in sentiment after two months in which the economy ground to a near-total halt as the coronavirus swept across China, forcing the government to implement strict prevention measures to prevent its spread.

China's statistics bureau cautioned that the rebound in manufacturing PMI didn't mean China's economic activity had returned to previrus levels, saying that it reflected the resumption of work after more than a month of idleness.

Other more concrete economic indicators for March -- including figures on foreign trade, industrial output, investment and consumption -- will likely show steep year-on-year declines when they are released in the coming days, some analysts predict.

WASHINGTON -- The government will begin sending out stimulus payments to households in the next three weeks and will distribute them automatically, with no action required for most people, officials said.

But some seniors and others who typically don't file returns will need to submit a simple tax return to receive the economic-impact payments, the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service said in an announcement.

The payments will provide $1,200 to most adults and $500 for children under age 17.

The government will create a web portal for people who haven't already provided their direct-deposit information to upload it to the IRS so they can get their money more quickly, the IRS said.

Almost any adult with a Social Security number can qualify, as long as a person isn't a dependent of someone else. Qualifying adults also get the payments for children in their household. People with little or no income will qualify, meaning money will flow to retirees and people who don't normally file tax returns.

People who filed a return for tax year 2018 or 2019 don't need to do anything else to receive the funds. But those who don't usually have to file returns will need to file to receive the payments, the IRS said. The IRS said its website will soon provide information at IRS.gov/coronavirus instructing people in these groups on how to file a 2019 tax return with simple information including their filing status, number of dependents and direct-deposit bank account information.

UAW Leader Faces Possible Ouster Over Harassment Claims

The executive board for the United Auto Workers began a process Monday to remove one of its own members following an internal investigation into allegations he sexually harassed subordinates.

The UAW's governing body filed charges against board member Richard Rankin through the union's formal grievance process, saying the investigation had substantiated allegations of workplace harassment.

The investigation centered on sexual-harassment allegations, according to a person familiar with the matter, and was reported by The Wall Street Journal earlier this month.

Monday's charges, which prompt an internal jury trial at the union, are the first step in removing an elected officer at the union. The board later voted to suspend Mr. Rankin, a UAW spokesman said. The UAW's governing body will oversee his Ohio region until the matter is resolved.

Mr. Rankin denied allegations of workplace harassment in a statement provided by his lawyer. ""I look forward to clearing my name and expect to be fully vindicated,"" Mr. Rankin said. He previously said he was cooperating with the investigation.

Mr. Rankin is the latest UAW leader to face expulsion. Representing some 400,000 workers as one of the nation's most prominent unions, the union also is grappling with a yearslong federal investigation into corruption that prosecutors have said could result in federal oversight of the labor union.

The UAW has said it is executing reform efforts and has condemned former leaders charged in the investigation.

An independent lawyer hired earlier this year by the UAW had been probing harassment allegations against Mr. Rankin by two current female UAW staffers, according to people familiar with the inquiry.

Mr. Rankin, who heads the union's most populous region and by extension holds a powerful position on the UAW's governing board, was alleged to have repeatedly made sexually charged remarks that in one instance escalated to a physical threat, the people said.

The UAW was separately reviewing a formal grievance from a group of UAW-represented nurses involving Mr. Rankin that also contains allegations of sexual harassment, people familiar with that complaint say.

The union brought in an attorney from the Washington-based law firm Bredhoff & Kaiser, PLLC in January to conduct an independent investigation into the women's claims, the people said. The UAW's executive board received the report on Friday, according to the UAW statement.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Scammers Try to Cash In on Virus Panic

Danita Sienknecht was on a car ride with her husband one recent morning when a stranger called her with an outlandish offer. If she wired him $4,000 overnight, someone would show up at her door the next morning with two doses of a coveted coronavirus vaccine she knew doesn't exist.

The caller, who knew her name, said he was at a Holiday Inn not far from her southwest Missouri home and told the 84-year-old to send the money right away. He called her 29 more times when she refused to call back.

""I knew I had to report it,"" Ms. Sienknecht said.

Authorities are being flooded with complaints as scammers try to cash in on the nation's panic over the coronavirus by peddling fake cures, soliciting donations to phony charities and selling needed items like masks, hand sanitizer and toilet paper at jacked-up prices.

The Federal Trade Commission said on Monday it had received at least 7,283 complaints of coronavirus-related scams in the first three months of the year, with $4.6 million in reported losses.

""I don't think I have ever been as busy as I have been since early February,"" said Colleen Tressler, a consumer education specialist with the FTC, who has been urging people to pause and consider offers of help or promises of treatment before opening their wallets or clicking unusual links.

The agency, whose mission is to protect people from fraud and deception, so far has sent warning letters to at least seven businesses that authorities said were hawking products that falsely claim to treat coronavirus, such as teas, essential oils and colloidal silver.

A Brooklyn, N.Y., man, Baruch Feldheim, was arrested Monday for allegedly coughing on FBI agents while claiming to have coronavirus as they were investigating his stockpiling and sale of surgical masks, N95 respirators and medical gowns, prosecutors said. They said he sold the items to doctors and nurses, sometimes at a 700% markup. It couldn't be determined if Mr. Feldheim, 43, had a lawyer.

Elsewhere, FBI agents on Monday arrested Erik Santos, 49, in Georgia after he allegedly solicited and received kickbacks from testing companies in exchange for referring people for Covid-19 tests they apparently didn't need and that Medicare would pay for. His lawyer couldn't be reached for comment.

In Michigan, where the state's attorney general has a team of special agents to field price-gouging complaints, authorities said a pair of businesses marketed a patch that they falsely claimed would provide immunity from the virus.

New York's attorney general warned of scammers seeking consumers' bank information by claiming to be able to provide early access to federal stimulus payments -- before President Trump had signed the $2 trillion economic relief plan.

In Southern California, federal prosecutors said actor Keith Middlebrook, 53, told his millions of Instagram followers he had developed a coronavirus prevention pill and injectable cure before he was arrested last week while delivering the bogus drug to an undercover FBI agent.

Court records don't list an attorney for Mr. Middlebrook, who couldn't be reached.

""Scammers are just opportunistic people,"" Ms. Tressler of the FTC said. ""They are going to cast as wide of a net as possible and see who gets caught.""

AARP has received reports of a range of scams, including people receiving text messages falsely claiming to be from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services asking them to click a link to take a ""coronavirus preparedness test"" that instead downloads malware onto their devices, said Kathy Stokes, the organization's director of fraud prevention programs.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: An Early Van Gogh Painting Is Stolen From Dutch Museum

In a brash overnight robbery, thieves stole a painting by Vincent Van Gogh from a Dutch museum that has been closed for the novel coronavirus lockdown, police said.

The painting, ""Parish Garden in Nuenen, Spring,"" was snatched at 3:15 a.m. Monday after burglars smashed a glass door at the Singer Laren Museum in the town of Laren, 18 miles southeast of Amsterdam. It was the only artwork stolen.

Police, alerted by an alarm, arrived to search the area but found no trace of the burglars. A Dutch police spokeswoman said authorities were seeking the help of local residents whose video cameras may have recorded the burglars.

It is unclear whether the pandemic played any direct role in security staffing levels at the Singer Laren.

The 1884 painting, which was on loan from the Dutch Groninger Museum since January, was one of several that Van Gogh madein Nuenen,where he went to live with his parents in the mid-1880s.The oil-on-wooden-panels painting is of the garden at the parsonage where his father served as pastor.

The painting's value isn't known, a spokeswoman for the Groninger museum said.

The general director of the Singer Laren Museum, Evert van Os, said the museum's security system operated entirely according to protocol.

""This protocol, which we have already been following for years, is well-coordinated with our insurance experts,"" he said. ""Of course, we can learn something from this.""

Monday's theft wasn't the first from the museum, whose collection contains art from the1850-1950period, including seven sculptures by France's Auguste Rodin. In 2007, an original of Rodin's statue ""The Thinker"" was among seven bronze items stolen from the museum's sculpture garden. It was recovered two days later, badly damaged.

""Parish Garden in Nuenen, Spring"" was stolen on what would have been Van Gogh's 167th birthday.

The painting's earthen palette and realistic style are characteristic of the artist's early work.

Today, these early works aren't as prized by the marketplace as his later, signature works that feature his boldly colorful, roiling brush strokes, such as his 1889 icon, ""Starry Night.""

The Fed Takes Uncharted Course to Stem Virus Damage --- Jay Powell has moved the Fed faster and farther than ever, transforming its role

By Nick Timiraos

WASHINGTON -- To meet the dislocation the coronavirus pandemic unleashed on the economy, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has mobilized the central bank to move faster and farther than ever before.

In the short weeks since financial markets seized up, Mr. Powell has placed the Fed on wartime footing. He took up the central bank's playbook from the 2008 financial crisis and then some -- cutting rates to near zero, purchasing huge quantities of government debt and, breaking a taboo, lending to American businesses.

The pace left no time for the deliberative policy process the Fed prefers. Officials can spend weeks tweaking a few words in a heavily parsed statement. This time, the team saw the need for immediate action.

When Fed officials met Sunday morning, March 15, infections were rising along the East Coast. Mr. Powell and his colleagues left empty seats in between them at the central bank's oval boardroom table, made of Honduran mahogany and granite. Two screens suspended from the two-story boardroom ceiling showed 12 reserve bank presidents and others who dialed in remotely.

They made decisions in four hours that would usually take two days.

""We learned our lesson. Moving early and aggressively is really important,"" said Patrick Harker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. ""We needed to get the markets functioning.""

It's another transformation of the Fed's traditional role in American finance, as banks' lender of last resort, in a time of crisis. Congress has encouraged the Fed, working with the Treasury Department, to invent new ways to stem the damage, pushing the Fed into policy choices it has long preferred that elected officials decide.

Mr. Powell and his colleagues have rolled out new programs at all hours of the day to keep markets functioning and otherwise-solvent businesses afloat. They are preparing to facilitate lower-cost lending for cities and states. Adding to the challenge, they have done much of this from their homes, as a health precaution, instead of from a Fed war room.

The current situation has no precedent in postwar America. Economic activity has been deliberately halted, the equivalent of a medically induced coma, to slow the virus. That means the Fed, rather than trying to kick-start growth, is instead focused on preventing credit from drying up to preserve the economy's capacity to produce once activity resumes.

The big challenge for the Fed is that so much about the economy's future remains out of its control. If the virus overwhelms the Fed's power to preserve businesses' access to money, the result could be defaults and bankruptcies that turn a severe, synchronized global recession into a full-bore depression.

The Fed's actions appear to have helped core pillars of the financial market to function for now. The danger is that new programs, even those launched very quickly, won't be ready in time to help revenue-starved businesses already burning through cash. Designing new programs also raises fundamental questions about which firms should get help and on what terms.

Many economists now expect the U.S. economy to experience a severe recession. Goldman Sachs economists see it contracting at an annualized rate of 24% during the April-to-June quarter. Morgan Stanley sees the unemployment rate rising to 12.8% this spring -- the highest on records that date to 1948.

The economic outlook is more dire than after the 2008 financial crisis, making it easier for Mr. Powell to cast aside the nagging concerns that his predecessors faced as the housing bubble burst.

Back then, officials were reluctant to cut rates as quickly because they weren't sure how bad the housing bust might get. Some were concerned that untested tools to purchase government debt might fuel excessive inflation. Others worried about the effect near-zero rates would have on markets.

Now, Fed officials have lent freely and purchased enormous amounts of debt, likely swelling its balance sheet to $6 trillion this week from $4.2 trillion in late February.

Officials unveiled six new lending facilities, lending not only to banks, but also to businesses. As part of its rescue package, Congress kicked in $454 billion so that the Fed can take on more risky lending, with programs expected to support trillions of dollars of borrowing.

With credit markets beginning to rally last week, Mr. Powell fielded a phone call from President Trump, who earlier in the month had disparaged the Fed as ""pathetic,"" the latest in a yearlong string of insults over his desire for lower rates, even when the economy was on a stronger footing.

""I said, 'Jerome, good job. You really did it,'"" Mr. Trump recounted later to reporters. ""I was proud of him. That took courage.""

Mr. Powell, who goes by Jay, said little in response.

People who work with Mr. Powell, a 67-year-old lawyer who isn't an economist, say he has carried a calm demeanor throughout. That, they say, reflects his comfort with the team inside the central bank, the relationships he has cultivated across Washington and his experience studying the economy and financial markets during a career in private equity and a stint in the Treasury Department during George H.W. Bush's presidency.

From his home office in the Maryland suburbs, Mr. Powell fields early-morning calls with central-bank counterparts abroad and late-night consultations with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. He relies on a specially configured laptop to access his Bloomberg data terminal, Wall Street's ubiquitous trading-desk tool.

Mr. Powell has made clear that even with interest rates at zero, the Fed's firepower is limitless. ""When it comes to lending, we are not going to run out of ammunition,"" he said Thursday in an interview on NBC's ""Today"" show.

Just as Ben Bernanke, a leading scholar of the Great Depression, was praised by economists and his peers in government for being the right person to lead the Fed during the 2008 crisis, current and former colleagues say Mr. Powell is proving more decisive than more academic-minded colleagues in a job that is becoming more political.

His feel for markets ""is more second nature, and that gives him a greater level of confidence,"" said William Dudley, a former president of the New York Fed who served alongside Mr. Powell for six years. ""If you're not as confident you tend to want to get more evidence before you move. He's responding very aggressively, and that's appropriate.""

When Mr. Powell traveled to Riyadh for a Feb. 22 summit of Group of 20 ministers and central bankers, the virus was tearing through Italy, Iran and South Korea, and markets had started to turn from record highs. Mr. Powell began emailing staff back in Washington that their policy plans would need to change.

U.S. school closures and travel restrictions that would crimp the economy, until then a far-off hypothetical, were quickly becoming a reasonable base case.

By the end of that week, with markets down more than 14% from their highs of one week earlier, Mr. Powell issued a rare statement under his name signaling rate cuts were likely. Fed officials met March 2 to agree to the first emergency rate cut in 12 years.

By March 11, the uncertainty about economic disruptions panicked markets. Financial institutions began selling U.S. government securities, typically considered a haven, to raise cash after markets for corporate debt, mortgage-backed securities and other assets began seizing up.

Mr. Powell concluded the Fed couldn't wait until its regularly scheduled interest-rate policy meeting the following week to act. Fed officials decided to move up the policy meeting by two days to March 15. In between, the Fed accelerated previously planned purchases of Treasury securities in a bid to prevent strains from worsening.

A key ally, Richard Clarida, a monetary economist who became vice chairman in 2018 after serving as a longtime adviser to bond giant Pacific Investment Management Co., dialed in from the New York Fed's lower Manhattan headquarters after driving from his home in Connecticut.

That day, Fed officials received a briefing from Lorie Logan, the manager of the Fed's portfolio.

Ms. Logan ran through the range of distress: market volatility at highs, short-term funding markets seizing up, businesses unable to borrow in debt markets, Wall Street dealers flooded with transactions, hedge funds unwinding bond trades that became unprofitable when volatility soared.

Particularly troubling was a widening gap between the higher prices for Treasury securities that were issued more recently than so-called off-the-run securities issued previously. The Treasury market sits at the foundation of the financial market, providing a backbone for everything from hedging trades to conducting monetary policy, and certain types of deteriorating trading conditions in this normally robust market signaled much bigger cracks forming.

Officials agreed to what were once considered last-resort measures -- the cut in the benchmark rate to near zero and open-ended purchases of Treasury and mortgage securities to bolster confidence and unclog markets. They also encouraged banks to tap the so-called discount window for emergency loans by reducing the rate on those loans to 0.25%, a record low, and by extending terms to 90 days.

The Fed announced its actions at 5 p.m. eastern, before Asian markets opened. But they tumbled. The selloffs moved on to Europe and, when U.S. markets opened, the stress spread to other assets.

Mr. Powell then deployed the rest of Mr. Bernanke's crisis plan. Mr. Bernanke had broken the seal on a little-used but powerful provision -- section 13(3) of the Fed's charter -- that allows the Fed to lend broadly during a crisis. Mr. Powell now kept that section tabbed on his computer screen.

On March 17, the Fed unveiled a program at 10 a.m. to backstop markets for short-term corporate IOUs called commercial paper, and another at 6 p.m. to allow approved dealers of U.S. government debt to borrow against stocks and bonds.

Still, the next day, money-market funds were besieged, unable to easily sell holdings of commercial paper to meet investor demands for cash. At 11:30 p.m., the Fed and Treasury announced a program to backstop prime money-market funds. Late that same evening, the European Central Bank had announced a new debt-purchase program to alleviate rising yields on certain countries' government debt.

""Midnight announcements tell you there was an urgency to put a safety net under the system,"" said Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities.

In the midst of that frenetic week, Mr. Powell started to work from home, as did many other Fed officials.

The financial bleeding spread to the mortgage market, forcing sales of government-backed bonds by real-estate investment trusts. Officials, who had previously said the Fed would buy at least $700 billion in government and mortgage bonds over months, now said it would purchase them within days. It is on track to have bought twice that by the end of this week.

At 8 a.m. Monday, March 23, Fed officials unveiled their latest package: open-ended bond purchases and three new lending facilities for business debt markets.

In moving so aggressively to keep the economy from being overwhelmed by the coronavirus, Mr. Powell has also transformed the Fed's role to being the lender of last resort not only to banks, but to businesses. To fend off criticism the lending favors big business, Mr. Powell is planning a new facility to help smaller firms.

The Fed's task now is to get these programs working quickly. ""We are moving aggressively in our thinking in how we help Main Street,"" said the Philadelphia Fed's Mr. Harker. ""We're all seeing it right now walking around our neighborhoods. These are challenging times.""

Lost at Sea in a Pandemic

During a time when we're afraid to go out, fearful of others as possible Covid-19 carriers, how do we ensure we continue acting in ways consistent with our common human dignity?

Holland America Line is working tirelessly to find medical help and safe passage home for the 1,243 guests and 1,247 crew stranded at sea, cruising north near Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, on two of our ships, Zaandam and Rotterdam. Covid-19 broke out on Zaandam last week. Two hundred people on board have had flulike symptoms, and nine have tested positive. They are among the 9,000-plus passengers still remaining on about a dozen cruise ships world-wide. These are unfortunate souls unwittingly caught up in the fast-changing health, policy and border restrictions that have rapidly swept the globe.

The questions I keep asking myself for guests and crew on these ships are:

-- How will those needing intensive medical treatment receive it with limited shipboard medical staff, facilities and supplies?

-- Nations are reluctant to share provisions or afraid to carry critical supplies out to us. What happens when our supplies run out?

-- Can guests and crew without symptoms get home with limited flights and closed borders?

Even our guests, who come from 35 countries, are questioning: ""My president or prime minister told me to get home. I'm a citizen. How can my government turn me away?""

Nations are justifiably focused on the fast-developing crisis. But they've turned their backs on thousands of people floating at sea. Are these reactions based on facts or fueled by irrational fear? What happened to compassion and helping thy neighbor?

We are dealing with a ""not my problem"" syndrome. The international community, consistently generous and helpful in the face of human suffering, shut itself off to Zaandam, leaving her to fend for herself.

As a result, the crew was forced to take proactive measures, rendezvousing with sister ship Rotterdam to replenish much-needed supplies and protect the health of the guests and crew who aren't ill.

We made the unprecedented decision to transfer to Rotterdam those guests we could quickly and safely move to alleviate Zaandam crew's workload immediately, and to get as many guests as possible into rooms with windows and verandas. Following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention protocols, we screened guests before transfer, and all involved wore protective face masks. To ensure everyone's well-being, we did not move guests who needed further screening or those likely to need continuing support by the medical team. Guests on both ships continue to self-isolate in their staterooms.

Reducing the guest count on Zaandam helps available staff better serve those remaining on board. No guests who have been ill or symptomatic were moved, nor were their close contacts. And no Zaandam crew moved to Rotterdam. Zaandam received additional medical supplies including Covid-19 tests, face masks for guests and personal protective equipment for crew, as well as medical staff. This will help, but patients will need to get home for additional medical care.

It's important to remember that the passengers and crew did nothing wrong. When the voyages began in early March, South and North America had few confirmed Covid-19 cases. The World Health Organization was advising against travel restrictions, and the Americas weren't affected by travel or health advisories. Travel in all forms continued to bustle across the two continents as recently as mid-March -- albeit with more personal-hygiene reminders.

That all changed within days. Local governments swiftly closed ports globally. Ships that had been cleared for docking were abruptly turned away. Officials denied repeated requests for access and assistance. The world shut itself off, leaving ships stranded at sea to make it on their own, which isn't sustainable. As Zandaam approached Florida Monday, Gov. Ron DeSantis insisted that passengers couldn't be ""dumped"" in the state. Eventually someone must allow these ships in.

Holland America Line began actively monitoring Covid-19 in January, working with international health authorities to step up already robust screening, prevention and control procedures to keep guests and crew safe. Then, on March 13, amid growing global health concerns, we announced a 30-day suspension of global cruise operations. On March 30 that suspension was extended an additional 30 days, canceling cruises through May 14.

For ships like Zaandam in the middle of operation -- its two-week South America voyage began in Buenos Aires March 7 -- we quickly sought approval to disembark guests for flights home. Chile announced the closure of its borders on March 16, literally while Zaandam had been sitting in Punta Arenas for two days awaiting clearance for guests to disembark for flights home. Peru closed, as did Argentina and the rest of the ports in South America. Repeated requests for humanitarian consideration were denied.

Then on March 22 -- one day after the voyage's original end date -- a few guests and crew began reporting flulike symptoms. Despite countless desperate pleas in the following days, we were forbidden to medevac critically ill patients to shore-side hospitals -- usually standard operating procedure for comprehensive care that ships aren't equipped to provide.

Already four guests have died. The causes of death haven't been confirmed, as we don't do autopsies on our ships. But I fear other lives are at risk. As of Tuesday, 83 guests and 117 crew on Zaandam have had flulike illness, including the nine who have tested positive for Covid-19. We have seen a notable and steady decline in new cases during the past 48 hours, which shows the immediate actions we took have helped contain spread.

There are also 1,167 healthy guests and 1,130 healthy crew across these two ships.

The Panamanian government graciously granted humanitarian approval allowing both ships to move through the Panama Canal, which they did the evening of March 29. Even with this progress, we still face a multiday journey before we can safely dock and disembark. And we need confirmation from a port that is willing to extend the same compassion and grace that Panama did and allow us to come in so our guests can go straight to the airport for flights home. It's tempting to speculate about the illnesses that might have been avoided or lives saved if we'd gotten the assistance we sought weeks ago.

It's easy to condemn those who are unhelpful and unwelcoming during times of need. But what if we focus instead on the type of society we strive to be, where nations share a collective responsibility to help people in peril? These travelers could have been any of our families, caught up by a fast-changing crisis nobody foresaw.

The Covid-19 pandemic is an urgent test of our common humanity. To slam the door in the face of these people betrays our deepest human values. Given the opportunity, I am hopeful that all of us will follow the lead of our Panamanian friends and help our neighbors.

Mr. Ashford is president of Holland America Line.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held up last week's coronavirus relief bill with demands related to corporate diversity, carbon emissions and election reform. But Democrats are far from finished using the crisis to try to force through partisan priorities they couldn't pass in normal times. Mrs. Pelosi is now hinting the price for further economic relief may include expanding a regressive tax deduction for high-earners in states run by Democrats.

On Monday Mrs. Pelosi told the New York Times she wanted Congress to ""retroactively undo SALT."" In the 2017 tax reform, Republicans limited the state and local tax deduction to $10,000. That raised federal tax revenue mostly from high-tax parts of states like California, New York and New Jersey and helped pay for the rate cuts on corporate, small business and individual incomes. According to the Tax Foundation, the cap raised almost $33 billion in 2018 from those earning more than $1 million per year and had little impact for those earning less than $100,000.

Democrats have been trying to repeal the SALT cap since tax reform passed. They've tried lawsuits, state-level accounting gimmicks and acts of Congress. The last House bill repealing the SALT cap passed in December 2019 but didn't go anywhere in the Republican-controlled Senate. Mrs. Pelosi may be hoping that in an election-year crisis atmosphere the upper chamber would have no choice.

Blowing up the state and local tax deduction would reduce the tax base and increase pressure for higher tax rates. It would also make it easier for poorly governed states to rely on soaking their high earners through capital-gains and income taxes, because the federal deduction would ease the burden.

Both New York and California, for example, tax capital gains at the state income-tax rate on top of the federal rate. Those sources of revenue are the least stable, as both states are likely to discover this year when capital-gains revenue collapses due to the stock-market plunge.

Republican lawmakers have said there are no plans yet for a new relief bill. The $2.2 trillion bill passed last week aims to float the economy for weeks, and no one knows what the public-health situation will look like at the end of April. Yet it's possible there will be pressure for more legislation to bring the economy out of its shutdown-induced coma. If Congress wants to spur growth, then cut marginal rates, which would at least increase the incentive to work and invest.

Mrs. Pelosi's remarks underscore the potential for further political mischief and long-term damage as the government intervenes to stimulate the economy. When Democrats next complain that Republicans want to cut taxes ""for the rich,"" remember that Mrs. Pelosi wants to cut them too -- but mainly for the progressive rich in Democratic states.

A U.S. District Court judge in Boston sentenced a Silicon Valley mother to seven months in prison Tuesday, in the latest punishment handed down to parents charged in the ""Varsity Blues"" college-admissions scandal.

Elizabeth Henriquez pleaded guilty last fall to paying $400,000 to get a daughter into Georgetown University as a phony tennis recruit and to have five college-entrance tests rigged for her and another daughter. The second daughter wound up at Northwestern University.

Her husband, Manuel Henriquez, the founder and now ex-chief executive of specialty finance firm Hercules Capital, has pleaded guilty to participating in the scheme and is set to be sentenced in April.

Judge Nathaniel Gorton said Ms. Henriquez's offense was a crime of ""greed, hubris and flaunting of wealth,"" and said prison was needed not only to deter her but ""anyone else who has the gall to use his or her wealth"" to corrupt the college-admissions system.

Yet the judge also said he was moved by the remorse she showed and believed she would turn her life around.

Ms. Henriquez, 57, who had relinquished a career in finance to be a stay-at-home mother, choked up as she gave a statement to the judge at the unusual proceeding, which was done via videoconference due to the coronavirus pandemic. She said she failed as a mother and ""on a more basic level as a human being,"" and that she mistakenly tried to shield her daughters from failure.

""I did not act in my children's best interest,"" she said, and ""destroyed their lives as they knew them."" She added that she should have let them find their own way, realizing that if they failed, ""that failure would bring them growth.""

Ms. Henriquez was the 16th parent to be sentenced in the scandal, with all but one so far getting prison time, ranging from two weeks to nine months. Six more have pleaded guilty or agreed to do so. Fourteen parents are slated for trials in October and January.

The admitted scheme mastermind, William ""Rick"" Singer, has pleaded guilty to four felonies.

Mr. Singer ran a nationwide scam in which he admitted to taking money from parents to rig SAT and ACT exams or pay bribes to have their children tagged as athletic recruits, all but guaranteeing the teens' admission to college.

Ms. Henriquez's lawyer asked the judge to impose probation and home detention in lieu of incarceration, citing concerns about putting her into the federal prison population during the pandemic.

The judge agreed to delay the start of her prison term until June 30 and to reconsider her request for home detention if the public-health situation has not improved by then. He also imposed a fine of $200,000 and two years of supervised release.

FBI Wiretap Requests Show Persistent Flaws

Secret FBI applications to monitor Americans suspected of having links to foreign intelligence or terrorism contain widespread problems, according to a Justice Department watchdog report that found errors in all the more than two-dozen files reviewed.

The report, which shows issues including sloppy record-keeping by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, indicates the shortcomings aren't limited to those previously found in highly scrutinized requests to surveil Carter Page, a former foreign-policy adviser to President Trump's 2016 campaign. Mr. Page had long been on U.S. counterintelligence officials' radar because of his dealings with Russia, and he became of particular interest because of the probe into links between the Trump campaign and Moscow that the U.S. special counsel determined didn't amount to a criminal conspiracy.

In the report, released Tuesday, the Justice Department's inspector general said he discovered ""apparent errors or inadequately supported facts"" in the files meant to provide factual support for the information cited in the 25 secret applications. Those requests sought wiretapping authority from a special court under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, a law that is the subject of pointed debate in Congress.

The report didn't look at the broader case file for the information cited in the applications, and it said investigators didn't reach any conclusions on whether the errors were material to the applications themselves or would have influenced the court's decisions to approve the applications. The report did say the pattern ""undermines the FBI's ability to achieve its 'scrupulously accurate' standard for FISA applications.""

It said the review had found an average of 20 issues per application, with as many as 65 issues in one, and fewer than five in another.

The findings follow a December report in which the watchdog found errors in the FBI's pursuit of a wiretap against Mr. Page, the former Trump adviser.

Applications were reviewed across eight FBI field offices that involved surveillance on Americans related to counterintelligence or counterterrorism investigations between October 2014 and September 2019, the report said.

FBI officials stressed the agency already was taking steps to improve its surveillance-application process. The ""findings underscore the importance of the more than 40 corrective actions that [FBI Director Chris] Wray ordered late last year,"" the FBI's associate deputy director, Paul Abbate, wrote in response to the new report.

But some privacy advocates said the new findings vindicated their views that problems with FISA are systemic and far broader than the public knows due to a lack of rigorous independent oversight.

""If an application as sensitive as Page's had serious problems, it was highly likely there were going to be issues elsewhere,"" Jake Laperruque, senior counsel at Project on Government Oversight and a former Senate aide who worked on surveillance issues.

In particular, the review found that the FBI hadn't adhered to a set of internal standards, known as the Woods Procedures, that were adopted in 2001 to better safeguard against FISA application abuses. Those procedures -- designed to ensure the accuracy of facts represented in FISA applications -- have long been cited by the FBI to answer concerns of potential privacy abuses in the secretive surveillance system that was established more than 40 years ago.

""We do not have confidence that the FBI has executed its Woods Procedures in compliance with FBI policy,"" the report said.

The report, written by the office of Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, added to concerns about whether adequate privacy safeguards are in place at the FBI to ensure FISA surveillance is carried out appropriately. Mr. Horowitz's previous report from December sparked hearings in Congress and were cited by Mr. Trump as vindication for his view that the investigation of Russian influence in his 2016 presidential campaign was motivated by animus toward him.

Jim Baker, the FBI's former general counsel who helped develop the Woods Procedures, said he read the new report with ""extreme disappointment, anger and frustration"" and said it may reflect a need for the Justice Department to curtail its use of FISA to obtain surveillance unless the attorney general can ensure proper protocols are being scrupulously followed.

""Clearly what Mr. Horowitz found is unacceptable, period, full stop,"" said Mr. Baker, director of national security and cybersecurity at the R Street Institute, a free-market think tank. ""Everyone, including the attorney general, is going to need to dedicate more resources to make sure that this is done properly -- and that may mean less (FISA) coverage.""

A set of intelligence tools not directly related to the FISA wiretap application process expired on March 15. Congress has failed to extend them as competing factions in both parties have either sought to preserve the status quo or open up debate on broad overhauls of FISA, a position that Mr. Trump has advocated despite the recommendations of some of his own advisers.

Lawmakers in both parties said Mr. Horowitz's new findings demonstrated widespread problems. Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he planned to hold a hearing soon on the report.

""Based on the inspector general's audit, the flawed Page case appears to be the tip of the iceberg,"" Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa) said. ""Not a single application from the past five years reviewed by the inspector general was up to snuff. That's alarming and unacceptable.""

Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) said Congress couldn't rely on the FBI and Justice Department alone to implement changes and needed to pass additional FISA transparency and oversight measures into law ""to ensure that every American's rights are protected, not just friends of the president.""

U.S. News: Pandemic Hampers Pending Home Sales

Real-estate agents are rushing to help home buyers and sellers close pending house sales, as the pandemic poses unprecedented obstacles to a high-touch process traditionally done in person.

House hunting usually involves a lot of contact, from the initial tour or open house to the final inspections and appraisal. The official closing is often an in-person meeting with a notary or attorney who oversees document signings.

With the coronavirus pandemic bringing shelter-in-place orders, the real-estate industry has been compelled to find workarounds for every step of this process, often having to navigate local requirements and consumer anxiety.

Home sales are now closing in parking lots where attorneys pass documents through car windows and throw away pens after each use, said Leslie Turner, founding partner at Maison Real Estate in Charleston, S.C.

""Everything's just stopped"" in terms of new business, she said. ""We're just trying to get the properties that we have under contract across the finish line to close.""

While some of the technology to enable remote home closings has existed for years, many real-estate companies are adopting it en masse for the first time.

""This is a business that time forgot,"" said Vishal Garg, chief executive of online mortgage company Better.com. ""It operates literally on paper and fax.""

Some state Realtor associations are recommending addenda for home-purchase contracts that extend closing dates if pending closings are delayed because of the pandemic. Buyers and sellers are also scrambling for alternatives to in-person inspections and appraisals, which are traditionally required for sales and loans to go through.

""It's been a really challenging time,"" said Kelli Griggs, co-founder of Navigate Realty in El Dorado Hills, Calif. ""It's just been a different focus -- rescuing deals versus trying to procure them.""

Pending home sales rose 2.4% in February from a month earlier, the National Association of Realtors said Monday. Pending sales usually predate closings by one or two months, the association said.

Companies that sprang up in recent years to offer remote solutions for home buyers and sellers say they are seeing unprecedented demand.

Notarize, a five-year-old company that enables documents to be notarized online, expects to process at least $100 billion in transactions on its platform this year, up from about $10 billion last year, said Chief Executive Pat Kinsel. ""A lot of our partner industries are in crisis right now because they cannot complete really important transactions,"" he said.

More than 20 states already have laws allowing electronic notarization, and a handful of others, including New York, issued executive orders in March to permit them. A federal bill on electronic notarization was introduced in the Senate in March.

Many notaries, home inspectors and appraisers are self-employed or employed by small businesses. Most of them are still allowed to work, even under various shelter-in-place orders around the country, but many are choosing not to out of health or safety concerns, according to industry groups.

Nick Gromicko, founder of the International Association of Certified Home Inspectors, estimated three-fourths of the 30,000 home inspectors in the U.S. and Canada are unwilling to do inspections right now. ""Financially, it means that it's going to hurt them,"" he said.

Miller Samuel Inc., a New York City appraisal and consulting firm, stopped doing interior appraisals in mid-March, said Chief Executive Jonathan Miller. More lenders are accepting ""drive-by"" appraisals based on exterior inspections or ""desktop"" appraisals based on tax records and other documents, he said.

As more companies enable remote closings, real-estate executives said the increased use of technology in the closing process could become permanent for consumers who prefer the convenience.

Darry Dykstra used electronic notarization in late March to remotely close on the sale of an investment home in Plant City, Fla. ""It was pretty much a no-brainer,"" he said. ""Even without the coronavirus, I don't see me going to the closing table anymore.""

World News: Relatives Fear for Jailed Executives

CARACAS, Venezuela -- Maria Elena Cardenas thought things couldn't get any worse after her husband, an American oil executive, was locked up in a crowded Venezuelan prison on what the U.S. government says are trumped-up corruption charges.

During his many months behind bars, Ms. Cardenas's husband, Gustavo Cardenas, became frail and weak from meager food rations, she said. Her family in Houston has struggled to make ends meet after losing its only breadwinner.

Now, Ms. Cardenas and advocates for prisoners held in the regime's jails fear the new coronavirus will ripple through the densely packed Helicoide, a notorious detention center that holds political prisoners, among them Mr. Cardenas and five other oil executives arrested in November 2017. The six executives at Citgo, the U.S. refinery of state-oil company Petroleos de Venezuela SA, were accused of embezzlement and money laundering tied to a proposed $4 billion financing deal that was never executed.

The men, who maintain their innocence, have yet to receive a trial.

Venezuelans are bracing for an onslaught from the coronavirus. Medical professionals here say the collapsed health system will be unable to attend to citizen needs, let alone those in prison.

""I'm extremely worried,"" Ms. Cardenas said from Houston. The prison, her husband has told her, doesn't give inmates regular access to running water. ""How do you combat a virus without water to wash your hands and everything else? It's like a death sentence.""

The Trump administration, citing the coronavirus threat, has called on President Nicolas Maduro's autocratic regime to release the six men, known as the Citgo Six. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on March 19 that the men -- five of whom are naturalized U.S. citizens and one a U.S. resident -- face ""a grave health risk if they become infected"" because of their weakened immune systems from their lengthy detention.

""They have already spent more than two years in jail without an ounce of evidence being brought against them,"" Mr. Pompeo said. ""It is time to release them on humanitarian grounds.""

Venezuela's Information Ministry didn't respond to requests to comment.

Human-rights advocates and infectious-disease specialists warn that an outbreak of the virus could ravage Venezuela's overcrowded prisons, affecting hundreds of political prisoners. With Venezuela on lockdown, authorities have barred relatives and lawyers from visiting inmates.

""I pray to God every night that the coronavirus doesn't reach Venezuelan prisons,"" said Carolina Giron, a lawyer in Caracas who directs Venezuela's Prison Observatory, which advocates the rights of inmates. ""Everyone will be infected.""

Some families of the U.S. oil executives hope that Caracas will free their fathers and husbands soon, pointing to Iran's recent release of an American detainee for a medical furlough on coronavirus fears.

Others worry it will be harder to win their release amid deepening tensions between Caracas and Washington, believing the men are political pawns of a Venezuelan regime that the United Nations has accused of carrying out extrajudicial killings, locking up political opponents and using scarce food for political control.

On Thursday, U.S. prosecutors charged Mr. Maduro with drug trafficking and offered a $15 million reward for his arrest. Venezuela's attorney general, Tareck William Saab, responded by opening an investigation against the U.S.-backed opposition leader, Juan Guaido, on accusations of organizing a coup. The Venezuelan opposition last year took control of Citgo with the Trump administration's help as part of a failed effort to topple Mr. Maduro.

""I'm concerned there are going to be reprisals and this will complicate the situation even more,"" said Jesus Loreto, the Caracas lawyer for Tomeu Vadell, one of the executives.

A spokesman for the State Department said the U.S. is ""continuously pressing"" the Venezuelan government to release the men.

Not too long ago, Ms. Cardenas got a phone call from her husband. In a two-minute conversation, he said the inmates were trying to keep their cells clean to avoid infection. He said he would soon be home. Ms. Cardenas isn't so hopeful. ""I don't understand why there is so much evil, what's the sense of it all?"" she said. ""This has changed our lives forever.""

Data Breach at Marriott Is the Third in 18 Months

Marriott International Inc. is investigating a data breach that exposed up to 5.2 million customers' personal information, at least the third cyber incident for the hotel giant in the past 18 months.

The company said on its website Tuesday that some guests' names, addresses, birthdays, emails, phone numbers and loyalty reward program numbers for both the hotel chain and partner airlines could be compromised. It added that it ""currently has no reason to believe"" that more sensitive information like passwords, passport information or driver's license numbers were affected.

The news comes at a devastating moment for Marriott and the broader tourism industry. The Bethesda, Md., firm -- the world's largest hotel company -- has furloughed thousands of employees in response to the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.

How the breach transpired is unclear. The data was accessed using login credentials of two employees of a franchised hotel in Russia, spokesman Brendan McManus said. He didn't say whether the employees are suspected of foul play or if their accounts were compromised.

""Our investigation is ongoing, and it is too premature to comment on that,"" Mr. McManus said.

Marriott said it noticed an unusual amount of guest data accessed through an in-house app used to track customers' check-in dates, birthday celebrations and towel preferences.

While company officials say they first noticed the uptick in activity in late February, they believe it began in mid-January.

The breach Marriott reported Tuesday is at least its third in the past 18 months. In a letter to the California attorney general in October, the hotel chain said unknown attackers gained access to at least 1,552 company employees' names, addresses and Social Security numbers through a former vendor that handled official documents such as court orders and subpoenas.

Mr. McManus declined to comment on that breach.

A year earlier, the company revealed a massive hack of the reservation database for its Starwood properties that exposed more than 300 million guests' data, including sensitive information like passport numbers, payment cards and travel details.

Marriott has since faced a class-action lawsuit over the breach, believed to be one of the largest in history.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Federal Prisoners To Be Locked Down

The federal Bureau of Prisons said Tuesday that it would keep thousands of inmates at facilities nationwide locked in their cells with limited exceptions for the next 14 days as officials try to stem the spread of the coronavirus after one prisoner died and more prisoners and staff tested positive for the disease.

Prison officials stopped short of calling the rare move a lockdown but said inmates would only be allowed out in small groups for things such as showers, commissary and phone calls.

The bureau will also be restricting the number of inmates being transferred between its facilities as part of the plan, which came after concerns were raised by lawmakers, corrections officers and inmates that officials weren't being aggressive enough in their response to the pandemic.

At least 28 inmates and 24 staffers throughout the federal prison system had tested positive for Covid-19 as of Tuesday morning, the bureau said. Union officials said those numbers are likely much higher, given the virus's ability to quickly spread.

The decision came amid escalating concern that inmate transfers between facilities could heighten the risk of an outbreak.

Earlier this week, prisoners were still being moved, sometimes by bus or plane, across the country.

The bureau said it would still have to shuttle some prisoners around for court cases and other legal proceedings, health reasons and to manage bedspace and overcrowding, but that it was working with the U.S. Marshal's Service to further limit such travel.

The new restrictions were rare; the last time the federal prison system was on total lockdown was after a series of riots in 1995. Prisons officials said this was different because it wasn't punitive and inmates would still have access to programs and services that are normally offered, such as mental health treatment and education.

Concerns about an outbreak escalated after the death of the first federal inmate from the coronavirus on Saturday. Patrick Jones, 49 years old, was held at a low-security facility in Oakdale, La., where at least nine inmates and eight staff had tested positive for the virus as of Tuesday, with others in isolation or hospitalized for their symptoms, according to a count from prison union leaders. At least 16 employees at the facility are awaiting test results.

""If it gets in here, it's going to spread like wildfire,"" said Benjamin Freedland, 37, an inmate who was being held in an area with about 120 others at a federal transfer center in Oklahoma.

He spoke by phone before the new measures were imposed. Newly arriving inmates had their temperature taken and were being placed in quarantine as part of a policy that aims to limit exposure. But Mr. Freedland said officers monitoring them continued to move about the prison and too few of them have masks.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Guatemala Asks U.S. to Halt Deportations of Its Citizens

Guatemala's government has asked the U.S. to stop all deportations of Guatemalans to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in the impoverished Central American country, days after local authorities reported the first case of an infected deportee, a senior Guatemalan official said.

Guatemala fears deportations from the U.S. could be a major source of infection in the country, the official said. U.S. authorities deported some 54,900 undocumented Guatemalans in fiscal year 2019, the largest number for a Central American country.

""We have asked in the kindest terms, knowing that we are friends and allies, to stop deportations during this crisis to not make things worse,"" the official said, adding that negotiations are continuing and the U.S. has yet to respond to the request.

A U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman said deportation flights to Central America are ongoing.

Guatemala has been in talks with the U.S. about the flights of deportees since Saturday night, said foreign ministry spokesman Joaquin Samayoa. Discussions began after a 29-year-old deportee known as patient 36 arrived in Guatemala City on a flight from Mesa, Ariz., on Thursday with another 40 deportees.

The man showed no symptoms upon arrival, but two days later he became ill and tested positive. He has been hospitalized while his fellow passengers on the flight have been self-quarantined in their homes, and are being checked by health ministry officials, said Ana Lucia Gudiel, the ministry's spokeswoman.

The U.S. government has been pressuring Guatemala to continue to allow deportation flights, and has similarly pressed the governments of Mexico, Honduras and El Salvador. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has used deportation planes to bring hundreds of Americans stranded in Latin America back to the U.S.

The Trump administration is facing pressure from U.S. lawmakers and advocates to release immigrants from civil detention centers, and courts have ordered the release of some people with underlying medical conditions.

Guatemalan officials say the flow of migrants to the U.S. has slowed, and many migrants want to return home as coronavirus cases spread in the U.S.

""We are involved in telling the migrant population that they should not listen to human smugglers who offer to take them to the U.S. because the U.S. is in lockdown,"" said Mr. Samayoa.

The coronavirus pandemic threatens some Trump administration actions regarding migrants. An asylum agreement with Guatemala to receive asylum seekers from third countries has been temporarily suspended, Guatemala's government said two weeks ago. Similar deals with El Salvador and Honduras haven't yet been implemented and experts say they will likely be postponed because of the pandemic.

Guatemala, Central America's most populous country with 17 million people, closed its borders to all foreigners except diplomatic personnel on March 17. It has reported 38 positive cases of coronavirus and one death.

Honduras and tiny El Salvador, which along with Guatemala form part of the so-called Northern Triangle, reported 141 and 32 positive cases, with nine deaths in Honduras and none in El Salvador so far, government data show.

El Salvador closed its international airport in the capital for commercial flights, but deportation flights from the U.S. have kept coming, an immigration official said. In Honduras, which has closed its border, flights of deported Hondurans have continued, said an activist who works on receiving deportees.

On Tuesday night, the Department of Homeland Security notified Congress that more than 500 additional military troops were heading to the border with Mexico to provide ""enhanced detection and monitoring"" for the coronavirus.

The number of Guatemalans deported from the U.S. has plummeted in recent days due to increased health controls in the U.S. and Guatemala, said Mr. Samayoa.

Guatemala has put in place a 4 p.m. to 4 a.m. curfew, which includes most transportation, and effectively limits the time during the day that deportee flights can land.

U.S. News: Fed Acts to Reduce Currency Strains

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve said Tuesday that it would launch a temporary lending facility that for the first time would allow foreign central banks to convert their holdings of Treasury securities into dollars, its latest bid to alleviate strains in global markets.

The program is designed to alleviate stresses in currency markets that had prompted more foreign central banks to sell their holdings of Treasurys. The Fed has been aggressively purchasing Treasury and mortgage securities to reduce market strains, and the latest move could reduce the supply of those securities hitting the market if foreign central banks can more easily exchange them for dollars.

The program could allow about 170 foreign central banks and other international monetary authorities that maintain accounts at the New York Fed and aren't subject to U.S. sanctions to enter a lending arrangement called a repurchase agreement, or repo, in which borrowers temporarily exchange their Treasury securities for dollars.

""This facility should help support the smooth functioning of the U.S. Treasury market by providing an alternative temporary source U.S. dollars other than sales of securities in the open market,"" the Fed said.

The repo facility for foreign central banks will be available beginning April 6 for at least six months.

The latest dollar-lending programs will complement separate tools the Fed has launched to lend dollars to 14 other central banks in Europe, Canada, Mexico, Japan, Brazil and Australia to ensure markets don't run short of currency outside of the U.S.

Many business transactions abroad take place in dollars and foreign institutions also lend in the currency. The Fed used these ""swap"" lines aggressively in 2008 and 2009 during the financial crisis.

But the latest lending program goes beyond what the Fed employed during the financial crisis or the 2011-12 eurozone crisis by making available dollar funding to a far broader cohort of emerging-market reserve banks. It underscores the growing primacy of the dollar in global finance and the demands that has placed on the Fed to serve as a central bank to the world.

The new lending facility is likely to reach a much broader set of foreign central banks.

Yes, Flatten the Curve

Out of every major crisis comes a saying. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 -- now 9/11 -- it was ""This changes everything."" During World War II the British said, ""Keep Calm and Carry On"" -- good advice then and now. For the coronavirus pandemic of 2020, it looks like America's version will be ""Flatten the curve.""

Given what we're up against, ""flatten the curve"" sounds like a useful rule of thumb -- not only for the health-care system but for the economy, politics and even our social and psychological well-being.

It is appropriate that in an era dominated by technology, with much of life ordered by abstruse code running in the background, the crisis of our era should be defined by the arcane world of statistical epidemiology. Thus, flatten the curve: Rather than endure a crushing, immediate spike of Covid-19 cases, take extraordinary measures, such as social distancing across entire cities, to turn the crisis into a problem that allows mere mortals to cope.

Flattening the curve is not a solution. The coronavirus itself is what needs a solution, such as a vaccine or antiviral therapies. The implicit idea inside ""flattening the curve"" is that the virus's spread will impose significant, immediate costs across society, and dealing with that also requires a strategy.

The epidemiologists' strategy of social distancing is derived from measures taken during the 1918 flu epidemic, which only epidemiological historians remember. For the rest of us who still have historical memory (nonexistent on Florida's spring-break beaches), the more useful, imperfect analogy is the sacrifices and hard choices of World War II.

The U.S. economy did not ""shut down"" then. But it was a crisis. Millions of young men -- sons and fathers -- went to Europe or the Pacific theater for four years, leaving women and older men to adapt. Which they did.

The subject has been understandably raised now whether the economic cost this time, or sacrifice, of business and school closures is worth the goal of flattening the curve of pressure on the U.S. hospital system, or for those likely to contract the virus and be killed or damaged by it.

This reminds me of the familiar debate, or dilemma, over the fact that most of the U.S. health-care system's spending, particularly for Medicare, is on people in the ""final years"" of life. As a baseline in any of these discussions, I don't like the idea of messing with the instinct of doctors and nurses, dating to Hippocrates, to save lives. Revise that instinct downward, and we're undone.

Triage is obviously a legitimate concept in crises. But if we demote the medical profession's instinct to save, for example by accepting X number of deaths while the rest of the population self-immunizes as it goes about its daily routines, we're on a slippery slope. Legalizing euthanasia has already become more socially internalized than it should be.

While the medical troops fight the virus in the trenches, the rest of us need to flatten the coping curves inside our own responsibilities. The politicians always say Americans are up to the task of this or that challenge, but here optimism falters.

How long and to what degree social distancing in the U.S. should continue -- two weeks, eight weeks, six months -- is a subject that deserves analysis at least equal to what medical science is bringing to bear on the virus. So far, we have mostly the madness of crowds.

The financial markets are in an unrestrained and undisciplined panic. Whenever this happens, whether in 1929 or 2008, an overreaction of economically damaging regulation follows. If that post-panic panic occurs this time, it will turn the sacrifices everyone made fighting the virus into a long-term economic decline. The goal should be to create incentives for the economy to turn upward, not drive it down further with new burdens.

Again, it's hard to be optimistic. Even as medical professionals in hazmat suits focus on mitigating infection, Washington addresses financial panic with its own panic. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, in concert with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, wants to throw a trillion dollars into the country. Meanwhile local officials in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco are talking about releasing prisoners. And this even as an estimated 200,000 mom-and-pop stores in New York have voluntarily closed. Who's going to release them?

Here's a recovery idea Bernie Sanders won't like, but what Bernie represents is looking pretty yesterday by now. Before this crisis, the real economy and the people who do real work were strong. When it's over, every level of government -- federal, state and local -- should declare a two-year holiday from regulatory costs, such as the minimum wage. Ask any big-city shopkeeper or business owner if that relief wouldn't help them hire back staff and turn the curve up quickly. Ask the laid-off workers if they'd take that deal.

The heroes of 9/11 were cops and firemen. The heroes of the pandemic of 2020 will be hospital workers. Miracles aren't much in fashion, but if politicians took real risks to free the economy after the crisis, someone might even call them heroes.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: IRS Gives Details on Deferring Payments

WASHINGTON -- The Internal Revenue Service began providing details for taxpayers to defer their April 15 payments to July 15, offering relief to people who owe income taxes for 2019 or estimated income taxes for the first quarter of 2020.

The official notice follows President Trump's national-emergency declaration over the coronavirus outbreak and invokes powers usually used locally after natural disasters. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the move would delay about $300 billion in payments. The new IRS rules waive interest and penalties that normally would apply.

However, the IRS isn't changing the requirement that people file a tax return or seek a six-month extension by April 15. And the rules don't apply to other taxes, such as estate taxes, excise taxes and payroll taxes that aren't handled as part of self-employment income on individual tax returns.

That approach -- which will still require taxpayers to file something by April 15 -- was already frustrating tax preparers, who are preparing for a frantic month and calling on the government to delay the deadline altogether.

""That's a tremendous waste of time to do that,"" said Bob Caplan of Caplan & Wong CPAs LLP in San Mateo, Calif.

The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants called on the Treasury Department to go further. The group's president and CEO, Barry Melancon, said he understands the government's interest in making sure people get refunds they are owed, but said it was impossible for tax preparers to do their job now.

IRS officials haven't explained why they didn't move the filing deadline too.

An earthquake shook Utah awake Wednesday morning, knocking out power and damaging infrastructure while the state was already hunkered down to slow the spread of coronavirus.

The 5.7-magnitude temblor, the largest in Utah since 1992, struck about 10 miles west of downtown Salt Lake City just after 7 a.m. More than a dozen aftershocks followed the quake.

Salt Lake City International Airport, the state's main hub of air travel, was closed Wednesday morning. The FAA air-control tower was evacuated, as were all terminals. The main damage was a broken water pipe, a spokeswoman said, and airport officials were getting it operational again by the afternoon.

Tens of thousands of people in the Salt Lake Valley lost power Wednesday morning, according to Rocky Mountain Power.

""We currently are assessing damages and will restore power as soon as possible,"" the company said on Twitter.

On social media, residents posted photos and videos of their homes shaking and items falling from shelves. The Salt Lake Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, an icon of the city's downtown, sustained minor damage, according to church officials.

The earthquake came just as the state was stepping up its efforts to combat the spread of coronavirus. Utah's first community-spread case of the virus was confirmed last weekend.

All bars and restaurants were ordered to close, except for takeout and delivery, at midnight on Tuesday.

Following the earthquake, Gov. Gary Herbert urged residents to do what public officials had already been telling them to do in response to the spread of coronavirus: Stay home.

""Please stay away from the downtown area while crews assess damage,"" Mr. Herbert wrote on Twitter. ""Unless you work in public safety, or are an essential employee, remain at home or telework.""

Revenue Woes Put Tax Boost On Table

The new coronavirus has upended New York state's normal methods of making laws and passing the state budget, and it has given new life to the argument that the state needs to raise taxes.

Unions and progressive groups already had been calling for higher taxes on the wealthy to help cover the state's existing $6.1 billion budget deficit and raise more funds for housing, school aid and health care.

State Sen. Liz Krueger, a Democrat from Manhattan who chairs the chamber's finance committee, said in an interview that the potential for higher unemployment helped make the case.

""I don't know that it was on everybody's table three weeks ago, but I think it's on everybody's table to think about now,"" Ms. Krueger said.

State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli said Tuesday the amount of projected revenue could fall short of lawmakers' expectations by as much as $7 billion. In January, Gov. Andrew Cuomo proposed a $178 billion budget.

Republican lawmakers said they oppose tax increases, especially as businesses suffer losses from the coronavirus outbreak. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said Wednesday: ""You have businesses closing, you have people out of work. I don't think now is the time to tell people we're going to raise your taxes.""

Democrats control both the state Assembly and Senate. On Wednesday, leaders in both chambers said they were looking to the federal government for relief but that tax increases were possible.

""We've always been willing to consider revenue,"" said Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Democrat from Yonkers. ""It certainly is not my first priority, but we want to consider revenues wherever we can. But our circumstance at this point is becoming certainly bigger than us, so our national partners are going to be more important than ever.""

The state faces a March 31 deadline to adopt a budget. Normally each legislative house would develop and pass its own spending plan, but this year that procedure is being scrapped.

The state Assembly and Senate passed a bill Wednesday that guaranteed 14 days of paid leave to workers required to quarantine because of the outbreak. Mr. Cuomo said he would sign the measure.

The bill had bipartisan support, even though most lawmakers weren't present in the chamber to cast their ballots. Just five of the 63 senators were on the floor; Republican and Democratic leaders agreed to let members record their votes with the Senate clerk from their offices. The 150 members of the state Assembly were only allowed on the floor in groups of 12.

The Capitol closed to visitors on Sunday. Hallways that normally teem with lobbyists were empty on Wednesday.

Ms. Stewart-Cousins said she would be in Albany to negotiate details of the budget with Mr. Cuomo and Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, a Democrat from the Bronx. The three met privately on Wednesday afternoon.

Ms. Stewart-Cousins said senators would disperse, but be ""on standby."" Mr. Heastie said he wasn't sure when members would return.

""This is uncharted territory,"" Mr. Heastie said.

Most of the state's deficit was caused by a $4 billion overrun in its Medicaid program, which provides health care to more than six million New Yorkers. Mr. Cuomo convened a task force to find $2.5 billion in ongoing savings within the program.

A coronavirus relief bill that passed Congress would bring more than $6 billion in additional annual Medicaid funding to New York, U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer said this week.

But Mr. Cuomo said this week that language in the federal bill would prevent his task force from making changes, and therefore ""negates my ability to do a budget.""

World News: Man Convicted of Killing Journal Reporter Awaits Appeal

KARACHI, Pakistan -- A Pakistani court is weighing the appeal of a British national convicted and sentenced to death nearly 18 years ago in the murder of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl, lawyers involved in the proceedings said.

The tribunal in Karachi heard arguments earlier this month in the case of Omar Saeed Sheikh, who received death sentences in 2002 for convictions on three separate crimes -- kidnapping for ransom, murder and terrorism. It could issue a ruling in the next few weeks, the lawyers said. Any decision could then be appealed to Pakistan's Supreme Court.

Mr. Pearl, the Journal's South Asia bureau chief, was killed while reporting on Islamic extremist circles in Pakistan in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the U.S. and the subsequent U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in pursuit of Osama bin Laden and his al Qaeda network. He was abducted on Jan. 23, 2002, and beheaded days later.

Mr. Sheikh, who had communicated with Mr. Pearl for a couple of weeks before his abduction, was arrested and found guilty by a Pakistanianti terrorism court.

Three alleged accomplices were given life sentences. Their appeals were also heard this month.

In the hearing in March, Mr. Sheikh and his accused accomplices sought to have the convictions overturned based on flaws their lawyers say exist with the evidence, said Rai Bashir Ahmed, a lawyer for one of the accused in the recent proceedings and also a defense lawyer in the 2002 trial.

Prosecutors rebutted those arguments and said Mr. Sheikh's death sentences should be upheld, lawyers said. Prosecutors also argued for death sentences in the cases of the convicted accomplices.

Mr. Sheikh's lawyer, Mahmood Sheikh, declined to comment. Lawyers for the other defendants said their clients are innocent.

According to testimony in Mr. Sheikh's 2002 trial, Mr. Sheikh met Mr. Pearl and promised to introduce him to a religious leader he wanted to meet. Later, Mr. Sheikh, who used a pseudonym in his interactions with Mr. Pearl, called the journalist to Karachi to see the cleric there, according to the court's findings.

After Mr. Pearl stepped out of his taxi at a restaurant where he was told to meet, he was put into a car in which Mr. Sheikh was seated, according to the court's findings. The reporter then disappeared, according to testimony at the trial.

The court found that ransom demands were emailed by Mr. Sheikh and his accomplices, demanding better treatment for prisoners held by the U.S. at Guantanamo Bay prison camp and for Pakistan to receive some U.S. jet fighters, in return for letting Mr. Pearl go.

In July 2002, the Pakistani court convicted Mr. Sheikh of orchestrating the plot, ruling he be hanged. Soon after, Mr. Sheikh lodged his appeal.

Mr. Sheikh's parents immigrated from Pakistan to the U.K., where he largely grew up. He later returned to South Asia, where he linked up with Pakistani militant groups, according to Pakistani officials. He was jailed in India in 1994 for helping to kidnap a group of Western tourists in the Indian-controlled part of the disputed Kashmir region. He was released in 1999 by India as part of negotiations with Pakistani militants who had hijacked an Indian plane.

U.S. officials believe that Mr. Pearl's abduction drew the attention of al Qaeda's operations chief, a Pakistani, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who was also the chief planner of the Sept. 11 attacks. Mr. Mohammed was captured in Pakistan in 2003 and transferred to Guantanamo.

There, Mr. Mohammed -- subjected more than 180 times to an interrogation technique known as ""waterboarding"" that human-rights groups regard as torture -- confessed in 2007 to killing Mr. Pearl, according to documents released by the U.S.

Mr. Mohammed is due to stand trial next year for his alleged involvement in the Sept. 11 attacks. He hasn't been charged with any crimes related to the killing of Mr. Pearl. Mr. Mohammed didn't figure in the arguments used in Mr. Sheikh's appeal in Karachi this month, according to lawyers in the case.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: ECB Unveils Surprise Bond-Buying Plan

FRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank unveiled a new 750 billion euro ($818.7 billion) bond-buying program aimed at shielding the eurozone economy from the spreading coronavirus, casting aside longstanding taboos to send a determined signal to investors that the bank will stand behind the region's embattled governments.

The unexpected move, following days of delay and mixed messages from the ECB, underscores the high level of urgency among policy makers in Europe, which has emerged as the new center of the fast-moving global crisis.

Borrowing costs for Southern European countries have jumped in recent days, reflecting concerns that the region's governments might struggle to meet their obligations as spending demands increase. That has revived memories of the eurozone debt crisis nearly a decade ago.

While analysts cheered the ECB's move, it could raise fresh concerns in the region's largest economy, Germany, where officials have long worried about overreach by the ECB.

In a statement, the bank said it would buy 750 billion euros of public- and private-sector assets at least through the end of the year, and possibly beyond. The purchases -- dubbed the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program -- will include Greek government debt, which was excluded under earlier ECB bond-buying programs.

The decision came during an unscheduled late-night conference call among top ECB officials, on a day when borrowing costs for governments like Italy and Spain jumped as the virus roiled and shuttered the region.

""This looks like a game-changer for the euro area economy and markets,"" said Frederik Ducrozet, an economist with Pictet Wealth Management in Geneva.

It means the ECB will be able to buy almost 120 billion euros a month of eurozone debt for the rest of the year -- the largest amount ever. Under the rules of the program, the ECB could focus its purchases in the short-term on Italy and other struggling governments.

""It sends a very, very strong signal to markets,"" said Torsten Slok, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. ""This is the bazooka.""

The decision marks an about-turn for the ECB, which had dragged its feet for weeks about the need for aggressive monetary stimulus, even as major central banks like the Federal Reserve announced deep interest-rate cuts and other actions to help combat the virus.

Last Thursday, ECB President Christine Lagarde stressed at a news conference that the bank was ""not here to close spreads,"" suggesting it wouldn't intervene to narrow the difference in borrowing costs between Germany and Italy.

That comment stunned investors, and the ECB quickly sought to walk it back. The incident called into question the ECB's carefully crafted role as an effective lender of last resort to eurozone governments. The ECB is prohibited under European treaties from financing governments, but European courts have supported its right to use bond purchases to calm markets.

As Italy's sovereign debt came under pressure this week, however, the ECB intervened in the market via the nation's central bank, according to a person familiar with the matter. It also sought to redirect remarks by senior officials suggesting that the bank would take no further action.

""It has intervened in a flexible but intense way due to the volatility of markets,"" the person said.

The ECB declined to comment.

In a confusing twist Wednesday, Austrian central-bank Gov. Robert Holzmann suggested in an interview that investors were right in assuming that the ECB would do little more to support the economy.

He even suggested that a downturn in Europe might have a positive, cleansing effect on the economy by eliminating businesses that aren't viable. ""One should be careful that only the firms capable of surviving do survive, and that others that would have failed even without a crisis don't survive,"" Mr. Holzmann said.

A spokesman for Mr. Holzmann declined to comment further on his remarks, which prompted a swift response from the ECB. The bank said its top officials were united in their desire to use all their tools to support the region's economy.

Still, Italy's 10-year government bond yield rose above 3% on Wednesday for the first time in more than a year, as investors worried that the ECB wouldn't step in to support Rome. The Greek equivalent traded above 4.1%, compared with less than 1% several weeks ago.

""This is the perfect storm,"" said James Athey, an investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. ""Liquidity has essentially evaporated, the BTP [Italian government bond] market has essentially broken today. There are basically no bids and a lot of sellers.""

On a conference call with European Union leaders on Tuesday, Ms. Lagarde said the eurozone economy would likely contract by 1.3% this year if business shutdowns lasted for one month and shrink by around 5% if the shutdowns lasted three months, according to a person familiar with the matter. The latter would represent a fiercer downturn than the financial crisis.

In its statement late Wednesday, the ECB suggested it might alter self-imposed limits on its bond-buying program, breaking a longstanding taboo. That would potentially give the bank room to buy more than a third of the outstanding debt of governments like Italy. It could also raise legal concerns in Germany, where the ECB has faced multiple lawsuits over its bond purchases.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Big Push to Get Aid Out to Americans

WASHINGTON -- Getting lump-sum payments into the hands of every American could take weeks to start and months to complete as the government tries to turn its tax-collection system into a money-distribution machine.

Congress is coalescing around the idea of sending money to individuals to ease the economic disruption from the coronavirus outbreak, and the Treasury Department wants to distribute cash as fast as possible, said Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

A Treasury proposal circulated Wednesday envisions two rounds of payments, one starting April 6 and another starting May 18, with amounts varying by family size and income level. That is beyond the two-week goal Mr. Mnuchin mentioned on Tuesday.

Lawmakers have been talking about $1,000 for each person or more, and Mr. Mnuchin said the government would use Internal Revenue Service information for some people and data from electronic-payment providers for others.

Policy makers face a trade-off between speed and accuracy. The faster the Treasury Department shovels money out the door, the more likely it is that some people will get paid twice and others won't get paid at all. A slower effort could reduce errors, but people who lose jobs or have hours cut would face mounting bills in the meantime.

""A tolerance for error is kind of necessary for this situation,"" said Jack Smalligan, a former Office of Management and Budget official who retired in 2018.

The government last sent payments to Americans in 2008 as the economy was entering a downturn. President George W. Bush signed the law on Feb. 13, but the money didn't start going out until late April. The payments were largely complete by the summer. Then as now, the task was complicated because it occurred during the IRS's busy tax-filing season.

""People are looking at 2008 and saying, 'Wow that was slow,'"" said Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman at the time. ""I'm not saying this just to be defensive of what we did. It was actually pretty quick.""

Then, the government paid up to $600 to each adult and $300 for every child based on formulas tied to income. Many people filed tax returns to claim the benefit, which resulted in extra work for the IRS and millions of inquiries to its call centers.

Since then, the IRS budget repeatedly has been cut in real terms. The tax agency now has about 23% fewer people than it did. The government has since largely dismantled its capacity for mass check-printing, so most payments would be made electronically, said Don Hammond, a former senior Treasury official.

This time around, Congress and the Trump administration are aiming to get the money out quickly. One way to do that would be to divide recipients into several groups for processing. ""This will end up going out in waves,"" said Mr. Smalligan, who is now at the Urban Institute. ""Is the time between those waves weeks or months?""

Depending on how the law is written, the easiest people to pay quickly include those who receive benefits from the Social Security Administration and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The government already sends them money routinely, which means it has accurate bank-account information.

Next are people who file tax returns. More than 80% of taxpayers who get refunds receive them through direct deposit, so the IRS has complete bank-account information and addresses from 2018 tax returns and a partial set of 2019 information. Some of those electronic payments are set to go to tax preparers and then be distributed to individuals, said Dick Gregg, former fiscal assistant secretary at Treasury.

There are potential hitches, however. The older that information gets, the less accurate it is. Some people change bank accounts, resulting in bouncebacks. Others change addresses.

""The IRS right now is probably overwhelmed,"" Mr. Hammond said. ""It's tax filing season. You've got still tax-law changes that are being implemented. And now you've got the effects of the virus on their workforce.""

It would take the IRS time to prepare files that include names and bank account information. Once that information gets to the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, which makes payments, it would take a few days to get to people, said Mr. Gregg.

Targeting payments to some income groups would likely take more time. Another option would be to send checks to everyone and then recoup some or all from top earners when they file their 2020 tax returns. That would make the program a cash grant to middle-income households and a zero-interest loan to those at the top.

""We are trading economic output for health outcomes,"" Mr. Fratto said. ""We have to go big first, and that's the only way it's going to work.""

The hardest group to reach with money is perhaps the most vulnerable: People who don't file tax returns because their income is too low and who don't get other federal benefits. And lawmakers will have to decide if noncitizens should get money, too. That is a challenging and politically explosive question. So is the danger of fraud.

""Any time there's money involved, there's people around who look for opportunities to steal it,"" Mr. Gregg said. ""So you just have to be aware that the faster things get done, it does increase the risk of errors or fraud.""

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
The Emergency 401(k) Button

As the coronavirus threatens to stall the U.S. economy, a relatively easy countermeasure is to hit the emergency 401(k) button: Congress should allow people to take a certain sum, say $10,000, from their retirement accounts without facing penalties or taxes.

This is a way to tap liquidity that already exists. Among nonretired adults, 54% have some kind of defined-contribution plan, such as a 401(k) or 403(b), according to a Federal Reserve report last year. Also, 33% hold an individual retirement account. For Americans overall, it represents a huge pool of money, estimated by one survey at roughly $17 trillion.

Early withdrawals generally face automatic tax withholding. Plus there's a 10% penalty, with narrow exceptions. Congress created a new exception in December when it passed the Secure Act: Up to $5,000 can be taken out, penalty free, ""in case of birth of child or adoption."" In hindsight, lawmakers should have added a provision ""in case of global coronavirus pandemic.""

In the past, Washington has given increased withdrawal flexibility to victims of hurricanes and California's wildfires. What's needed this time is bigger, since the coronavirus pandemic is nationwide and economic idling will affect millions. But the mechanics appear relatively straightforward. Lawmakers could pass legislation saying that early distributions during a defined period won't incur the 10% penalty. Maybe they could waive the usual income tax and withholding, too.

This idea has many advantages, compared with the talk of giving every American a federal check for $1,000 -- or is it up to $2,000? It provides an option for people who need the cash, without blanketing everyone. Under Washington's current plan for a Coronavirus Basic Income, the government would take out debt to pay everyone. Further, each dollar pulled from a retirement account would cost the Treasury only a fraction of that in forgone revenue, for a multiplier effect.

Not everybody has a retirement plan, but a limited period of allowing free-and-clear withdrawals would encourage parents, brothers, uncles and so forth to act as a financial backstop to younger and less-fortunate family. That's a much healthier dynamic than simply telling Americans to sit tight, crank up ""Ride of the Valkyries,"" and wait for the government helicopters dropping $100 bills.

Rethinking the Virus Shutdown

Financial markets paused their slide Thursday, but no one should think this rolling economic calamity is over. If this government-ordered shutdown continues for much more than another week or two, the human cost of job losses and bankruptcies will exceed what most Americans imagine. This won't be popular to read in some quarters, but federal and state officials need to start adjusting their anti-virus strategy now to avoid an economic recession that will dwarf the harm from 2008-2009.

The vast social-distancing project of the last 10 days or so has been necessary and has done much good. Warnings about large gatherings of more than 10 people and limiting access to nursing homes will save lives. The public has received a crucial education in hygiene and disease prevention, and even young people may get the message. With any luck, this behavior change will reduce the coronavirus spread enough that our hospitals won't be overwhelmed with patients. Anthony Fauci, Scott Gottlieb and other disease experts are buying crucial time for government and private industry to marshal resources against the virus.

---

Yet the costs of this national shutdown are growing by the hour, and we don't mean federal spending. We mean a tsunami of economic destruction that will cause tens of millions to lose their jobs as commerce and production simply cease. Many large companies can withstand a few weeks without revenue but that isn't true of millions of small and mid-sized firms.

Even cash-rich businesses operate on a thin margin and can bleed through reserves in a month. First they will lay off employees and then out of necessity they will shut down. Another month like this week and the layoffs will be measured in millions of people.

The deadweight loss in production will be profound and take years to rebuild. In a normal recession the U.S. loses about 5% of national output over the course of a year or so. In this case we may lose that much, or twice as much, in a month.

Our friend Ed Hyman, the Wall Street economist, on Thursday adjusted his estimate for the second quarter to an annual rate loss in GDP of minus-20%. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin's assertion on Fox Business Thursday that the economy will power through all this is happy talk if this continues for much longer.

If GDP seems abstract, consider the human cost. Think about the entrepreneur who has invested his life in his Memphis ribs joint only to see his customers vanish in a week. Or the retail chain of 30 stores that employs hundreds but sees no sales and must shut its doors.

Or the recent graduate with $20,000 in student-loan debt -- taken on with the encouragement of politicians -- who finds herself laid off from her first job. Perhaps she can return home and live with her parents, but what if they're laid off too? How do you measure the human cost of these crushed dreams, lives upended, or mental-health damage that result from the orders of federal and state governments?

Some in the media who don't understand American business say that China managed a comparable shock to its economy and is now beginning to emerge on the other side. Why can't the U.S. do it too? This ignores that the Chinese state owns an enormous stake in that economy and chose to absorb the losses. In the U.S. those losses will be borne by private owners and workers who rely on a functioning private economy. They have no state balance sheet to fall back on.

The politicians in Washington are telling Americans, as they always do, that they are riding to the rescue by writing checks to individuals and offering loans to business. But there is no amount of money that can make up for losses of the magnitude we are facing if this extends for several more weeks. After the first $1 trillion this month, will we have to spend another $1 trillion in April, and another in June?

By the time Treasury's small-business lending program runs through the bureaucratic hoops -- complete with ordering owners that they can't lay off anyone as a price for getting the loan -- millions of businesses will be bankrupt and tens of millions will be jobless.

---

Perhaps we will be lucky, and the human and capitalist genius for innovation will produce a vaccine faster than expected -- or at least treatments that reduce Covid-19 symptoms. But barring that, our leaders and our society will very soon need to shift their virus-fighting strategy to something that is sustainable.

Dr. Fauci has explained this severe lockdown policy as lasting 15 days in its initial term. The national guidance would then be reconsidered depending on the spread of the disease. That should be the moment, if not sooner, to offer new guidance on what might be called phase two of the coronavirus pandemic campaign.

That will surely include strict measures to isolate and protect the most vulnerable -- our elderly and those with underlying medical problems. This should not become a debate over how many lives to sacrifice against how many lost jobs we can tolerate. Substantial social distancing and other measures will have to continue for some time in some form, depending on how our knowledge of the virus and its effects evolves.

But no society can safeguard public health for long at the cost of its overall economic health. Even America's resources to fight a viral plague aren't limitless -- and they will become more limited by the day as individuals lose jobs, businesses close, and American prosperity gives way to poverty. America urgently needs a pandemic strategy that is more economically and socially sustainable than the current national lockdown.

With the coronavirus pandemic pummeling global travel, some hotels are employing a new tactic to boost bookings: targeting guests who face lengthy quarantines.

The risky strategy is a reaction to the challenge that the world's hospitality companies now face, with few people traveling and few likely to do so for some time.

Hotel occupancy rates have plummeted as coronavirus infections have spread throughout the world. In Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea, where cases started climbing early in the global crisis, occupancy rates have fallen from about 70% or higher in January to as low as 20% this month, according to hotel data tracker STR. Hotels in the U.S. and Europe are now suffering a similar fate.

With few tourists visiting Hong Kong, where confirmed coronavirus cases reached 208 on Thursday, hotels are now offering special packages for people who need -- or want -- to quarantine themselves. On Thursday, a new rule took effect requiring all people arriving from abroad to be in quarantine for two weeks. Some individuals who returned to the city in recent days have also opted to self-quarantine and avoid contact with family and friends for a while.

At the Dorsett Wanchai, which describes itself as ""a 4.5 star hotel,"" a reservations employee said the hotel was receiving dozens of inquiries a day about its 14-day quarantine package. For 9,688 Hong Kong dollars (US$1,248), or about $89 per night, guests can book a ""Premier Room"" with a window that can be opened to let in fresh air, an unusual feature for high-rise hotels in the semiautonomous Chinese city.

""Together we fight the pandemic,"" said a recent Chinese-language advertisement for the Dorsett chain that listed 14-day and 27-day package rates for rooms at nine hotels.

The Dorsett Wanchai has designated several floors for quarantined guests, the employee said. Their rooms will be cleaned once a week with disinfectant sprays, with trash bins emptied daily.

Quarantined guests also must undergo temperature checks twice a day to help determine if they might have the virus.

They can order meals from an online food delivery service, whose options include Chinese food, pizza, pasta and Indian cuisine. If they prefer to order from other food outlets, the hotel's concierge will deliver the food to the room, the employee said.

On Wednesday afternoon, three hotel employees were cleaning door handles and windows near its entrance with disinfectant spray. A sign on the check-in desk said guests could get bottles of hand sanitizer refilled.

Most hotels offering quarantine packages normally cater mostly to tour groups or budget travelers and have seen that business largely disappear, said Gloria Chang, executive director at hospitality consulting firm Horwath HTL in Hong Kong.

But some upscale hotels are also getting in on the action. At the Renaissance Hong Kong Harbour View Hotel, a staffer greeting visitors at the front desk Thursday said the hotel had recently begun offering 14-day packages for guests needing to be quarantined. Rates begin at about $160 daily before service and taxes, a discount from standard prices.

Guests must remain in their rooms but are eligible for discounts on food and laundry services.

At the Fairmont Singapore rooms are now available for two weeks for as little as $110 plus tax and service daily. All rooms have balconies. While housekeeping staff cannot enter rooms, fresh towels are left at the door.

Life & Arts -- Television Review: 'Spy Wars': Espionage In the Spotlight

Spy Wars With Damian Lewis

Begins Sunday, 8 p.m., Smithsonian Channel

In 1968, a loyal officer of the KGB is so shaken by the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia that he becomes an operative for British and American intelligence -- one, ""Spy Wars"" reveals (begins Sunday, 8 p.m., Smithsonian Channel), destined to be of historic importance. This is the saga of Oleg Gordievsky -- subject of the first episode of this eight-part weekly series, and a rich portrait it is. When his role of many years as a spy for the British and Americans finally becomes known to the Kremlin, quick exfiltration becomes an urgent necessity. His 1985 getaway in the trunk of a car driven by unflappable MI6 agents, who get him safely to Finland despite suspicious Russian border guards -- and the howls of their alert dogs, who quiet down when the car's driver throws them a treat -- is an escape sequence to cherish.

In 2001, Robert Hanssen -- one of the FBI's most trusted agents -- is unmasked as the mole who had, for 20 years, betrayed the identities of American assets in the Soviet Union and then Russia, thus ensuring their deaths at the hands of execution squads.

In 2010, agents of the Kremlin who had successfully passed themselves off as upstanding American citizens for 10 years are rounded up by the FBI in neighborhoods across the country.

The aforementioned are just three of the exceptionally nuanced case histories presented in ""Spy Wars With Damian Lewis,"" a series distinguished by the eloquence with which it evokes the times in which these events took place. Watching any of the episodes in this series is like being immersed in a hefty work of fiction propelled by complex depths and sharp plot twists, not to mention suspense.

Among them is a chapter devoted to the terrorist plot, conceived in 2006, that was intended to culminate in a loss of American lives equal to that of the 9/11 attacks. The ring leader was Abdullah Ahmed Ali, resident of East London and chief strategist of the group of conspirators planning the destruction of American passenger planes flying from Heathrow to the U.S.

Ali had been given extensive training in counter-intelligence, been taught to avoid being followed and the like -- not that this was of any help to him on this mission. In London, he was successfully followed everywhere he went. For sheer drama, nothing in this history is equal to the surveillance procedure through which MI5 tracked every move made by Ali and others suspected of being his co-conspirators in a planned terror strike of some kind. Thirty agents a day were employed in tracking Ali alone.

A quick secret search of his suitcase at Heathrow had produced an early cause for suspicion -- why was his suitcase stocked with packages for the making of a sugar-based drink and a supply of AA batteries? The answer would be clear, in time. Once the British surveillance team had finished installing hidden cameras and bugs in Ali's East London flat, they had full access to every conversation held there, which is to say they learned most of what they needed to know. Among the things they discovered was that 19 plotters were to take part in the mission -- the same number that were involved in the attacks of 9/11. A fact, one commentator notes, that suggests how much the planners of this terrorist mission wanted to emulate that assault in every way possible, including, above all, its magnitude.

As British intelligence learned, the destruction was intended to be massive and terrifying, the explosives set to go off far enough away from London as to make it impossible for any of the American passenger planes not destroyed to try to make it back to Heathrow. What MI5 didn't know was the day the plot was to be enacted.

There were some complications -- the Americans, the targets of the attack, and the British had differing views as to when the plot should be foiled, the plotters arrested.

None of this mattered in the end, which saw Ali and his chief collaborator arrested and in possession of suicide videos among other pieces of incriminating evidence. A massive arrest action by quickly assembled British police teams swept up all of the other suspected terrorists.

Amid the variety of these case histories, there is the unexpected treasure. That's the story, little known, of the young Mossad agent who leads a mission into enemy territory, starting in 1981, to rescue the Jews of Ethiopia and transport them to Israel, a vividly detailed, emotion-laden account of a perilous flight to the place those rescued considered their homeland.

To the devotees of ""The Americans,"" of course -- some of whom are still waiting to learn whether Martha ever got back from Russia -- no chapter will be as compelling as the one titled ""The Spies Next Door."" Here's the origin story of ""The Americans"" -- the real-life Russian spies who settled in affluent American communities, pretending to be born and bred U.S. citizens. The successful disguise of their identities owed much to their long years of training in a special school where they were drilled in thinking and speaking like Americans -- a place, the film informs us, where even muttering a Russian word in their sleep was cause to be dropped from training.

Here are the Murphys -- Cynthia and Richard of Montclair, N.J. -- who spent 10 years serving the Kremlin while comfortably embedded in a community that thought highly of them. Cynthia especially, who had some big job in finance, it was understood. But she was a fun person, always busy in the garden on weekends. Her husband, Richard, a stay-at-home father, was much more reclusive, a neighbor testifies. Perhaps not surprising -- Richard, it turned out, was in charge of the real family business, which was spying.

Eight chapters, in short, of enthralling power -- a tonic for dark times and every other kind.

MANSION --- Jumbo Jungle: Prepping for Your Refi --- Rates are near historic lows. But before you rush to refinance your home, make sure you have these details nailed down.

In these tough times, a rare silver lining has come in the form of mortgage refinancings -- an effect of the stock-market selloff and flight to safety, which has pulled interest rates lower. Refi applications were up 79% the week ended March 6 compared with the week prior, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Average jumbo loan rates dropped to their lowest levels since 2011, 3.58%, while average conforming loans hit 3.47%, a level not seen since December 2012, the association said.

Where rates are headed is anyone's guess because ""these are unprecedented times and markets are reacting in ways nobody has ever seen,"" said Mat Ishbia, president of United Wholesale Mortgage in Pontiac, Mich. Though historically low 10-year Treasury notes should coincide with plunging mortgage rates, other factors, including investors pulling money out of mortgage-backed securities amid a broad asset selloff, caused rates to tick up last week; then again, the Federal Reserve's rate cut on Sunday might send things lower. Some lenders are so overwhelmed with refi requests that they are slowing the flow of business by raising rates, Mr. Ishbia said.

The dynamic situation requires that borrowers get ready to act fast to lock in rates. While some preparations -- lowering debt levels, improving credit scores and saving up cash -- require lots of planning, unexpected snafus can gum up the works at the last minute. Here's a list of the top five avoidable problems to tackle before you refi.

1. UNFREEZE CREDIT

Once a huge generator of fees for the credit bureaus, a federal law made freezes free -- both to activate and lift -- for consumers in 2018. If you took advantage of this service to protect your credit file from potential fraud, you need to now lift the freeze for the refi. Lenders pull credit files from the big bureaus -- Equifax, Experian and TransUnion -- at the beginning of the process and sometimes again at the end. Use the credit bureaus' online or automated phone systems and request that they unfreeze -- which the bureaus are required by law to do within the hour. However, sometimes consumers aren't able to lift a freeze so easily; instead, they must send a request by fax or snail mail, along with copies of a W2, driver's license or other identification to the credit bureau, said Sathi Roy, head of refinance at Better.com, an online lender. In these cases, once the credit bureaus have received the documents, they have three business days to unfreeze the credit. You can specify the window during which you want a freeze lifted, but it may be safer to permanently lift the freeze; you can refreeze the file when the loan is closed.

2. GET APPRAISAL READY

If you're planning home improvements, either get them done before your lender's appraiser comes to evaluate your home's value, or hold off on repairs until after the visit.

""The house shouldn't be under construction at all,"" said Donald Boucher, president of Boucher & Boucher, a residential appraisal company in Washington, D.C.

While minor repair issues -- the Honey Do list, Mr. Boucher said -- won't swing the appraised value, larger projects might. If, for instance, there is a bathroom renovation under way, the appraiser must either submit an ""as is"" appraisal, which reduces the home value by the amount of work left to be done, or a ""subject to completion"" evaluation, which requires the appraiser to return and confirm the work is done before the loan closes.

Purge clutter and spiff the home up as much as possible.

""You want people who drive up -- even an appraiser -- to say, 'oh, this is a nice house,'"" Mr. Boucher said.

3. CALL YOUR ACCOUNTANT

""Self-employed people will need a year-to-date profit-and-loss statement prepared by their certified public accountant,"" said Alan Rosenbaum, chief executive at GuardHill Financial, an independent mortgage lender in New York. ""This is one of the most time-consuming parts of the process, because it is out of the client's own control,"" he said. The best strategy is to immediately call your accountant and ask for an estimate of how long it will take; that can determine how long a rate lock you need to seek for the refi. While you're at it, ask for digital copies of your last two years of business and personal tax returns -- ""We normally just need federal returns,"" Mr. Rosenbaum said.

4. EXAMINE TRUST DOCUMENTS

If the title of the home is held in a trust, some lenders need a copy of the whole trust while others require specific pages, said Michael Farrell, president of Grandview Lending in Indianapolis, a broker for the Indiana residential market. Make sure you have the trust on hand; a digital copy is even better so that you can upload the required pages and forward them to your broker or lender.

Take a good look at those trust pages and make sure there are no typos -- particularly name misspellings. If there are, the pages will need to be redrafted by the trust attorney and notarized.

5. GO ON A CREDIT DIET

""Do not open a new auto loan, credit card or any new debt during the mortgage process,"" said Bill Banfield, executive vice president of capital markets for Quicken Loans, based in Detroit. New debt causes numerous problems. First, ""it can affect your ability to qualify,"" said Mr. Banfield, if it pushes your debt-to-income balance out of the lender's parameters. But even if it doesn't, it takes time for a lender to look into the new source of debt, verify it and run the debt-to-income calculations again. Make sure you take on new debt before starting the refi process, or even better, after the new loan is closed.

As lenders process a tidal wave of refinancings, they are facing capacity problems, said Michael Fratantoni, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association. In normal times, they would hire and train new staff members and use outside firms to help. These aren't normal times, and closing may take 60 to 90 days rather than the industry standard of 30 to 45. While this can be a negative for a borrower eager to start making lower monthly payments, there is a silver lining to that, too. You'll have more time to resolve snafus.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: ECB Chief, Germany Clash on Aid

FRANKFURT -- As Christine Lagarde races to reassure financial markets she will do whatever it takes to stop the eurozone from unraveling, she is facing internal opposition to the European Central Bank's massive new bond-buying program, a central plank in her strategy to cope with the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.

The 750 billion euro ($799.7 billion) Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program initially placated investors. But the features that helped calm markets -- its scale and flexible buying limits -- could raise concerns among lawyers and politicians, especially in Germany, the eurozone's largest economy, and end up undermining Ms. Lagarde's first big initiative since becoming president of the ECB.

People familiar with the matter said not all of the ECB's 25-member rate-setting committee agreed to the program Ms. Lagarde laid out on Wednesday. At least three senior officials -- the heads of the Austrian, Dutch and German central banks -- raised concerns about its central features, they said.

In the coming months, Ms. Lagarde will have to answer a number of awkward questions, namely: Will the bank lift limits on the types and quantities of securities it will buy? How aggressively will she support Southern European governments, which so far have borne the brunt of the pandemic? And will she encounter fresh resistance from Germany, whose top court is set to rule in May on the legality of the ECB's bond purchases?

The new program ""could become politically contentious down the road as some will see this as hidden monetary financing"" of eurozone governments, which is illegal under European Union treaties, said Oliver Rakau, an economist with Oxford Economics in Frankfurt.

Ms. Lagarde's efforts to help combat the spreading shock of the coronavirus have already suffered from a series of communication errors and mishaps that have pushed up borrowing costs for the region's struggling governments.

Some investors worry the former French finance minister will act less decisively than the ECB president she succeeded in November, the Italian Mario Draghi.

On an emergency teleconference call that started at 7:30 p.m. local time Wednesday, ECB officials all agreed that they needed to do something big, the people familiar with the matter said. Yields on Southern European debt were shooting up toward levels last seen during the region's debt crisis a decade ago, reviving fears about the future of the currency union, as markets fretted over how the region's indebted governments would finance surging costs related to the coronavirus.

Despite the concerns raised by the three central bank chiefs from Austria, the Netherlands and Germany, the ECB agreed to go ahead with the plan put forward by Ms. Lagarde, who previously sought to bridge internal divisions over the bank's broader strategy since taking over as president. The Austrian, Dutch and German central banks declined to comment.

Their concerns, the people familiar with the discussions said, revolved around at least two aspects of the bond-buying program.

The first was its scale, which at 750 billion euros would allow the ECB to buy almost 120 billion euros a month of eurozone government and corporate debt this year, the highest sum ever. Some officials would rather have seen a lower amount, the people said.

Some officials also raised concerns on the call about the ECB's suggestion that it could change its usual self-imposed limits on bond purchases to give it more room for maneuver. Normally, the ECB is restricted to buying only a third of any government's debt. The limit, a longstanding safeguard, is backed by the European courts.

In addition, the new program gives the ECB more flexibility to focus on buying the debt of Southern European governments, softening requirements that it only buy bonds in proportion to the size of each eurozone economy. That is likely to raise hackles in Germany, where top officials regularly berate the ECB for bond purchases they view as subsidizing spendthrift governments.

Still, Ms. Lagarde's plan is a shift after financial markets were disappointed last week with her initial 120 billion euro bond-buying program to support eurozone economies.

""At least the ECB is getting into a ballpark which is more meaningful,"" said Nick Kounis, an analyst with ABN Amro in Amsterdam.

He estimates that 750 billion euros is roughly double the amount of new spending that eurozone governments might be expected to make this year to fight the virus, and could add around 0.5% to the region's gross domestic product.

MANSION --- Private Properties: The Bomb-Proof Estate That Hosted a Prince

A Los Angeles estate with a colorful history -- it was built in the Cold War to withstand an atomic bomb, and was later the subject of a legal squabble involving the late pop star Prince -- is coming on the market for $29.995 million.

Near West Hollywood, the eclectic compound comprises an 18,000-square-foot contemporary house with 10 bedrooms, a 3,300-square-foot English Tudor-style home and two vacant parcels. Altogether, the property is about 2.2 acres.

The main home was built in the 1950s by Hal B. Hayes, who according to numerous reports was a wealthy Hollywood contractor and a notorious playboy. He designed an underground atomic bomb shelter that could be accessed only by diving into the pool and swimming through a short tunnel; Mr. Hayes believed the pool water would serve as a decontaminant, according to the book ""California Design 1930-1965"" by Wendy Kaplan.

Listing agent Jason Oppenheim of the Oppenheim Group said he believes the sanctuary is still there, although he believes no one has gone to check on it in recent years.

The home was built with a fluted design to resist shock waves and a Gunite fireproof surface, according to 1953 profile by Popular Mechanics. Outside, a car was permanently installed to serve as a bar. The car is no longer there.

More recently, the house was in the news for its connection to the late pop star Prince, who was renting the property from then-owner and NBA player Carlos Boozer. In 2006, Mr. Boozer sued Prince in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleging the star had redecorated the home without his consent and, in particular, painted the Prince symbol and purple stripes on its exterior. The lawsuit was later dismissed, records show. Prince had been renting the home for around $70,000 a month, according to the suit.

Today, the home is dated in style but in good condition. The property is also a potential development opportunity since it includes so much vacant land, said Mr. Oppenheim. There is a long gated driveway, a ballroom with a stripper pole, a wine room, a tennis court, a gym and a four-car garage. The pool has a swim-up bar and grotto.

The current owner is a limited liability company tied to the Omidi family, records show. Julian Omidi is set to stand trial in October on charges stemming from a GET THIN's Lap-Band surgery scheme, according to a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in the Central District of California. His mother Cindy was convicted in 2014 of violating laws designed to prevent money laundering and was sentenced to probation, the spokesman confirmed.

William Welden, Ms. Omidi's attorney, said the property is owned by a company tied to her, and Julian Omidi has no interest in the property. He added that Ms. Omidi was not convicted of money laundering; her conviction was based on a technical structuring statute.

Julian Omidi denied the charges against him, saying they are based on a documented false and coerced confession by federal agents who had automatic weapons. He said the confession was drawn from a single witness and said the government is attempting to frame him.

Mr. Oppenheim, who appears on ""Selling Sunset"" on Netflix, shares the listing with colleagues Mary Fitzgerald and Peter Cornell as well as Brian Stace from Pinnacle Estate Properties. Mr. Oppenheim declined to comment on matters related to the sellers.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Beijing Now Praises Doctor --- China tries to assuage public anger over death of physician who had raised virus alarms

HONG KONG -- Weeks after Chinese social media erupted in grief and rage over the death of a doctor reprimanded by police for raising early alarms about the new coronavirus, Beijing is seeking to assuage public anger by rescinding his penalty and punishing those who rebuked him.

In remarks issued late Thursday, the Chinese government's top anticorruption agency praised Li Wenliang as a caring and committed doctor who was improperly punished by police for what officials now say were his well-intentioned efforts to alert others about the virus.

The National Supervisory Commission also warned against popular efforts to memorialize Dr. Li as a symbol of resistance against China's ruling Communist Party and its suppression of free speech. ""Li Wenliang was a Communist Party member, not a so-called antiestablishment figure,"" a commission official said in remarks carried by state media.

The commission also said it has asked authorities in the central city of Wuhan -- where the pandemic began, and where Dr. Li was based -- to revoke the reprimand that local police had issued to the doctor and hold those involved to account.

Wuhan's police agency separately said it has nullified the reprimand, imposed administrative penalties on two officers and apologized to Dr. Li's family.

News of the commission's findings rippled rapidly across Chinese social media, where a hashtag about the report garnered more than 250 million views on the Weibo microblogging platform as of Thursday night. At one point, the volume of views grew by more than a million a minute.

While some Weibo users welcomed Dr. Li's rehabilitation, many more voiced incredulity and anger at what they saw as the scapegoating of local officials. ""That's it?"" many wrote in response, seemingly dissatisfied that the probe didn't answer questions about broader government failings.

""Grassroots-level police and Dr. Li Wenliang are the same,"" one Weibo user wrote. ""Carrying the can for the erroneous judgments and decision-making by certain departments!""

Police in Wuhan had interrogated Dr. Li days after he warned former classmates on Dec. 30 about a new pathogen. They accused the doctor of spreading rumors and made him write a statement admitting to ""illegal behavior.""

Dr. Li, a 34-year-old ophthalmologist, was later infected by the coronavirus and died in early February. His plight captivated China and triggered an extraordinary outpouring of emotion as he lay ill. His death sparked widespread anger on Chinese social media, where users accused the Communist Party of silencing whistleblowers and mishandling its response to the coronavirus.

Millions of Chinese mourned Dr. Li and eulogized him as a hero who symbolized the public's determination to seek transparency and speech freedoms from their government.

Beijing has sought to mollify such sentiment. A day after Dr. Li died, the supervisory commission said it was sending a special team to investigate the circumstances around his treatment and death. Earlier this month, authorities named Dr. Li to an honor roll of 506 ""vanguard"" medical workers who distinguished themselves in epidemic-control efforts.

Central-government officials and state media have also blamed authorities in Hubei province and Wuhan, its capital, for initial missteps in their epidemic response, and replaced senior officials there.

The commission's probe culminated Thursday in a lengthy report detailing its findings on how Dr. Li received and passed along information about a coronavirus spreading in Wuhan, his subsequent punishment, as well as details on how he contracted the virus and died.

In a separate interview with the official Xinhua News Agency, an unidentified commission official sought to dispel speculation that medically unnecessary interventions were used to prolong Dr. Li's life for political purposes.

The official acknowledged the conflicting media reports and hospital announcements over the timing of Dr. Li's death. The official time of his death was in the early hours of Feb. 7 -- more than five hours after the first reports of his passing.

Medical personnel treating Dr. Li said ""at the time they wanted to do their utmost to revive him, so they carried out resuscitation for a very long time,"" the official said.

The commission dismissed public perceptions of Dr. Li as a whistleblower, saying he had disseminated inaccurate information about the new virus without verifying it.

""In trying to attack the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government, some hostile forces have given Dr. Li Wenliang anti-establishment labels like 'hero' and 'awakener,' "" the official said. These efforts to ""fan flames, confuse people's minds and incite social emotions are destined to fail.""

Such remarks didn't ward off a fresh outpouring of emotion on social media. ""Dr. Li, perhaps tonight's outcome can give you a tiny bit of consolation,"" one user wrote. ""But it's still far from sufficient to let you rest in peace.""

U.S. News: Fed Likely to Buy Even More Bonds

The Federal Reserve is likely to significantly boost its government-bond purchases beyond the $500 billion minimum it committed Sunday to buy amid market strains that sent interest rates higher in recent days.

The Fed took a significant step in that direction Thursday, announcing it would purchase $150 billion in securities on Thursday and Friday -- on top of $125 billion in purchases earlier this week.

This means the Fed will have bought more than half of the $500 billion in Treasury securities in one week with little sign of restored market functioning, pointing to a growing likelihood for a much more aggressive round of purchases than appeared likely just a few days ago. The central bank on Sunday also approved purchases of at least $200 billion in mortgage bonds.

Notably, the Fed didn't limit itself from additional purchases. Instead, the quantities announced Sunday, which it said would be executed over coming months, are minimum amounts the New York Fed has been directed to buy.

The rapid pace of bond buying suggests Fed officials will need to consider in the coming days how to communicate their intentions about even-larger quantities of purchases amid a full-throated effort to prevent strains in financial markets from undermining national efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic.

Mortgage bond markets have also shown severe strains in recent days, and the New York Fed said Thursday it would purchase $20 billion in those assets later in the day and $32 billion more on Friday.

The Fed purchased more than $3 trillion in Treasury and mortgage securities in three separate rounds of bond buying, dubbed quantitative easing or QE, between 2008 and 2014.

To get a sense of the scale of recent purchases, the current round is on pace to exceed in just weeks the $600 billion in the second round of bond buying, called QE2, that the Fed conducted between November 2010 and June 2011.

Those programs were criticized by some Republican lawmakers, conservative economists and some Fed officials. They warned it would lead to runaway inflation, which it didn't, or that it represented an improper incursion by the central bank into fiscal policy.

Thus far, the new purchases have met with few, if any, objections from lawmakers on Capitol Hill.

While an initial round of purchases was focused on improving market functioning during the height of the 2008 financial crisis, most of the purchases were aimed at helping stimulate economic growth by pushing down long-term yields and encouraging investors to buy riskier assets like corporate bonds and stocks.

The current purchases are focused squarely on reducing turmoil in financial markets, rather than on stimulating economic activity.

For the Fed and the Trump administration, the purchases could prove to be one of the most powerful tools deployed by the U.S. government. Not only do the purchases pump money into the financial system and avert higher borrowing costs, but they could facilitate the large federal budget deficits that will be needed to fight the virus and the economic toll it takes on the nation.

U.S. News: Jobless Claims Soar in Harbinger of Upheaval

WASHINGTON -- The number of Americans applying for first-time unemployment benefits increased sharply last week, the front end of a surge in jobless claims tied to the new coronavirus pandemic.

Initial jobless claims increased by 70,000 in the week ended Saturday to a seasonally adjusted 281,000, marking the fourth-biggest jump for jobless claims on record back to 1967. It also brought claims to the highest level since September 2017, following Hurricane Harvey, which struck the U.S. and disrupted business activity.

Several states specifically cited coronavirus-related layoffs last week, the report said. Many states have reported higher layoffs in services industries, particularly restaurants.

The survey period for Thursday's Labor Department release was before many states started reporting higher numbers of claims this week related to business closures because of the coronavirus.

""It certainly looks like we'll have a significant increase next week,"" said Josh Wright, chief economist at iCIMS Inc. ""This is a national disaster that is already morphing into a financial and economic crisis.""

The trajectory of jobless claims in the medium term depends on how many companies have a cash buffer to help weather the crisis, he said.

Earlier this week, many states ordered businesses in public places, such as restaurants and bars, to temporarily close to protect against the spread of coronavirus. The mandates hit employment in the leisure-and-hospitality industry, which accounts for about 11% of nonfarm payrolls, particularly hard.

States, including large ones such as New York, experienced a sudden rush for unemployment benefits, though it isn't clear what percentage of Americans seeking benefits were unemployed, furloughed or working reduced hours.

New York's website to register for unemployment benefits is averaging 250,000 logins a day, a 400% increase over its typical average, according to a department spokesperson.

Ohio's four-day total for jobless claims through Wednesday was 111,055, compared with about 4,000 for the same period last week. Connecticut filers submitted more than 30,000 new claims between Monday and Wednesday, compared with just 2,500 all last week. Michigan and Kentucky also reported jumps in volume.

Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, a state with one of the highest number of coronavirus cases, said in a Wednesday briefing that the state received 80,000 unemployment insurance applications Tuesday, compared with an average of 2,000 claims a day typically.

Washington, another state with a large number of coronavirus cases, is hiring more than 100 workers to handle unemployment applications, and extending its customer service to seven days a week.

Just a couple of weeks ago the labor market appeared robust, underscoring how quickly the virus has roiled the U.S. economy.

IMF

Mnuchin Ally Picked

As No. 2 Official

The International Monetary Fund formally approved the Trump administration's pick to become the fund's No. 2 official, just a week after his name was proposed, signaling a desire to coordinate closely with the U.S. government in providing IMF financial support to countries suffering from the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.

The appointment of Geoffrey Okamoto, a top international official in the U.S. Treasury Department , establishes a tie between the department and the IMF , the international lender of last resort. The IMF has said it is prepared to make its roughly $1 trillion lending capacity available to support the crisis response and recovery.

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Okamoto, who will be the top American official at the IMF , said: ""The message is very clear. We're going to do whatever it takes to get to the other side of this.""

The IMF is collectively owned by its 189 member countries, but the U.S. is by far the institution's largest shareholder and its support can rapidly accelerate the fund's programs.

Mr. Okamoto, 35 years old, has been the Treasury's acting assistant secretary of the Treasury for international finance and development, where he has worked closely with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for the past three years.

Mr. Okamoto said he saw his mission as ensuring the IMF acts swiftly with its programs, which can provide funds to destabilized governments.

GERMANY

Government Moves

On Far-Right Group

Germany carried out nationwide raids on alleged members of a secretive group who reject the authority of the state, adhere to racist ideologies and hoard weapons.

Authorities said they had banned the targeted group, called United German Peoples and Tribes, and uncovered guns, racist propaganda and drugs in the course of the searches.

The organization is affiliated with the so-called Citizens of the Reich, or Reichsburger, a loose-knit movement whose adherents reject Germany's government as illegitimate and have been involved in clashes with police and other state officials in recent years.

INDIA

Four Men Hanged for

Gang Rape-Murder

India on Friday morning hanged four men convicted of the 2012 gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student in the capital, hoping to send the message that the nation takes women's safety seriously.

The attack, in which the woman was repeatedly raped and sexually assaulted with a metal bar on a moving bus before being dumped on a roadside, became one of India's most high-profile crimes against women. The victim, who can't be named publicly under Indian law, died in a Singapore hospital from her injuries 13 days after the attack.

The story of the crime that ended the life of a woman who was following her dream of carving a better life for herself and her family resonated with people in the world's largest democracy as it seeks its own footing as a rising economic power. It galvanized public opinion and sparked mass demonstrations, and demand for action. It led to the strengthening of laws and greater public awareness about violence against women.

Before the execution of the convicts, numerous pleas and appeals from them, their families and lawyers for mercy were turned down by the courts and the government. The last failed plea came hours before they were hanged at a jail in New Delhi about 5:30 a.m. Friday.

Talking to the media soon after the hangings, the mother of the woman spoke of her daughter. ""I couldn't save her,"" she said, ""but finally she got justice.""

LONDON -- The Bank of England cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low and said it would buy GBP 200 billion ($232 billion) of U.K. government bonds, the latest in a flurry of central-bank action to combat the economic damage form the coronavirus.

At an emergency meeting, policy makers concluded that further stimulus was needed to ease growing financial strain and support growth and inflation, the BOE said Thursday.

Officials voted unanimously to cut the BOE's benchmark rate to 0.1% from 0.25%, just a week after announcing a half-percentage-point rate reduction and a new program to support lending to small and midsize businesses. They also agreed to increase the size of the BOE's bond portfolio to GBP 645 billion, from GBP 445 billion.

""We are in an absolutely unprecedented situation,"" Bank of England Gov. Andrew Bailey said. He said officials acted outside their normal schedule following a selloff in sterling, U.K. government bonds and other assets in tumultuous trading this week, financial strains that were pushing up borrowing costs and sapping credit for businesses and households.

He said officials expect the U.K. to suffer a sharp contraction in output as the virus takes its toll and that the BOE is ready to go further if more stimulus is required. ""No, we're not done,"" Mr. Bailey said.

The European Central Bank on Wednesday unveiled a new 750 billion euros ($799.7 billion) bond-buying program.

The Federal Reserve on Thursday said it would expand its program to lend dollars to nine additional central banks to alleviate strains in financial markets.

SAO PAULO -- Brazil closed its borders with eight neighboring countries on Thursday, joining other South American nations in a continentwide quarantine as authorities struggle to control the spread of the coronavirus.

The measure taken by Brazil, the region's largest economy, applies to Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Guyana and the French overseas department of Guiana. Brazil's border with Venezuela was already closed. The border with Uruguay remains open for now.

Brazil has a total of about 10,000 miles of land borders with its neighbors, and all but about 650 miles of them, with Uruguay, are now closed.

In recent days, countries across the region have quickly moved to seal national borders as coronavirus cases rise, leaving thousands of travelers stranded. And the downturn in China has drawn fears of a protracted slowdown for South America's largely commodities-driven economies and a tougher rebound.

""South America was caught flat-footed, and now they're trying to catch up,"" said Eric Farnsworth, who tracks the region for the Americas Society/Council of the Americas, a Washington-based policy group. ""2020 was already going to be a year of sluggish growth. Now, the virus is clearly going to add downward pressure.""

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on Thursday downgraded its economic projections for Latin America, citing the fallout from the spread of the virus. Economists for the company had expected modest growth in 2020, but now forecast a 1.2% contraction for the region's seven-biggest countries, with gross domestic product shrinking in Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Ecuador as well. Goldman Sachs forecasts zero growth in Colombia and Peru.

Some of the region's biggest businesses are being forced to cut back operations. Chilean-based Latam Airlines Group SA said it was canceling 90% of its international flights, while asking workers to take a 50% pay cut.

Corporacion Nacional del Cobre de Chile, or Codelco, the world's biggest copper producer, said it was ramping down its operations in Chile to protect the health of workers as President Sebastian Pinera on Thursday announced a $11.7 billion plan to support the economy.

Brazil, which has reported six deaths from the virus, closed its land borders with its neighboring countries for 15 days, with the possibility of an extension, according to the official government newspaper.

Brazilian citizens and residents are still allowed to enter the country, as are foreign citizens working for international organizations or otherwise authorized by the Brazilian government. Trucks carrying commercial goods are also permitted to cross the border.

On Thursday, Colombia also said travelers, including Colombian citizens, would be barred from entering the country beginning next week.

Ex-Google Car Project Engineer in Plea Deal

Anthony Levandowski, the engineer charged in August with 33 counts of trade-secret theft from Google's self-driving car project, reached a deal with U.S. prosecutors in which he will plead guilty to one count and the remaining charges will be dropped.

According to a court filing Thursday, Mr. Levandowski will plead guilty to the last count in the indictment, charging him with theft and attempted theft of trade secrets related to ""Project Chauffeur,"" as Google's autonomous vehicle program was called at the time.

Specifically, Mr. Levandowski said he downloaded a weekly update for the program ""with the intent to use it to benefit someone other than Google,"" the legal filing shows.

""Mr. Levandowski accepts responsibility and is looking forward to resolving this matter,"" Miles Ehrlich, a lawyer for Mr. Levandowski, said in a statement. ""Mr. Levandowski is a young man with enormous talents and much to contribute to the fast-moving world of AI and AV and we hope that this plea will allow him to move on with his life and focus his energies where they matter most.""

Mr. Levandowski left Google's self-driving car unit, Waymo, in 2016 and helped start a company soon acquired by Uber Technologies Inc.

Google parent Alphabet Inc. sued Uber in 2017, claiming that Mr. Levandowski stole more than 14,000 confidential files before leaving Google. Waymo and Uber settled the lawsuit in 2018, but not before the judge in the case asked federal prosecutors to investigate Uber and Mr. Levandowski over possible trade-secret theft.

""Mr. Levandowski's guilty plea in a criminal hearing today brings to an end a seminal case for our company and the self-driving industry, and underscores the value of Waymo's intellectual property,"" a spokeswoman for Waymo said in a statement.

According to the plea agreement, Mr. Levandowski agreed to a level 17 offense, which has federal guidelines for a sentence of 24 to 30 months in prison. He also agreed to pay Waymo $756,499 restitution.

The plea agreement will resolve the criminal charges against Mr. Levandowski, but there are outstanding issues with his previous employers.

Earlier this month, a judge ordered Mr. Levandowski to pay $179 million to Google, the sum of an award determined in December by an arbitration panel plus interest and lawyers' fees.

The same day of the legal judgment, Mr. Levandowski filed for bankruptcy, listing estimated assets of $50 million to $100 million and estimated liabilities of $100 million to $500 million.

A spokesman for Uber declined to comment.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Coronavirus and Public Order

Pressure groups of all stripes see an opportunity in the coronavirus crisis, and that includes criminal-justice activists. Even as society locks down, localities across the country are unlocking jail cells and softening law enforcement to slow the spread of the disease. The risk is that public order starts to unravel at a time it is most needed.

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday the city would identify for release ""any inmates who need to be brought out because of either their own health conditions"" or ""because the charges were minor."" Los Angeles County jails have reduced their number of inmates by more than 1,000 since last month and arrests are down sharply. In one county in the San Francisco Bay area, 247 inmates were granted early release this week.

A group of progressive local prosecutors put out a letter calling for ""steps to dramatically reduce detention and the incarcerated population."" They also want police departments to adopt ""cite and release policies for offenses which pose no immediate physical threat."" Philadelphia has already implemented a delayed-arrest policy for non-violent offenses including theft and drug crimes, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. Local news outlets report that police departments from Denver to Southwest Florida are aiming to cut down on arrests to minimize exposure of officers and jail workers.

Some of these steps may be necessary. Crowded jails could face ugly virus outbreaks and they may need to create space to quarantine inmates who get sick. Yet it's important that the virus doesn't simply become a political license for under-enforcement that progressives couldn't get into law in normal times. Cyber-criminals are already exploiting the situation with phishing scams, and public disorder could spread as lockdowns continue, unemployment surges and economic pressure builds.

Like the virus, crime can appear suddenly and grow quickly. We know from the history of broken-windows policing that proactive enforcement suppresses crime, and we know from the crime spike that followed the Ferguson, Mo., controversy of 2014 that relaxed enforcement can embolden criminals. Even as law enforcement takes reasonable steps against the virus, we hope officials remember that the nation's response will suffer if private property isn't protected and public order isn't maintained.

REVIEW --- The End of Globalization? Don't Count On It --- The Covid-19 pandemic might be closing borders and disrupting supply chains, but it can't stop our long-term movement toward a more interconnected world.

Corrections & Amplifications

The United Nations World Tourism Organization estimated there were 1.5 billion international tourist arrivals last year. A Review article on Saturday about globalization incorrectly said 14 billion.

(WSJ March 24, 2020)

(END)

Over the past week, the coronavirus has gone from an Asian contagion with ripple effects on international supply chains to a global pandemic that will plunge the whole world into recession. Travel has been halted across the globe. Borders are shut. Hundreds of millions of people are in effective lockdown in the European Union, and the U.S. is heading in that direction. The crisis has erased trillions of dollars from global stock markets and imperiled the future of millions of small businesses around the world, along with the livelihoods of vast numbers of wage earners.

In the months ahead, we are likely to see one of the sharpest economic contractions on record, and the downturn will undoubtedly serve as yet more evidence for those who have argued in recent years that globalization is coming to an end, or at least being rolled back. Nicolas Tenzer, chair of the Cerap think tank in Paris, argues that the rising barriers in response to the virus will strengthen ""the populist and nationalist forces that have long called for reinforcing borders. It is a true gift for them."" The veteran U.S. market commentator Gary Shilling recently wrote, ""The coronavirus's depressing effects on the global economy and disruptions of supply chains is . . . driving the last nail into the coffin of the globalists."" Ian Bremmer, founder of the risk-consultancy Eurasia Group, sees a starker era ahead, including more palpable tension between the U.S. and China. ""Globalization has been the biggest driver of economic growth,"" he says. ""Its trajectory is now shifting, largely for geopolitical reasons, and that will be accelerated by the coronavirus crisis.""

In the midst of our current spiral, it is hard to resist such dire forecasts. But we should. There is every reason to think that our post-coronavirus future will see not an end to the globalizing trend of recent decades but a new chapter in that story. The sudden halt in commerce and travel precipitated by the outbreak will not snap back overnight, and the next few years will see a re-nationalization of some industries for countries that can. But when this crisis passes, we are likely to find fresh confirmation of what we already know about globalization: that it's easy to hate, convenient to target and impossible to stop.

Even before the virus, there were indications of both a pause and a modest pullback in globalization. Last year, global trade contracted a smidgen, by less than 1%, but at $19 trillion, it was still higher than any year before the record-setting 2018. As for China and the U.S., the dual effect of the Trump administration's tariffs and the assertive nationalism of Xi Jinping put a brake on further integration. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau show that the total value of trade in goods between the two countries declined from $630 billion in 2017 to $560 billion in 2019. Even so, this pullback just puts the U.S. and China back at the trade level of 2013. And that amount, it should be noted, is almost five times what it was in 2001. In short, even after two years of trade war and diplomatic acrimony, the key axis of globalization was dented, but only barely.

As the U.S. was erecting tariffs, the Chinese government, for its part, was ramping up spending abroad. Since 2014, China's Belt and Road Initiative has invested almost $1 trillion in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia and elsewhere. According to the consulting firm Gavekal Dragonomics, the rate of new Chinese investment slowed to just over $100 billion last year, but the initiative remains an incontrovertible example of China-driven globalization.

Nor is the coronavirus likely to reverse that trend. A recent report from the Carnegie Endowment notes that, as China emerges more swiftly from the crisis than other parts of the world, its leaders are hinting that they plan to increase investments abroad in a world that will be hungry for capital. In recent weeks, Beijing has delivered medical supplies, equipment and doctors to Italy and other EU countries. As the crisis expands, China appears committed to more engagement with the outside world, not less.

The same has been true for the private sector in the U.S. Even before the eruption of the coronavirus, there was considerable discussion of the need for economic decoupling from China. But displeasure with the bilateral relationship hasn't meant any real retrenchment away from globalization for American firms; they have instead tried to diversify and establish connections to other parts of the world.

Apple, for instance, had bet heavily on China as a manufacturing and distribution hub as well as a burgeoning market, which made the company vulnerable when tensions and tariffs flared. As The Journal recently reported, Apple is now looking to move some of its China-based operations elsewhere, in reaction to both the trade war and the supply chain havoc caused by the coronavirus. But the company's likeliest move will be to other locations in East Asia, not to American shores.

The recently rejiggered North American free-trade agreement is another instance of continued U.S. commitment to globalization, even on the part of the skeptical Trump administration. The agreement is designed to facilitate more trade, and the scale of continental trade is indeed increasing. Mexico is now the largest U.S. trading partner, outstripping both Canada and China.

Data compiled by the Organization for International Investment show that foreign direct investment in the U.S., although down in 2019 after reaching a peak in 2015 and 2016 of $500 billion, was still above the level of every other prior year. On the other side of the equation, U.S. investment abroad decreased to just under $6 trillion at the end of 2018 (the last year for which data is available) due to repatriation of earnings held by companies abroad. But to put that number in perspective: It was barely $1 trillion in 2001.

The same pattern pertains everywhere. In Europe, Brexit notwithstanding, economic integration continues apace. In fact, Brexit spurred a substantial increase in cross-border investments within the remaining eurozone countries. The shock of one of its key members leaving seems to have redoubled the efforts of the remaining 27 nations to draw closer, with a 43% increase in 2019 alone, according to data firm FDI Markets. A study from the London School of Economics shows that Brexit even spurred more British investment in Europe, with an increase of 12% between the 2016 referendum and the end of 2018.

The post-coronavirus recovery is certain to bring increased spending from individual European governments and the EU itself. Europe's recovery from the financial crisis of 2007-08 was hampered by north-south divisions. With the coronavirus now hitting the whole continent with growing force, those divisions will subside. The European Central Bank has already announced a 750 billion euro ($810 billion) bond-buying program; in the worst phase of the last financial crisis, it took months of acrimonious debate for the ECB to do much at all.

Post-virus investment is likely to pick up as well throughout Latin America, Africa and especially East Asia, where the Trans-Pacific Partnership (absent the U.S.) has streamlined economic relations. Such connections will expand in the wake of the present crisis, for reasons not of altruism but of self-interest.

The coronavirus pandemic is, obviously, a negative byproduct of our hyper-connected world, and it has brought about a nearly complete halt of global travel and tourism. When countries were truly more like islands, diseases had less opportunity to skip from population to population. The scale of travel today for tourism, trade and business has made it far harder to contain a pandemic. In 1950, according to the U.N. World Tourism Organization, there were 25 million tourist arrivals; last year, there were 14 billion.

And tourism has become a booming business across the world. Between 2006 and 2019, it grew from $5 trillion in direct and indirect value to more than $9 trillion. The continuing collapse of demand for travel will be acutely felt and ripple around the world, from Cambodian resorts to Mexican beaches and New York musicals.

Yet tourism and travel, along with the related phenomenon of millions of students from dozens of countries studying abroad, are among the more potent symbols of how deeply interconnected the world has become. The alarming spread of the coronavirus in recent weeks has indeed provoked a drawbridge reaction in many countries, but the response also suggests that the only reliable inoculation against future pandemics will be transnational cooperation.

By all accounts, such coordination is already in play in the medical and scientific community, as they race to understand the virus and create cures and treatments. More international partnerships will be necessary as we assess the economic wreckage that the pandemic will leave. Enlightened self-interest in working together to prevent such a crisis from happening again could well trump the knee-jerk reaction to retreat to national fortresses that are anything but secure.

Though months without familiar modes of travel may forever change patterns of behavior, judging from how people have snapped back after previous crises, that seems unlikely. Once the worst has passed, we may find waves of pent-up demand for millions of people to venture once more into the world, this time with coordinated health screening across countries akin to what emerged in the post-9/11 world to prevent the flow of people, money and goods that might support terrorist organizations.

And then there is the flow of capital. Markets in the past few weeks have crashed globally, in sync and almost simultaneously. In the U.S., as much as $10 trillion has been erased from markets. Every major market in the world saw equities lose 20% to 30%, and bonds have swung wildly and destructively.

But it isn't just goods and people that have circled the world in ever more energetic motion over the past two decades; money has too. In the past 15 years, according to the Federal Reserve, U.S. holdings of foreign securities rose from $6 trillion to more than $12 trillion, and similar explosive growth occurred for countries around the world. That has gone hand in hand with loosening rules on capital flows. China alone, among major economic players, has meaningful capital restrictions, and only its domestic markets move out of sync with the financial markets of the rest of the world.

The absence of any real capital controls and the vastly increased appetite to invest everywhere is why financial markets began crashing once the coronavirus leapt from China. It took weeks for the disease itself to move from South Korea to Europe to the U.S., but it only took days for the financial contagion to spread. That is the pain of the moment for investors, but it is also provides a glimmer of the possible pace and scale of the global recovery when it arrives. Money can evaporate in a heartbeat and flow in an instant.

It is easy to imagine the demise of our massively interdependent world at a moment when it comes to a rapid, vertiginous halt. But a sharp contraction caused by a pandemic is not the same as a permanent reversal of the deep and complicated global integration of supply chains, markets and daily life built up over the past two decades. Those relationships are durable and beneficial and will be difficult to sever. Some are ready to try, but most of the world isn't eager to renationalize industry, make trillions of dollars of global investment worthless and suppress the appetite for easy travel and free movement of people, goods and capital. The coronavirus is unlikely to be the moment when we see the collapse of a broad historical trend that has endured through the Great Depression, World War II, the Cold War and innumerable other crises, from 9/11 to the financial upheaval of 2007-08.

The months ahead will feel like the presumptive end of an era of globalization. And it may be the end of globalization's first phase, with its heady optimism and corresponding ideological and economic backlash. But there will be a next phase, one less rosy-eyed and less sour as well.

As citizens emerge from various forms of sheltering in place, they will confront the days of spring with the relief and bewilderment of our predecessors in World War II emerging from a bomb shelter the morning after. They will find a changed world of travel limitations and viral testing but also a massive global system that remains structurally intact, if on the defensive philosophically. But the sheer scale of what has been created over the past several decades, to say nothing of the enormous benefits that have flowed from it for billions of people, will preclude a lasting reversal. We will discover that we are indeed all in this together.

Is it possible that we are truly at the end? Yes, but not likely. Globalization is dead. Long live globalization.

The Glass Hotel

By Emily St. John Mandel

Knopf, 301 pages, $26.95

Six years ago, Emily St. John Mandel's dystopian novel ""Station Eleven"" opened with the Georgia Flu pandemic decimating our species and ended -- two decades after the collapse of civilization -- with one of the survivors daring to imagine a future. ""Clark looks up at the evening activity on the tarmac, at the planes that have been grounded for twenty years, the reflection of his candle flickering in the glass. He has no expectation of seeing an airplane rise again in his lifetime, but is it possible that somewhere there are ships setting out? If there are again towns with streetlights . . . then what else might this awakening world contain?"" That consoling vision was accompanied, however, by an overwhelming sense of loss for many readers, and no wonder. In ""Station Eleven,"" Ms. Mandel had created a dreamlike reality so tangible and complete that emerging from it felt like banishment. (The audio book, by the way, only enhances that sensation.) And ever since then, this writer's exiled devotees have wondered where she would take them next.

The answer, perhaps surprisingly, is to the world of money, which materializes in Ms. Mandel's new novel, ""The Glass Hotel,"" as both familiar and profoundly strange. The catastrophe this time is financial, not biological. A swindler, not a pandemic, is to blame (in events that mirror the 2008 collapse of Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme), and contagion is limited to a population of eager investors, one of whom learns the truth from his accountant this way:

""Your money's gone,"" she said softly.

""All of it?""

""Leon, it wasn't real . . .""

The question of what is real -- be it love, money, place or memory -- has always been at the heart of Ms. Mandel's fiction. From the betrayals running through ""Last Night in Montreal"" (2009) to the identity fraud in ""The Singer's Gun"" (2010) and the switchback crimes of ""The Lola Quartet"" (2012), her narratives snake their way across treacherous, shifting terrain. Certainties are blurred, truth becomes malleable and in ""The Glass Hotel"" the con man thrives. ""He had that trick,"" Leon observes, referring to the Ponzi scheme's perpetrator, ""of appearing utterly indifferent to what anyone thought of him, and in so doing provoking the opposite anxiety in other people: What does Alkaitis think of me?"" The head of a fraudulent investment company, Jonathan Alkaitis owns, among other palaces, an island hotel in British Columbia where, on a brief visit, he reels in Leon Prevant, a gullible shipping executive. Alkaitis also charms Vincent Smith, the hotel's young, but far from gullible, female bartender. ""In the way he spoke to her, his obvious wealth and his obvious interest, she saw an opening into a vastly easier life or at least a different life,"" Vincent admits, ignoring, while she can, the price she might pay.

A fascinatingly elusive character, Vincent quickly becomes Alkaitis's second wife (though he never formally marries her) and glides between Manhattan and Connecticut, Europe and Dubai, until the Ponzi scheme implodes, the ""kingdom of money"" vanishes and Alkaitis is imprisoned for life. Bewildered at first, he ""pretends he's on an alien planet"" and then, as decades of incarceration pass, retreats into an imaginary existence. ""When he isn't in the counterlife,"" as Alkaitis thinks of that realm, ""he likes to dwell in a green field in his hometown, in the twilight following a family picnic.""

The victims of Alkaitis's crimes are also plunged into an altered reality, one in which money simply evaporates and the certainties of everyday life disintegrate. Financially destitute Leon Prevant and his wife, for example, enter the ""shadow country"" of the poor, migrating across the country from one menial job to the next. ""You stare at the road and the road stares back,"" Leon muses at a truck stop where desperate girls hitch rides at night: ""They'd all been cut loose, they'd slipped beneath the surface of the United States, they were adrift."" Vincent, for her part, goes to sea, becoming a ship's cook to sail the world, recalling her long-disappeared mother's stories of ""northern lights shifting over a winter sky, the silent towers of icebergs in a dark gray sea.""

Such lyrical, hypnotic images -- of a shoreline at dusk, for example, or a city street at dawn -- suspend us in a kind of hallucinatory present where every detail is sharply defined yet queasily unreliable. A sense of unease thickens as the novel's interlinked narratives orbit the main drama of Alkaitis's downfall. Characters such as Walter, the island hotel's manager; Olivia, an aging painter duped by Alkaitis; and Paul, Vincent's aimless half-brother, each wonderfully drawn, disappear and reappear, tilting the novel's perspective and tightening the suspense as the narrative meanders back and forth in time. Chronology, as always in Ms. Mandel's fiction, becomes fluid. ""The Glass Hotel"" opens and ends with a drowning in 2018, and in between follows an elliptical course whose starting point is 1994. Toward the end, there is a leap forward to 2029. The dead begin to visit the living. Characters from previous novels surface -- Leon and his former assistant Miranda are here from ""Station Eleven,"" Alkaitis from ""The Lola Quartet"" -- and Vincent idly imagines what the Georgia Flu might have wrought had it not been swiftly contained.

All of which is clever and, perhaps intentionally, alienating. For in this hall-of-mirrors novel, Ms. Mandel invites us to observe her characters from a distance even as we enter their lives, a feat she achieves with remarkable skill. And if the result is a sense not only of detachment but also of desolation, then maybe that's the point. ""I'm happiest when I'm away from other people,"" Walter confesses when he becomes caretaker of the shuttered hotel. ""Without furniture, the lobby was like a shadowy ballroom,"" he later observes, contentedly, ""a vast empty space with a panorama of wilderness beyond the glass: inland waters, green shorelines, a pier with no boats."" The scene, in its tranquility, recalls Clark's final vision in ""Station Eleven,"" but the wounded survivors of this catastrophe crave connection in vain. They settle instead for isolation.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Tax-Filing Deadline Extended to July 15

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. is extending the April 15 tax-filing deadline to July 15, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday. That will give people more time to prepare and pay their taxes as workers lose jobs and businesses close during the coronavirus pandemic.

Earlier this past week, the Internal Revenue Service said that most taxpayers could defer payments until July but would still have to file their tax returns or seek extensions by April 15. That announcement drew quick criticism from lawmakers and tax preparers, who warned that they couldn't get those filings done or would have to risk their safety and health to do it.

And tax filers who typically get help at sites staffed by IRS volunteers or use IRS tax help for the elderly may have trouble getting the information they need as the government limits face-to-face interactions during the pandemic.

So Mr. Mnuchin offered the additional extensions on Friday.

Still, he urged Americans who are expecting tax refunds to file when they can, so that they can get their money.

Mr. Mnuchin's tweets didn't specify how the updated deadlines would work. The IRS typically handles that with a detailed notice, but that hasn't been released yet.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Britain Escalates Its Response

LONDON -- The British government stepped up its response to the coronavirus epidemic, telling companies it would foot the lion's share of their salary bills as long as they hang on to workers, and ordering all bars and restaurants in the country to close.

The broad package of measures, announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Treasury chief Rishi Sunak, marks another escalation in world-wide efforts to fight the disease and pave the way for an eventual economic revival.

The salvo by U.K. policy makers is aimed at preventing mass layoffs and supporting workers' incomes as the coronavirus threat -- and an intensifying government squeeze to contain it -- shuts down chunks of British business.

Mr. Johnson said as of Friday all bars, pubs, restaurants, cafes, gyms and theaters must shut their doors, an effort to slow the spread of a virus that has infected almost 4,000 in the U.K. and killed 177.

The prime minister's decision marks another shift away from an unorthodox strategy that had so far avoided strict measures adopted in other countries. Mr. Johnson said the escalation is needed ""to push down further on that curve of transmission between us.""

He acknowledged Britons may find it difficult. ""We are taking away the ancient, inalienable right of freeborn people of the United Kingdom to go to the pub,"" he said.

The new measures augment an economic-policy response that has already included deep interest-rate cuts and large-scale asset purchases by the Bank of England. The latest steps add to fiscal commitments that potentially could reach GBP 400 billion ($459 billion), or around 16% of the country's annual national income.

""We're going to defeat this disease with a huge national effort,"" Mr. Johnson said at a press conference.

In the U.S., the Federal Reserve has cut short-term interest rates, revived asset purchases and taken action to ease funding strains in financial markets. Lawmakers are debating a Trump administration plan to send checks directly to Americans as part of a $1 trillion stimulus package to help households and businesses.

But there are already signs of mounting layoffs, with malls, restaurants and hotels closing in many areas of the country.

The British plan, which echoes policies already adopted by other European states, is aimed at avoiding such layoffs, though economists say some increase in unemployment is unavoidable as the havoc wrought by the virus tips the country toward recession.

Mr. Sunak, a former hedge fund executive who has been in the role of Chancellor of the Exchequer for less than two months, said that the government will make an intervention in the economy ""unprecedented in the history of the British state.""

He said the Treasury will dish out cash to companies to cover the cost of 80% of workers' wages provided they don't lay them off as the disease rages.

The program will be up and running before the end of April, will run for at least three months, and can be extended, Mr. Sunak said. Payments are capped at GBP 2,500 ($2,871) a month. Firms that need cash immediately can tap banks for government-backed, interest-free loans from Monday, he said.

Mr. Sunak said the government will finance the payments with additional borrowing and didn't put a ceiling on the amount it is prepared to spend. Economists at consulting firm Oxford Economics estimated the bill for three months would be around GBP 18 billion, depending on takeup.

Mr. Sunak also announced that firms can defer payment of value-added tax, a sales tax, until the end of June, forgoing for now around GBP 30 billion in tax revenue. He also increased out-of-work benefits and said the self-employed won't need to file a tax return until next year.

Other European governments have taken similar steps to aid companies and workers. Germany has revived a financial crisis-era program to pay workers forced to work part-time or furloughed altogether.

In Denmark, the government Sunday said it would pay 75% of the wages of workers in companies that had been hard hit by the virus. The Dutch government has announced a similar initiative, which will cover 90% of wages where businesses would otherwise have to fire workers.

The fiscal package comes after the Bank of England on Thursday cut its benchmark interest rate to 0.1%, the lowest level since the central bank's foundation in 1694, and said it would buy GBP 200 billion of U.K. government bonds to support the economy and stabilize jittery markets for sterling-denominated assets.

Low-Wage Workers Face Brunt of Coronavirus Crisis --- Double hit for service jobs: layoffs, plus high risk of contagion

As coronavirus shutdowns halt commerce across the U.S., low-wage workers, many of whom live paycheck to paycheck, are being quickly stung.

The affected jobs, by their nature, often require personal contact, such as running a cash register or cleaning hotel rooms. That substantially raises the risk of infection.

Many such workers also hold positions most vulnerable to quick job cuts and pay cuts, especially in service industries.

That includes restaurant workers, hotel maids, dog walkers and child-care providers. In many cases, the cuts are tied to shutdowns and cancellations at sports stadiums, conventions, casinos, music festivals and other gatherings.

The group encompasses many workers who were late beneficiaries of the surge in hiring as the labor market tightened in recent years -- including members of minority groups or people with less education and skills -- during one of the longest and most lucrative growth phases in U.S. history.

Malls, restaurants and hotels have closed. Already, the number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits -- a proxy for layoffs -- increased last week by 70,000 from the previous week, with states telling the Labor Department the cause was the pandemic. Economists predict a much bigger surge when numbers are released for this week, with Goldman Sachs Economics Research estimating roughly 2.25 million new claims for jobless benefits.

More than 90% of the announced U.S. job cuts tied to the coronavirus were at restaurants and other entertainment and leisure businesses, according to outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas.

For many who retain their jobs, tips and commissions have evaporated. Working at home isn't an option, nor is sick pay.

""I don't want to leave the job because it's my financial stability,"" said Chandler Schaffer, who is 23 and earns $10.50 an hour working at a pawnshop in South Carolina. For now, he is continuing to work even though he has diabetes and is terrified of being infected by the virus. ""Right now it's a very big pit of uncertainty with everything,"" he said.

Line cook Che Janezich, 35, has watched the crowds thin and her hours dwindle at Omega Ouzeri, the Greek restaurant where she works in Seattle, making $21 an hour, or about $3,000 a month.

Now that the city has shut down restaurants except for takeout service, Ms. Janezich said Thursday that her hours, which went from 45 a week to 25 recently, were cut again to about 11 a week. She has already tapped her savings to pay rent this month.

""I walk down the street and see homeless people every single day. I've always known I'm a paycheck or two away from that,"" she said. ""But now it seems even more real, which is scary.""

She said the only places hiring in the area now are the Amazon.com warehouse or grocery stores, which she said feels like a step backward: ""It's like that cliche of you don't know how good you have it until it's gone.""

There are more than 34 million people in this pool of the most vulnerable workers, or about a quarter of the private workforce. About half this group were employed in services jobs in the hospitality industry, where occupations earn less than the overall median pay for all U.S. workers of $18.58. The median wage for a restaurant job is $11.09 an hour.

The other half come from retail, personal and maintenance service jobs -- many of which start at the minimum wage, as low as $7.25 an hour, depending on the state.

Despite an economic expansion that brought with it a 50-year low in unemployment, many households remain a paycheck away from financial stress. Almost 40% of Americans don't have enough cash on hand to cover an unexpected $400 expense, a 2019 Federal Reserve survey concluded.

The virus relief bill passed by Congress this week expands unemployment insurance and provides more money for food stamps, aiming to provide an initial safety net as layoffs increase. The bill also requires businesses with fewer than 500 employees provide two weeks of paid leave in certain circumstances, with an additional 10 weeks of leave at two-thirds pay for workers to care for children when schools or day cares close.

Meanwhile, potential direct payments to Americans, part of a further stimulus package under discussion in Congress, could provide a cash cushion.

""Getting infected with the virus is not as much of an existential threat to my life as not having money for rent and food,"" said Ali Tahir, of Austin, Texas, who operates a small catering business and works as an event bartender. The two gigs are his only source of income and both are essentially shut down.

He thinks he can't file for unemployment benefits because, like many low-wage and gig-workers, he is self-employed and therefore ineligible.

Mr. Tahir, 35, was counting on making at least $4,000 this month with work surrounding South by Southwest, a weeklong music and film festival that drew 400,000 people last year. This year's event was canceled.

March is normally his busiest month, and the losses are a blow to his income, which was about $24,000 last year.

His catering work often involves cooking in private homes. ""No one really wants you to come to their house and cook right now,"" he said.

His roommate is a computer programmer who is working from home. ""For him, this is a thing on the news ticker,"" he said. ""For me, it's really something to worry about.""

Millions of professionals have been able to hunker down in home offices, insulating themselves from the contagion risks posed by commutes and colleagues. But interacting with others is part of the job for retail and food-service workers.

""So much of customer service has to do with, not you being comfortable, but you making them feel comfortable,"" said Mr. Schaffer, the pawnshop worker, who said he makes around $23,000 a year. ""You have to be close to them. You have to shake hands. You have to have this personal-feeling relationship.""

Sick leave is a rarity among these jobs. Of the lowest 10% of wage earners, 69% didn't have sick leave last year, according to the Labor Department. That compares with 6% of the top 10% of wage earners lacking the benefit. In the accommodation and food services sector, 55% of workers don't have sick leave.

In the recovery after the 2007-09 recession, hospitality jobs have grown nearly 50% faster than the whole private sector, Labor Department data showed. That eventually pulled in parts of the workforce that were the last to benefit from the expansion: African-Americans, Latinos and those with lower levels of education, who now have near record low unemployment rates.

Wages for low earners grew slowly at the beginning of the expansion, but in the past year grew at a faster rate than higher earners, according to the Atlanta Federal Reserve.

""There's a last-in, first-out problem,"" Lisa Cook, an economist at Michigan State University, said. ""The economic effects of this virus are going to have a substantial impact on low-wage workers, who are disproportionately women, African-Americans and Latinos, and it's going to happen quickly.""

Before the crisis hit, things were just getting easier for 41-year-old Erin Schumacher, who worked as a server at two Seattle restaurants, making around $45,000 a year.

She usually had two shifts a week at Etta's, a seafood restaurant, and three or four at Serious Pie, a pizza place with an Amazon worker crowd. She was working enough hours to qualify for health insurance, which kicked in last month, and began saving a little.

Both restaurants closed their doors for at least eight weeks. She already is attempting to work out payment plans for medical bills and rent.

""I started a 401(k) and paid off some credit cards and student loans,"" she said. ""And now it's like, I'm on unemployment.""

She applied for a job at Swedish Medical Center to work as a materials handler, charged with moving medical equipment for $23 an hour, she said, adding that is less than she currently makes and doesn't include benefits. She was told she starts March 30.

The travel and hotel business, which employs millions of low-wage workers, has already been hit. After years of stable employment, Dina Paredes is bracing for uncertainty around her paychecks. The 52-year-old housekeeper at a Westin hotel in downtown Los Angeles has cleaned about 14 rooms per shift for the past eight years. As the hotel's occupancy dropped this month, she and other colleagues have been transitioned to ""on-call"" status. In the past week, she hasn't worked a single day, and she isn't paid unless she gets work.

""Of course it is concerning,"" the mother of four said through a translator for Unite Here Local 11, the union that represents the hotel workers. ""I have family. I have bills I have to pay.""

More white-collar employees working from home means customers aren't riding in taxis, ordering coffee or buying lunch. And they can now take care of their own pets during the day.

Dog-walking service NYC Pooch suspended operations Tuesday and has laid off its staff of about 50 people, said co-founder Shane McEvoy.

When work started to dwindle last week, Mr. McEvoy started giving employees the option of being laid off, so that they could tap unemployment benefits. He said most employees took him up on the offer, because they will be paid more in jobless benefits than they would earn with a few walks a week.

Mr. McEvoy said employees start at New York City's $15 an hour minimum wage and earn commissions. In an interview, he choked up when he said he was unable to keep employees.

""It all comes down to what cash you have on hand,"" he said. ""Everyone would love to keep people. The fact is, it's not possible."" He said he tried to find low-interest loans to keep the business afloat but has struggled to secure financing.

Tyler Dziendziel, of Wyandotte, Mich., feared he would lose about half his income when the NBA and NHL suspended games. One of his two jobs is working security at Detroit's Little Caesars Arena. Mr. Dziendziel, 24, began to debate whether he should pay rent on his mobile home or pay for repairs for a vehicle he needs to do his other job, arranging store displays for Frito-Lay products.

But he received good news this week when he was told team owners would pay him and other arena workers for scheduled shifts through April. ""I'm really happy I'll be getting paid and able to keep up with my bills,"" said Mr. Dziendziel, a member of the United for Respect worker advocacy group.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Leaderless on the Economy

A tumultuous week ended Friday with another slide in financial markets, despite multiple constructive actions by the Federal Reserve and the promise of trillions in cash from Congress. Perhaps investors sense that their leaders in Washington are throwing money at the problem without explaining why or how.

The Trump Administration does now seem to have a good team tackling the health threat from the coronavirus. Vice President Mike Pence is leading a daily briefing that lays out the steps the Administration is taking to slow the virus spread and cope with its medical consequences. The experts are offering a rationale for their policies and some guidance for how Americans should behave. The current shutdown strategy will need to shift to Phase Two soon to avoid large-scale economic damage, but at least we know the why and how.

---

The same can't be said for efforts to address the economic fallout, which is growing by the hour and may soon be unsustainable. The White House message so far has been that the government will spend huge sums and that will solve everything. The markets clearly don't believe it, and why should they since nobody has explained what the current problem is and what, specifically, they want to do about it.

The Fed has been energetic this week in rolling out new authorities to grease the plumbing of the financial system. A guarantee for commercial paper and money-market funds reprises tools from the 2008-2009 panic. Regulators had told us money-funds would never again be a problem, but apparently not.

The Fed is also back-stopping muni-bond funds, which have also been showing signs of stress. Investors had piled into munis to get tax-free yield as the Fed kept interest rates so low for so long. The Treasury has used its Exchange Stabilization Fund to float these guarantees, and that makes sense.

What's been missing from all this is any explanation for why this is all needed. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have made token media appearances to proclaim that we should all take heart from everything they are doing. But they offer no diagnosis for the economic problem and their prescriptions aren't clear.

Contrast this with the Fed and Treasury handling of the financial panic in 2008. Whether or not you liked TARP, Secretary Hank Paulson and Chairman Ben Bernanke took ownership of the proposal and explained it to the public and Congress. The federal balance sheet needed to be applied to the banking system to prevent runs and reduce the damage to the larger economy. With some fits and starts, the policy restored confidence in the banking system.

The economic problem this time is very different. Federal and state governments have shut down most of the American economy in an attempt to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. This is creating a liquidity crisis in the real economy as businesses close and companies watch their revenues shrink. Government needs to address the liquidity crisis it has created for private business, or this will soon become a solvency panic as companies default on debt and fail, which will turn into a banking crisis.

If anyone has bothered to explain this to the American public, we haven't heard it. Nor have we heard how the Treasury's proposals, slipped out to the public in a sheet of paper, will address it. The Senate GOP proposal, hashed out with the Treasury, was released on Thursday night as a rough outline with a goal of negotiating a deal with Democratic leader Chuck Schumer by Friday night. Who knows what will emerge from that scrum?

The White House and Treasury should have come up with a plan and then explained what they want and why. Instead, Mr. Mnuchin has turned into a backroom negotiator on Capitol Hill. He looks from our vantage point to be settling for what Congress will accept rather than what needs to be done to rescue the economy from what could become a deep recession.

At least Treasury has come around to realizing it needs a facility to provide liquidity for companies. But as we write this, Mr. Mnuchin was still insisting that Treasury have control of most of the money to be able to ladle out directly to companies it wants to help.

This is a recipe for picking winners and losers, and thus for bitter political fights and months of ugly headlines charging favoritism. The far better answer is for Treasury to use money from Congress to replenish the Exchange Stabilization Fund to back the Fed in creating a facility or special-purpose vehicles under Section 13(3) to lend the money to all comers. The Fed can charge a non-concessionary rate, but the vehicles should be open to those who think they need the money, not merely to those Treasury decides are worthy. The looming liquidity crisis is simply too great for that kind of bureaucratic, politicized decision-making.

We're hoping for the best to emerge from Congress this weekend like white smoke from the Vatican. But whatever they decide, someone will have to do more to explain it to Americans and the markets than wave from the balcony like a new pope.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Mexican Border Crossings Limited

The U.S. and Mexico agreed to curtail travel across their shared 2,000-mile border, allowing trade and workers to continue crossing but limiting most other travelers, including migrants, in response to the coronavirus pandemic.

President Trump announced the move Friday, saying it was necessary to slow the spread of Covid-19, the illness caused by the virus, across North America and ""reduce the mass global migration that would badly deplete the health-care resources needed for our people.""

""Left unchecked, this would cripple our immigration system, overwhelm our health-care system and severely damage our national security,"" Mr. Trump said.

The new restrictions, which mirror for the Canadian border, were set to take effect Friday at midnight. The U.S. has more than 10,000 cases of coronavirus confirmed, and 150 deaths, while Mexico has detected 164 cases and reported one death.

Chad Wolf, the acting Homeland Security secretary, said the administration aims to end casual travel across the border, but will continue to allow essential travel -- including the movement of goods or medical workers. U.S. lawmakers had pressed the administration to permit entry for seasonal workers, many of whom do farm labor and most of whom come from Mexico.

Countries across Europe, Asia and Latin America have shut land borders and reduced international flights. The State Department issued a world-wide Level 4 travel advisory, its highest level, encouraging Americans abroad to return to the U.S. or shelter in place.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that Mexico was discussing whether to stop accepting flights from Europe. Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard at a later news conference said Mexico is opposed to such a measure and that one possible solution is for Mexico to establish restrictions for boarding of inbound flights.

Trump administration officials said that in addition to slowing travel through ports of entry, the government will immediately begin turning back migrants who cross the border illegally, including those claiming asylum, without processing them inside U.S. border patrol stations or detention centers.

Border Patrol agents on Friday had begun quickly turning back Mexican adults after taking fingerprints and processing their information on laptops in the field. The arrested migrants will be repatriated at the nearest port of entry.

Mr. Ebrard has said Mexico would be obliged to take all Mexicans, who he said are the largest nationality trying to reach the U.S. illegally. He also said Mexico will maintain a program that allows mostly Central American asylum seekers to wait in Mexico while their proceedings are adjudicated in the U.S. He said migrants from other nations wouldn't be accepted.

Mexico has already agreed to take more than 60,000 asylum seekers who were sent there while awaiting their U.S. proceedings. Mr. Wolf suggested migrants from other nations would be flown back to their home countries, but didn't say how that would happen amid global travel restrictions.

The U.S. restrictions rely on a provision of public-health law that allows immigration officials to deny entry to foreigners who pose a risk of spreading infectious diseases.

U.S. News: Battered Towns Gearing Up for Flood Season

Corrections & Amplifications

Simon Atadoga attends Minnesota State University in Moorhead, Minn. A U.S. News article on Saturday about communities preparing for flooding season incorrectly said he attends the University of Minnesota.

(WSJ March 23, 2020)

(END)

Volunteers streamed last week into Sandbag Central in Fargo, N.D., where a machine known as the spider can fill up to 120 sandbags a minute. Working in groups of 70, they made and stacked about 232,000 sandbags to prepare for flooding on the Red River of the North.

This year, they had a new addition: hand sanitizer, washing stations and gloves.

Still reeling from last year's historic floods, river cities in the Great Plains and central U.S. are preparing for another active flood season in the middle of the unfolding new coronavirus pandemic.

Last year's flood season, one of the wettest on record, inflicted $20 billion in damage and crop losses across 19 states, according to a recent analysis by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

On Thursday, NOAA issued a new spring flood forecast, which predicted moderate to major flooding in 23 states from the Northern Plains to the Gulf Coast. The most significant flood potential are in parts of North and South Dakota and Minnesota.

Farther south, in Gretna, La., near New Orleans, the pandemic already is approaching a crisis stage. With malls, stores and restaurants closed and hospitals concerned about their capacity to deal with patients in the coming weeks, Mayor Belinda C. Constant said she can only hope the city will have the resources to deal with flooding.

""We're just praying every day that we don't end up in a state of anarchy,"" she said.

While this year's flooding isn't expected to be as dire as last year's, cities are in uncharted territory as they make plans to deal with flooding along with a pandemic that has created a national state of emergency.

Robert Gallagher, mayor of Bettendorf, Iowa, and co-chairman of the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative, said in a press call Thursday that the group of nearly 100 mayors is working together with federal authorities to ensure they have the resources for first responders needed to tackle what he called a double disaster of flooding and Covid-19.

""We have concerns as we move into the possible floods and storms that those first responders will have an increased need for supplies,"" such as masks and full protective gear, he said.

Mr. Gallagher said the coming flood season also would require new protocols at shelters. Those showing signs of the virus will be sheltered separately from the rest of the population, who would be asked to observe social distancing.

Sean Dowse, mayor of Red Wing, Minn., said preparations can go only so far with the uncertainty of the virus.

""Right now, Red Wing is ready for disaster,"" he said. ""We have the personal protective equipment, we have the personnel in place. What will happen in two weeks, we have no idea, because what will come down the road to us could be a surprise and we'll have to be flexible going forward.""

In its Thursday forecast, NOAA said above-average temperatures and precipitation are expected for much of the middle of the country. With soils already saturated, any heavy storms could bring additional flooding.

Areas at greatest risk for major and moderate flooding include the upper and middle Mississippi River basins, the Missouri River basin and the Red River of the North, NOAA said.

On the Missouri River, a mild winter allowed the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to close almost all the levee breaches on the main stem of the river that were opened during a devastating storm in March 2019. One levee was so damaged that the Corps will rebuild it entirely in coming weeks.

Coronavirus won't stop the work. ""It's hard to be more socially distant than a guy in a bulldozer out working on his own,"" said Bret Budd, chief of the Corps' system restoration team.

Grafton, Ill., at the confluence of the Illinois and Mississippi rivers, was one of the hardest hit towns by last year's flooding. This year's less-dire flood forecast offered little comfort to Mayor Rick Eberlin.

""We don't expect the flooding to be as bad as last year,"" he said. ""But with the Covid virus, we think the economic impact will be even worse than last year. Our bars and restaurants are closed. Our town is virtually a ghost town.""

In Fargo, officials are preparing for what could be the fourth-worst flood on record. The current forecast says the Red River has a 10% chance of reaching that level.

Simon Atadoga spent about two hours on his 21st birthday last week shoveling sand into sandbags in the city's Sandbag Central, since all the spots at the spider had been taken by other volunteers.

The Nigerian accounting and business major at the University of Minnesota in Moorhead, just across the river from Fargo, said the work was demanding but it didn't bother him.

""It was a lot of fun,"" he said. ""I did not feel the hard work because I had a lot of conversations and got to meet new people.""

An unparalleled number of Americans filed for unemployment benefits this week as the coronavirus pandemic shut down businesses and left many people without a job, economists say.

State-level anecdotes suggest applications for unemployment benefits -- a proxy for layoffs -- could hit more than 2 million in next Thursday's Labor Department report, the largest weekly increase in jobless claims and the highest level on record, according to a note from Goldman Sachs.

A panel of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal projected that 875,000 new jobless claims would be filed for the week ending Saturday. That would easily exceed the record 695,000 claims filed in the week ended Oct. 2, 1982.

Claims had been trending near a 50-year low for the past 12 months. In the week ended March 7, 211,000 new claims were filed. Last week, the figure rose to 281,000.

States and localities have been ordering businesses, such as restaurants and bars, to temporarily close to protect against the spread of new coronavirus, immediately hitting parts of the economy. A wave of workers rushing to claim unemployment benefits followed, and many states reported the largest increases in claims they have ever seen.

Ohio released updated figures on Friday morning showing jobless claims rose to nearly 140,000 through Thursday, compared with about 5,000 for the same period last week. By noon Thursday, New York's website to register for benefits had about 200,000 logins. The state's Labor Department website is averaging more than 250,000 logins each day, a 400% increase over the normal average.

States continued releasing unemployment-claims figures despite a request from the Trump administration to refrain before the publication of national weekly U.S. jobless claims by the Labor Department on Thursdays.

A Labor Department spokesperson said state data are regularly embargoed until the national numbers are published on Thursday mornings.

Asking states to withhold claims reports ""strikes me as being really unusual,"" said Keith Hall, a Republican economist who served as commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics under President George W. Bush and later as director of the Congressional Budget Office.

Banking regulators in Europe said they would be flexible about how lenders account for loans turning sour due to the coronavirus crisis, to protect banks from burning through capital because of delayed loan repayments.

The move is a relief for lenders, who for days have been lobbying regulators to ease how they recognize potential losses on a new crop of unpaid loans.

The Bank of England and the European Central Bank on Friday indicated banks should consider the virus a temporary shock and take government support measures into account when marking their loan books, rather than taking a worst-case view of its impact.

The ECB said that adding regulatory flexibility will ""allow banks to fully benefit from guarantees and moratoriums put in place by public authorities to tackle the current distress.""

Banks and governments across Europe have announced relief packages for hard-hit households and businesses, allowing them to defer debt payments for a few months.

Some countries, starting with Italy, have imposed a moratorium on certain payment obligations, particularly for mortgage owners and small companies, to ease a liquidity crunch they might be facing. With many countries under a lockdown, shops, restaurants and other businesses have been shut, but they still need to pay bills and workers.

The ECB had already signaled that it would provide some flexibility to banks, including on targets they currently have to meet on writing down nonperforming loans.

EXCHANGE --- The Trade-Off Between Economy and Health --- This isn't the first time we've struggled to strike the balance. Lessons from past crises.

The coronavirus has unleashed a massive economic shock on the U.S. and the world. It began with disruptions to supply chains and restrictions on travel and is now rapidly expanding via spontaneous and government-imposed ""social distancing"" measures such as closing schools and confining regional populations to their homes. Entire industries are shutting down. It is ""a sudden stop to the global economy,"" said Mohamed El-Erian, an adviser to German insurer Allianz.

There is no clear historical precedent for the scale and nature of this shock. Some economists see U.S. output falling by more in the coming quarter than in the worst quarter of the 2008-09 recession. Nonetheless, previous episodes of pandemics, disasters and crises offer clues about what to expect, how policy makers make matters better or worse and the likely long-term consequences.

A few lessons stand out. First, governments and the public always face a trade-off between economic stability and public health and safety. The more they prioritize health and safety, the bigger the near-term cost to the economy, and vice versa.

Second, at the outset of the disaster, policy makers are coping with enormous uncertainty. Early responses are often timid or off-target and more sweeping action is delayed by political disagreement.

""We learned that we need to prioritize speed, think in tranches, be visible and worry about how to pay for it later,"" said Tim Adams, who served in the Treasury Department during 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina and is now president of the Institute of International Finance. ""If you wait to craft the perfect response, you'll lose valuable time and you'll miss something no matter what.""

Third, disasters often create permanent changes to habits, and the most affected industries and regions can take years to recover. New Orleans' population has steadily regained ground since falling by half after Hurricane Katrina but isn't yet back to its prestorm level. But for society as a whole, the scars heal remarkably quickly. Humans are immensely adaptable.

The Spanish Flu

While the coronavirus isn't a flu virus, the pandemic resembles the influenza pandemics of the 20th century, in that it is highly infectious and relatively lethal. The deadliest was the Spanish flu in 1918, which infected at least 500 million people world-wide (more than a quarter of the Earth's population) and killed 50 million or more, including 675,000 in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Yet the economic impact was surprisingly mild. The National Bureau of Economic Research says a recession began in August 1918 and ran through the next March. The flu probably wasn't the cause. In a 2006 paper for Canada's Department of Finance, Steven James and Tim Sargent found little trace of the pandemic in international trade, retail sales, railroad passenger traffic and stock prices. They saw some effect on industrial production, which fell sharply in October and November but that was in part due to falling defense production as World War I drew to a close. They put the pandemic's effect at a 0.5% decline in annual output.

There are likely several reasons. Far fewer people worked in jobs that required close social contact. Farming, fishing and forestry accounted for 16% of American occupations in 1910 compared with 0.3% in 2004, according to Messrs. James and Sargent. Few workers had sick leave, and unemployment insurance didn't exist. Thus, workers who were sick or at risk could seldom afford to stay home.

The second is that governments, many preoccupied with war, didn't put the same weight on stopping the epidemic as they do now. The federal government had little formal role fighting infectious disease. President Woodrow Wilson never publicly mentioned the epidemic, John Barry writes in ""The Great Influenza: The Story of the Deadliest Pandemic in History."" Chicago's public health commissioner flatly rejected closing businesses, Mr. Barry wrote, quoting him as saying: ""It is our duty to keep the people from fear. Worry kills more people than the epidemic.""

Cities that took that attitude saw higher death tolls, according to a2007 study by Richard J. Hatchett, Carter E. Mecher, and Marc Lipsitch. Philadelphia waited 16 days before restricting social gatherings, even allowing a parade to go ahead. St. Louis took just two days. The daily death rate from the epidemic peaked at a level five or more times higher in Philadelphia than in St. Louis.

The lesson: The more short-term economic pain Americans are willing to endure, the more lives they will save.

Asian Flu Pandemic

The 1957 Asian flu pandemic killed more than 1 million world-wide and 100,000 in the U.S., although some estimates are lower. It emerged in China in February, reached the U.S. in early June and then spread explosively when schools opened in September. On Oct. 7, 43% of Manhattan students and 11% of teachers were absent because of illness, and by the end of October, more than half of all counties nationwide were experiencing epidemics, according to a study bythe Center for Biosecurity of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.

As in 1918, the pandemic coincided with a recession, but that was because the Federal Reserve had been raising interest rates to counter rising inflation. Messrs. James and Sargent found a ""very small"" impact from the epidemic on growth, mostly from absenteeism.

Also as in 1918, the lack of widespread social distancing may explain why the epidemic had so little economic impact. State and federal officials made vaccination, which was unavailable in 1918, their first line of defense. But only enough vaccine for 17% of the population had been produced by the time the epidemic peaked, and it was at most 60% effective, so it did little to mitigate the pandemic, the Pittsburgh study found. The authorities rejected social distancing, most schools remained open and many people weren't sick enough to require hospitalization.

The 1957, 1968 and 2009 flu pandemics were highly contagious but much less lethal than the Spanish flu and, it appears, Covid-19. Those experiences may have contributed to initial public complacency over the coronavirus. Governments are now willing to take far more economically disruptive remedies than in those prior episodes.

September 11 Attack

When al Qaeda terrorists flew jetliners into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, they delivered an unprecedented shock to the nation's sense of security and its economy. Commercial aviation was grounded for three days. The destruction to lower Manhattan closed the stock markets. Heightened security slowed trade with Canada and Mexico to a crawl. Nervous shoppers stayed away from stores and malls.

Economists predicted the attacks would tip a slowing economy into recession. People would be more reluctant to fly, work in a tall building or base their office in New York City.

But the U.S. bounced back remarkably quickly. It was later determined that a recession triggered by the technology bust had begun six months before the attacks and ended two months afterward.

One reason was the aggressive policy response. The day the markets reopened, the Fed and its counterparts in the eurozone, Canada and Sweden all slashed rates. Low rates inspired auto manufacturers to roll out zero percent financing, sending sales skyrocketing. Fears of terrorism faded when new attacks didn't materialize.

Within two weeks Congress approved $40 billion for emergency rebuilding and defense and $5 billion in cash assistance and up to $10 billion in loan guarantees to airlines. Both parties agreed more stimulus was needed but negotiations soon bogged down over its composition. When a package worth $51 billion over one year and $94 billion over five years finally passed in March, a recovery was already well under way.

The lessons for the present go only so far. Back then, Americans were urged to defeat al Qaeda by continuing to work, play and shop. Today, they are being urged to defeat the coronavirus by staying home. Then, interest rates were high enough that zero-interest car loans seemed like the deal of the century. Not anymore. Then, the shock was confined to the U.S. and short-lived; today, it is global and could last weeks or months, so no one can expect overseas strength to cushion their downturn.

Still American resilience prevailed. People quickly adjusted to heightened security. Airline traffic and demand for New York office space returned to their pre-attack levels over the next several years.

SARS in Hong Kong

Hong Kong's experience with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 was a dress rehearsal for the coronavirus. The virus first appeared in China, which tried to cover it up and then had to resort to drastic quarantines to quash it. It probably entered Hong Kong via a Chinese doctor who checked into a hotel there in February 2003.

Initially, the government played down the outbreak. By late March it broke out in an apartment complex and as news spread, social distancing arose almost spontaneously.

""Fears of the SARS virus took root in the whole city,"" Alan Siu and Y.C. Richard Wong, economists at the University of Hong Kong, wrote in a 2004 article. ""Face masks were selling briskly and could be seen everywhere. Public places were disinfected several times a day. People washed their hands much more frequently and avoided going out to crowded places. Restaurants, shops, cinemas, and other entertainment venues were deserted.""

The government eventually closed the schools and ordered anyone confirmed or suspected of SARS to self-isolate.

SARS sent the economy, with its dependence on travel and tourism, reeling. Between March and May, daily passenger arrivals and departures plummeted 80% while the hotel occupancy rate plunged from 80% to below 20%, Messrs. Siu and Wong reported. Unemployment jumped and gross domestic product shrank in the second quarter.

The social distancing had its desired effect: The breakout was contained by late April. The economy bounced back rapidly, without significant direct government support.

SARS's most important lesson for the coronavirus episode is the imprint it left on the collective psyche. When new epidemics emerge, Hong Kong's airport is quick to check arriving passengers' temperatures. Shortly after the territory reported its first coronavirus cases in late January, it moved to restrict travel from mainland China and closed schools, government offices, major tourist attractions, libraries and swimming pools. Surgical masks became ubiquitous, which, like mass vaccination, helped prevent infectious people from spreading the disease.

So far, that has held infections down. Nonetheless, the economic fallout has been just as bad as in 2003. The government has responded with significant fiscal stimulus.

The Last Financial Crisis

The 2008-2009 financial crisis wasn't a natural disaster, and didn't directly kill anyone. Yet like the coronavirus, it began as an isolated shock that soon engulfed the global economy and forced policy makers to respond creatively.

At first, the Fed lowered interest rates, and encouraged banks to borrow from its discount window. In early 2008, President Bush and Congress authorized $168 billion to send $600 checks to most individuals.

By March the crisis reached the core of the financial system. The Fed and Treasury bailed out Bear Stearns using emergency authority. That September, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt. Then, the Fed and Treasury bailed out Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the insurer American International Group. After the stock market cratered, Congress approved the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, which the Treasury used to inject funds into banks, securities markets and car companies. In early 2009, newly elected President Obama ushered through a $787 billion fiscal stimulus plan.

The financial crisis caused the worst recession since the Great Depression but thanks to the Fed, TARP and stimulus, it didn't become another depression. It also left policy makers with a reservoir of tools and tactics that they are now resurrecting.

The crisis also left a legacy of deeply divided politics. Though TARP turned a profit for the government, much of the public saw it as a bailout for the very people who caused the crisis, sentiments which gave rise to the Tea Party on the right and Occupy Wall Street on the left. Those views persist, which President Trump and both parties in Congress must navigate as they contemplate bailouts and other measures to combat a new shock that some say is on a par with the financial crisis.

Earthquake and Tsunami

The earthquake and accompanying tsunami that struck Japan's Tohoku region in March 2011 left 19,000 people dead or missing and triggered a meltdown at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. Swiss Re ranks it the costliest natural disaster in history, at $239 billion. The region supplied intermediate parts to manufacturers and the resulting shortage in parts caused the shutdown of plants around the world.

The initial economic response was typical of disasters: The Japanese government spent heavily on rescue and reconstruction, which helped propel a recovery in the economy. The government poured resources into rebuilding the region with the result that its manufacturing production had recovered to its pre-disaster level by 2014.

Hiroyuki Nakata, an economist at the University of Tokyo, says the response worked as intended in the short term, but less well over the long run. ""The size of the package may well have been too big -- the subsidies let zombie companies survive.""

Responding to public fear of radiation, Japan took all of its nuclear generators off line over the next few years. Nuclear power's contribution to Japanese electricity generation sank from 25% in 2010 to 5% in 2018. Whether this was scientifically justifiable is questionable. A study by academics Matthew J. Neidell, Shinsuke Uchida and Marcella Veronesi last year found the resulting rise in electricity prices led to less home heating in cold weather, causing 1,280 deaths from 2011-2014. Yet they note no direct deaths have been attributed to radiation exposure, though they cite projections that radiation will eventually cause 130 deaths from cancer.

The disaster illustrates the tensions between balancing the public's legitimate aversion to harm against the known consequences and likely economic costs. Until recently, the coronavirus seemed to present the opposite risk: The public wasn't taking the threat seriously enough, forcing the government to take more disruptive steps, to limit human interaction, while seeking to offset the resulting economic cost through fiscal and monetary policy.

As in all these past disasters, the coronavirus pandemic confronts governments, business and the public with crippling uncertainty and painful trade-offs. The main difference is that this is on a scale and breadth never seen in living memory.

Repression in the Time of Coronavirus

Given the credibility that President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden lent to Cuban propaganda while they were in office, I half-expected to see them enjoying spring break in Varadero Beach last week.

The regime said Friday it will close its borders to foreigners starting March 24. But until now Havana has been trying to make lemonade out of the coronavirus by advertising Cuban holidays as an escape from the pandemic. The independent Cuban news outlet 14ymedio reported last week that regime tour companies were boasting about the island's state-of-the-art health-care system, saying it's capable of taking on the contagious virus. This is known as being hard up for hard currency.

Cuba already has been denounced for treating its medical workers like chattel when it sends them abroad to earn money for the regime and indoctrinate populations. But now it's doubling down on the scheme, claiming that Havana is stepping up to help the world in a time of crisis.

It also maintains it makes magic in its pharmaceutical labs. Doctors around the world have long relied on interferon as an immune-system booster for treating viral infections and other illnesses. But now Cuba is using its army of global influencers to promote claims that its production of a type of the drug is the cutting-edge of science.

Italian tourists have experienced a different reality. A 61-year-old from the Lombardy region of Italy died of the virus on Wednesday at Havana's Pedro Kuri Institute for Tropical Diseases, one of the island's best hospitals. Another Italian corona patient, confined in the same facility, complained bitterly on social media about no toilet paper, no spoons for soup, no news about her condition and no communication with doctors.

In a country where soap and water are luxuries, ramping up traffic from Europe was a precarious strategy. But desperate times spawn crackpot measures, and the Cuban economy is skating dangerously close to the edge. The regime needs dollars to maintain the police state that has kept it in power for six decades. Its problem today, in a word, is oil.

Cuba hasn't done well on its own since Fidel Castro took power in 1959. It was a dependent of the Soviet Union until 1991. Havana was then forced to legalize the dollar and microenterprises and let foreign investors take minority stakes in regime companies. But the ruling elite didn't like it.

The Castros found a new sugar daddy in Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, who came to power in 1999. A symbiotic relationship blossomed: Cuba would exchange its comparative advantage in repression for Venezuelan petroleum products. At the deal's peak, from 2010-12, Havana received some $4 billion annually in oil subsidies from Venezuela.

But the party wasn't to last. Venezuela was pumping 3.4 million barrels a day before chavismo. Output is now around 750,000 barrels a day -- and falling -- thanks to poor well management, a scarcity of skilled labor and a collapse of investment.

Caracas has been eating big discounts because it's difficult for buyers to get around U.S. sanctions. Russia's Rosneft, formerly Venezuela's key customer, is said to be put off by all that effort. Other former buyers can get heavy crude more easily from Saudi Arabia. With the international oil-price swoon, tar-heavy Venezuelan crude has plummeted to between $10 and $15 a barrel.

Venezuelan storage capacity on land and at sea is full up, so it is sending the excess to Cuba. This has boosted daily shipments back to 100,000 barrels a day from lows of around 20,000 before fall 2019. The Castro regime has been filling its storage tanks and selling what it can on the black market.

Yet more than crude, Havana needs gasoline, diesel and gas oil for electricity production, which Venezuela used to provide but no longer has the infrastructure to produce. Venezuela resorts to swaps when it can, but the terms are terrible. So despite the uptick in crude supplies, Cuba is still limping badly.

Meanwhile the effects of the coronavirus shutdown ""are likely to be catastrophic for Venezuela,"" Francisco Monaldi, an energy economist at Rice University, told me in a telephone interview last week. Running water and soap aren't readily available in hospitals or even in many homes. Gasoline shortages make getting imported food to cities outside the capital difficult. Venezuela is heavily dependent on some $3 billion in annual remittances from citizens who fled, mostly to other South American countries, in recent years. If their jobs dry up in a deep regional recession, so will the flow of money. This will put more pressure on Venezuelan leadership to end subsidies to Cuba.

What's more, it may be necessary to cap wells, and that's unlikely to be temporary. Experts say it won't be easy to restart them when human and financial capital is in short supply.

All this explains Havana's efforts to use the pandemic to boost European tourism and to create the illusion that it specializes in advanced medical care. It's a sick joke.

Samsung Rising

By Geoffrey Cain

(Currency, 391 pages, $29)

Geoffrey Cain's ""Samsung Rising"" reads like a dynastic thriller, rolling through three generations of family intrigue, embezzlement, bribery, corruption, prostitution and other bad behavior that seems to pass for standard operating procedure in the Korean business world. More than half of the country's 10 largest corporate groups, Mr. Cain tells us, are led by convicted criminals, although all of them have received presidential pardons, and several of them, including Samsung's current chairman, Lee Kun-hee, have been pardoned twice.

The Korean national spy agency works with Samsung, Samsung works with the government, and everyone makes out well in the virtuous circle of cross-shareholding known as the Republic of Samsung. In the meantime, South Korea's most valuable company, a $300 billion behemoth that accounts for a fifth of the country's exports, keeps inventing new products that we gobble up by the millions.

""Samsung is the most bizarro place I've ever seen,"" says a former American executive at the company. Mr. Cain notes the irony that the most prominent company in South Korea is infused with the nationalism and militaristic structure of the North. The company is run by a revered leader whose messages are broadcast throughout its factories and reproduced in everything from comic books to a Samsung-owned newspaper. During the company's annual summer festival, Mr. Cain writes, drill teams line up to form a punching fist and raise placards spelling out the word ""Victory"" -- just like their northern cousins do.

Like many stories about successful entrepreneurs, Samsung's begins with a young man dropping out of college. Lee Byung-chul, also known as B.C. Lee, founded Samsung in 1938, in what was then a Japanese colony. He failed at trading rice before moving into fresh vegetables and dried fish. As a university student in Tokyo, Lee had admired how the Japanese did business through zaibatsu -- interconnected corporate cliques with strong ties to the military and state. Lee borrowed this structure to develop what became known in Korea as chaebols.

Lee drew on family resources to build a sugar refinery. He moved into trucking, wool spinning and insurance. He started a university and a newspaper. By the time he died in 1987, he was the richest man in South Korea and a ""symbol of South Korean corruption,"" says Mr. Cain, for having bribed his way into obtaining a wide variety of state-controlled licenses and contracts.

In November 1983, Chairman Lee welcomed into one of his factories in Suwon, a grimy, industrial city south of Seoul, a 28-year-old American entrepreneur named Steve Jobs. Dreaming about building a tablet computer, Jobs was looking for memory chips and displays. Samsung at the time was making cut-rate TVs and microwaves, but it was also getting started in making memory chips, and Jobs suspected they could build anything he wanted. He and Lee hit it off, and Samsung would eventually become the major supplier of computer chips, displays and other components used in Apple's iPads and smartphones.

Before his death, Lee handed the company to his third son, Lee Kun-hee, or K.H. Lee. Lee Kun-hee was a playboy better known for having a private race track for his Porsches until one day in 1993 when he had a kind of corporate epiphany. Gathering the company's top executives into the presidential suite at the Kempinski Hotel in Frankfurt, where he was living at the time, Lee delivered an eight-hour speech and urged them to ""change everything except your wife and children"" and embrace Samsung's new philosophy of ""perpetual crisis.""

Samsung's ""quasi-religious corporate culture,"" as Mr. Cain calls it, began opening to the West. Samsung imported Madison Avenue advertising executives, California designers and Texas marketers. It launched Hollywood initiatives to improve the company's dismal image. The company began shifting from electronics to software and lifestyle. In this world of interchangeable technology, where one cellphone works pretty much like any other, design becomes the product itself.

Samsung went through a dark period in the late 1990s. Asian markets collapsed in 1997, Samsung Motors went bust and Lee Kun-hee was convicted of making $32 million in ""donations"" to government officials. To bring in cash, Samsung began selling flip phones in bulk to Sprint and other carriers. This is when the sales and marketing people in Richardson, Texas, began attending corporate meetings that were ""more like a Communist Party self-criticism session,"" as Mr. Cain puts it. The company was so driven by ""fear of failure and loss of face"" that good sales figures in the U.S. were thought to reflect badly on bosses back in Korea.

By 2010, the year before his death, Jobs was threatening ""thermonuclear war"" on Android, the operating system used by Samsung's phones. Furious that a major supplier was releasing its own competing products, Jobs launched one of the longest-running patent-infringement suits in corporate history, which ended seven years later in a legal draw, with Apple winning in the U.S. courts and Samsung winning in Korea, Japan and England.

By this point in the story, Mr. Cain's wonderfully informative book begins to fray into anecdotes about various product launches and celebrities pouting over promotional tie-ins. With Samsung shipping 85 million smartphones a quarter, it could buy endorsements from Jay-Z, Kanye, Ellen DeGeneres or anyone else.

Lee Kun-hee has not been seen in public since he suffered a heart attack in 2014. His son, Lee Jae-yong, is tapped to succeed his father, but the family is a minority shareholder in Samsung's 50 companies -- or is it 60 or more, as some sources say? -- and Lee Jae-yong may not be able to summon the alliances required to keep this sprawling enterprise in family hands. He and his sisters are also facing more than $6 billion in estate taxes, not to mention his own five-year prison sentence for bribery and embezzlement, which is currently being appealed. Stay tuned for the next installment in this long-running drama.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Germany Outlines Emergency Budget

BERLIN -- The German government is set to adopt fiscal measures of as much as 500 billion euros ($534.9 billion) to help shield Europe's largest economy from the fallout of the pandemic.

Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who serves as Germany's vice chancellor, will preside over the cabinet meeting on Monday that will draft an emergency budget, officials said, which could be approved by Parliament as early as Wednesday.

The new budget would allow the government to raise borrowing to the tune of 150 billion euros this year and include several hundred billion euros more in loan guarantees to help businesses secure liquidity amid a coronavirus shutdown.

The package would cause the federal government to post a budget deficit for the first time since 2014, in a stark reversal of its longstanding policy of fiscal restraint.

The series of bills could even allow the German government to increase its liabilities beyond the 500 billion euro mark if the country's shutdown extends for longer or causes a sharper downturn than currently expected.

An estimate by Deutsche Bank last week showed the country's gross domestic product could fall by as much as a quarter in the three months to the end of June.

The move comes after the German government last week ordered all nonessential businesses to close to help limit contagion, and large industrial companies such as the car makers Volkswagen AG and BMW AG closed their factories.

On Sunday, Chancellor Angela Merkel announced a tightening of these measures, including a ban of public gatherings of more than two people, with the exemption of families and people who live in the same household.

Virus Remakes Economic Policy --- Crisis creates consensus favoring bold fiscal moves

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

The coronavirus crisis has turned into the biggest threat to the global economy at least since 2008. The big difference this time around is that a surprising consensus has emerged about what to do about it.

Indeed, the specific characteristics of the Covid-19 outbreak give it the power to change economic policy forever.

Last week, even the previously cautious European Central Bank U-turned, launching a 750 billion euro ($809 billion) stimulus program that includes the bold possibility of backstopping the eurozone's weakest governments. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve has deployed all the tools developed during the liquidity crunch 12 years ago -- including facilities to support banks and companies and currency swaps with other central banks.

Crucially, this comes amid a wave of spending pledges by governments -- the biggest shift in economic policy since the 1970s, when fiscal stimulus was abandoned as a primary tool to stabilize employment. According to UBS economist Arend Kapteyn, fiscal expansion globally will amount to about 2% of gross domestic product this year, versus 1.7% in 2009.

The plans include ideas considered fringe not long ago: The Trump administration wants to mail $250 billion in checks to Americans. Economists are even putting forward heterodox proposals like having central banks print such checks -- so-called helicopter money -- and giving everyone a basic income.

Arguably, the coronavirus cash crunch isn't nearly as strong a challenge to officials' understanding of economics as 2008 was. Yet the global financial crisis only truly shifted the reach of what central banks could do, not governments. With the International Monetary Fund still embracing theories of ""expansionary austerity,"" the Obama administration's stimulus package met with fierce opposition.

Now, almost all officials and economists seem united in pushing for a new mind-set. What has changed?

Part of it has been brewing for a decade, in which neither inflation nor huge public debts have proved to be the problem that fiscal hawks feared -- dispelling the idea that currency-printing Western governments can ever go bust. Even before the virus hit, President Trump in the U.S. and Prime Minister Boris Johnson in the U.K. had put the lid on austerity policies.

But the change also has to do with what Polish economist Michal Kalecki wrote in his famous 1943 essay ""Political Aspects of Full Employment:"" A reason why subsidizing consumers is resisted by businesses against their own self-interest is because it goes against the moral principle of ""you shall earn your bread in sweat."" The coronavirus crisis is special, though, in that it is an external, amoral force that has hit the ""real"" economy first. Damage to financial markets and indebted consumers -- two groups often seen as suspect by business leaders -- has been a consequence of the crisis, not its cause as in 2008.

To be sure, the announced fiscal stimulus may still not be enough, especially in Europe. There is a risk of replicating the sluggish 2008 postcrisis period if businesses and officials don't back a second round of government support to fight unemployment once the immediate impact on companies is left behind.

On the record of the last two weeks, though, policy makers are suddenly eager to act. Post-1970s economics was already suffering from pre-existing conditions; Covid-19 could be what sends the old orthodoxy to the grave.

U.S. Prosecutors Step Up Pressure on Maduro Regime

The U.S. quietly unsealed criminal cases against two former officials at Venezuela's state oil monopoly this month as part of what American officials say is a new round of charges and sanctions against a Maduro government they accuse of systemic corruption, narcotrafficking and stealing billions of dollars in state funds.

Prosecutors have also charged a businessman associated with the subsidiary of the company, Petroleos de Venezuela, SA (PdVSA), for which the officials worked.

Some of the actions have been delayed in part by the coronavirus pandemic. But senior U.S. officials say they are part of a Trump administration effort to double down on its pressure campaign against President Nicolas Maduro's government after failing to deliver on its primary goal of ousting the regime.

Federal prosecutors in Miami, New York and Washington, D.C., are targeting what they allege is vast corruption in the country's beleaguered petroleum sector and currency markets, state-aided narcotrafficking, and money-laundering through Venezuela's military-run emergency food program.

They have charged dozens of defendants -- many of whom have pleaded guilty in U.S. courts -- and are continuing to probe alleged bribery and money laundering involving joint ventures with PdVSA, according to court documents and people familiar with the matter.

On Friday, Miami prosecutors charged Leonardo Santilli, a Venezuelan citizen who controlled several companies working for the joint ventures, with money laundering in Miami and related offenses.

Mr. Santilli's companies allegedly received nearly $150 million from the PdVSA subsidiaries between 2014-2017, according to court documents. More than $100 million of that was allegedly transferred to accounts, trusts and shell companies controlled by him and other Venezuelan individuals, prosecutors allege.

Mr. Santilli allegedly used millions of the funds to bribe senior officials in the Venezuelan military and government on behalf of the joint ventures, according to the court documents, which also allege that employees at Mr. Santilli's companies tracked the payments in a spreadsheet, callingthe transactions ""comisiones,"" or commissions.

Mr. Santilli couldn't be reached to comment. Venezuelan officials didn't respond to a request for comment.

This month, federal judges in Miami also unsealed charges against two state-oil company executives at one the of subsidiaries Mr. Santilli allegedly received money from, Lennys Rangel and Edoardo Orsoni. Both worked at Petrocedeno, a joint venture between PdVSA and French oil giant Total SA and Norway's Equinor ASA. Representatives for Equinor and Total didn't respond to requests for comment.

An attorney for Ms. Rangel didn't respond to a request for comment. An attorney for Mr. Orsoni declined to comment.

U.S. News: Inmates Freed in Bid to Curb the Outbreak

Local governments across the U.S. are releasing thousands of inmates in an unprecedented effort to prevent a coronavirus outbreak in crowded jails and prisons.

Jails in California, New York, Ohio, Texas and at least a dozen other states are sending low-level offenders and elderly or sickly inmates home early due to coronavirus fears. At other jails and prisons around the country, officials are banning visitors, restricting inmates' movement and screening staff.

The 2.2 million people behind bars in the country, and the guards who work with them, face unique risks due to the tight spaces in crowded conditions and strained health-care systems, according to experts.

""We're all headed for some dire consequences,"" said Daniel Vasquez, a former warden of San Quentin and Soledad state prisons in California. ""They're in such close quarters -- some double- and triple-celled -- I think it's going to be impossible to stop it from spreading.""

Prison staff in Pennsylvania, Michigan, New York and Washington state have tested positive for the virus, resulting in inmate quarantines. In Washington, D.C., a U.S. marshal who works in proximity to new arrestees tested positive for the virus, meaning dozens of defendants headed for jail could have been exposed. Two federal prison staffers have also tested positive.

On Saturday, the first federal inmate tested positive in a Brooklyn, N.Y., facility, according to the Bureau of Prisons. The same day, New York City's Board of Correction, an independent oversight agency, sent a letter to city and state officials urging them to rapidly reduce the jail population, with a focus on people at highest risk of infection, pointing to more than 30 inmates and corrections employees who have tested positive for the virus.

There have been no reported major outbreaks yet, but experts fear thecoronavirus could overwhelm correctional facilities, particularly because there are more inmates than ever in the older demographic that is at greater risk. The number of people 55 or older in state and federal prisons reached 164,000 in 2016, more than tripling from 1999, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts.

""Will they have the staff, the equipment, and the service to treat people?"" asked Steve J. Martin, a corrections consultant who serves as a federal monitor for the Rikers Island jail complex in New York City. ""And if they don't, are they going to send those folks out to hospitals or where they can get adequate health care?""

To prevent the virus from spreading, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests separating symptomatic individuals. In correctional facilities, however, that can be ""virtually impossible,"" according to Homer Venters, former chief medical officer for New York City correctional health services.

Many jails and prisons already need to separate numerous types of inmates, he noted, including pretrial and sentenced individuals, men and women, migrant detainees and the mentally ill.

Amy Fettig, deputy director at the American Civil Liberties Union's National Prison Project, said authorities should balance public safety with civil rights, such as access to libraries and recreation, as well as visits with family. ""If civil rights are abrogated, it should be based on science and revisited frequently,"" she said.

Some public-health officials and prisoners' rights advocates have proposed large-scale releases of the incarcerated. In Iran, 54,000 prisoners have been temporarily released to slow the spread of the virus.

In Cleveland, more than 400 inmates have been moved out of the Cuyahoga County Jail via lowered bonds or quickly reached plea deals, resulting in release or transfer to state prison. Judges and prosecutors sought to reassure the public that the nearly 25% reduction in the county jail population didn't mean they were releasing inmates en masse.

""We're not opening up the jail doors and letting prisoners leave,"" said Brendan Sheehan, administrative judge of the Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court. ""We're looking at lower-level nonviolent felons and we're looking at our jail cases who have a higher medical risk.""

The goal is to keep inmates further apart and create space for quarantines if necessary, he said.

Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva said he has reduced the jail population from 17,076 to 16,459 since the end of February by asking police to cite and release low-level offenders and by releasing inmates with fewer than 30 days left on their sentences. Arrests in the county -- the most populous in the U.S. -- have dropped to 60 a day from around 300, he said.

""Our population within the jail is a vulnerable population just by virtue of who they are and where they're located,"" Sheriff Villanueva said at a Monday press conference. ""We're protecting that population from potential exposure.""

Heard on the Street
Tobacco's Resilience Is a Temptation

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

It is a dark irony that a respiratory pandemic could pull tobacco stocks out of their three-year funk.

British American Tobacco reiterated its 2020 outlook last week even as many other global companies slashed theirs. The maker of Lucky Strike cigarettes has been largely untouched by the Covid-19 outbreak so far, other than a hit to airports sales.

Cigarette companies have been resilient in previous economic downturns. One study of the 2008 financial crisis by international cancer institute IRCCS found no significant change in U.S. smoking prevalence between 2005 and 2010.

Cigarette stocks were a good place to shelter during the financial crisis. The S&P 500 index dropped 47% from October 2007 through January 2009, roughly double the declines at BAT and Altria.

But investors don't seem to believe that tobacco companies will be as defensive this time. Since the stock market selloff began in the third week of February, global cigarette makers BAT, Imperial Brands, Philip Morris International and Altria have, on average, seen their shares fall roughly in line with the S&P 500.

That may be because sentiment toward cigarette stocks has been exceptionally weak since mid-2017, when U.S. authorities toughened regulations. Or perhaps investors may believe that smokers have a greater incentive than ever to quit given the crisis.

Early signs are that demand for tobacco is stable. In the U.S., the number of cigarettes sold in the four weeks through Feb. 22 fell 3.5% year-over-year, according to data from MSAi, an improvement on steeper declines throughout 2019. True, the latest data predates the rapid escalation in cases in the U.S. of Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. But BAT has also seen no slowdown in purchases in Italy or France, where tobacconists are among the only stores that remain open, alongside supermarkets and pharmacies.

If that trend holds, tobacco's temptations will grow for investors. Valuations are low: Altria and BAT fetch earnings multiples last seen in the early 2000s, when investors worried the tobacco industry would be bankrupted by litigation. Imperial Brands is even cheaper. Average dividend yields are 10%, and high cash generation suggests payouts are safe, except at Imperial where a new chief executive is taking over.

Tobacco names won't be immune to short-term manufacturing and staffing disruptions due to the epidemic. On Thursday, Altria said its chief executive had contracted Covid-19 and is taking medical leave. The company has also closed its Richmond factory after an employee tested positive, but says it has two months of inventory stockpiled.

By far the biggest challenge for business during the pandemic is turning out to be the drop off in sales due to social distancing. With their antisocial products, cigarette companies may be among the few to escape relatively unscathed.

Marines Will Retool, With an Eye to China

By Michael R. Gordon

The Marine Corps is undertaking its most sweeping transformation in decades, pivoting from a focus on fighting insurgents in the Middle East to developing the ability to hop from island to island in the western Pacific to bottle up the Chinese fleet.

The 10-year plan to revamp the Corps, set to be unveiled this week, follows years of classified U.S. wargames that revealed China's missile and naval forces to be eroding American military advantages in the region.

""China, in terms of military capability, is the pacing threat,"" Gen. David Berger, the Marine Corps commandant, said in an interview. ""If we did nothing, we would be passed.""

To reinvent themselves as a naval expeditionary force within budget limits, the Marines plan to get rid of all tanks, cut back on their aircraft and shrink in total numbers from 189,000 to as few as 170,000, Gen. Berger said.

""I have come to the conclusion that we need to contract the size of the Marine Corps to get quality,"" he said.

The changes are part of a shift by all branches of the armed forces, which are honing new fighting concepts and planning to spend billions of dollars on what the Pentagon projects will be intensified competition with China and Russia.

Nearly 20 years ago, U.S. troops found themselves battling militants in Iraq and Afghanistan who used suicide car bombs and roadside explosives but had no air force or heavy mechanized forces.

While the U.S. focused on the Middle East, however, China and Russia worked on systems to thwart the American ability to assemble forces near their regions and command them in battle. If war broke out, U.S. officials concluded, China could fire hundreds of missiles at U.S. and allies' air bases, ports and command centers throughout the Pacific, jam the U.S. military's GPS, attack satellite systems and use its air defenses to keep U.S. warplanes at bay.

A sobering assessment of how U.S. forces would match up against rivals was prepared by the Pentagon's Office of Net Assessment and the Rand Corp. and presented to then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in 2017.

The new strategy faces some significant obstacles. One is that the defense budget is more likely to stay flat or contract over the next several years. Another question is whether Washington will be able to concentrate on the Chinese and Russian threats given persistent tensions with Iran.

Some retired Marines caution that too heavy a focus on China may make the Corps less flexible in dealing with conflicts that might erupt in the Middle East. ""I think it is a mistake to organize yourself in a way to go after a specific region,"" said Anthony Zinni, a retired four-star Marine general who led the Central Command.

At the heart of Gen. Berger's plan is the establishment of naval expeditionary units -- what the Marines call ""littoral regiments"" -- whose mission would be to take on the Chinese navy.

If a confrontation loomed, the regiments would disperse small teams of Marines, who would rush in sleek landing craft to the tiny islands that dot the South and East China Seas, according to Gen. Berger and other senior Marine officers. Armed with sensor-laden drones that operate in the air, on the sea and underwater, the Marines would target Chinese warships before they ventured into the wider Pacific.

The Marine teams would fire antiship missiles at the Chinese fleet. Targeting data also would be passed to Air Force or Navy units farther away, which would fire longer-range missiles.

To elude retaliatory blows, the Marines would hop from island to island every 48 or 72 hours, relying on amphibious ships that could be piloted remotely. Other Marine teams would operate from U.S. warships with decoy vessels nearby.

Gen. Berger said the wargames showed that the new Marine capabilities and tactics would create ""a ton of problems"" for the Chinese forces.

The Marines would deploy new missile batteries, drone units and amphibious ships. A major push is being made to ease the logistical burden, such as exploring the use of 3-D printing on the battlefield to make spare parts. The strategy requires deeper integration with the Navy, and Marine teams might perform other missions like refueling submarines or sub-hunting planes.

To fund the capabilities, the Marines will dispense with all tanks over the next few years, eliminate its bridge-laying companies and cut back on aviation and howitzers.

Gen. Berger said that adjusting over the next 10 to 20 years is part of the plan, and that the Marines are proceeding with ""the cleared-eyed view that the threat is moving also.""

On Business: Boardrooms Could Use A Few More Insiders

In late 2008, with financial panic gripping the economy and automobile demand evaporating, General Motors Co.'s board met three times a week. The car company's health was failing as executives tweaked forecasts daily. The job of pressing executives for a realistic rescue plan fell to 12 independent directors.

This type of boardroom triage was common during the Great Recession, after the dot-com bubble burst and in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks. Plenty of vulnerable businesses went the way of GM, filing for chapter 11 or going belly up. The survivors gripped the wheel hard and steered sharp, capitalized on rivals' misfortunes or simply got lucky.

As the new coronavirus wreaks havoc on U.S. corporations, and entire industries teeter, it is fair to ask how prepared today's boardrooms are. I would argue that a movement that was designed to make boards better may instead leave some of them flat-footed as their companies face this crisis.

The culling of the ultimate boardroom insider has taken place over the past couple decades without much fanfare, as investment advisers and governance experts made war on the ""overboarded"" director.

These are the directors who held a half-dozen or so public board seats at the same time. Some companies sought out such people to fill their directors' chairs, believing their broad perspective on a multitude of industries and companies made them experts on best and worst practices.

Detractors say these directors are overworked, and advance the old-boys' network at a time when diversity is top priority. If a director simply bounces from boardroom to boardroom, can they really focus on the specific needs of a troubled firm? And, if the same people keep getting tapped for new board openings, how will younger prospects with fresh ideas get a shot?

""The reason there are concerns about overboarding is exactly times like these,"" said Rusty O'Kelley, co-leader of Russell Reynolds Associates's Board & CEO advisory. ""It may be easy to juggle multiple boards when times are going well, but what happens when too many board seats and other commitments get in the way?""

Jerry Davis, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, recently published a paper called ""Who Killed the Inner Circle?"" that reflects decades of research. He estimated there were at least 90 directors serving on five or more corporate boards of major U.S. companies in 1974. The number fell to 75 in 1994. By 2012, Shirley Jackson, then the president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, was the lone ultra-insider at a major firm.

""The inner circle has vanished,"" Mr. Davis said. As a result, the amount of shared insights among corporations is shrinking with it. He notes JPMorgan Chase & Co. once was connected to 48 different companies via its directors' various affiliations; today that number is nine.

These affiliations have proved invaluable in past times of crisis. When GM was skidding toward bankruptcy, Ford Motor Co. relied on a longtime board member with deep connections and multiple board seats -- ex-Goldman Sachs Group Inc. President John Thornton -- to help it survive its own liquidity crisis. Mr. Thornton remains on Ford's board as its longest-serving director.

""I think there is this simplistic notion out there saying that sitting on many boards is a bad thing,"" said Alexander Ljungqvist, a professor at the Stockholm School of Economics and a director at a Swedish pension fund. ""This ignores the fact that there is a trade-off between a breadth of experiences and connections, and a limited attention.""

Mr. Ljungqvist largely blames influential proxy advisers, such as Institutional Shareholder Services, and investment funds for adopting a ""one-size-fits-all approach."" ISS and other advisers recommend voting against independent directors with more than four seats. BlackRock and Vanguard, two of the world's largest institutional investors, draw the line at three.

Longtime turnaround expert Steve Miller, who has served on several boards, said he tapped his connections and expertise in the bankruptcy and restructuring fields, acquired from his 17-year tenure as a United Airlines board member, when he joined the board of American International Group Inc. He joined AIG in 2009 as it began a major overhaul after the financial crisis, and stayed on at United until 2010. Now he is the chairman of Purdue Pharma.

Mr. Miller signed on at Purdue, the maker of OxyContin, in 2018 as it grappled with mounting litigation over accusations that it helped fuel the opioid epidemic. In an opinion piece published by The Wall Street Journal, he said he ""never encountered a situation as challenging or important to society than the one I now face.""

Directors on multiple boards are necessary fixtures in these boardrooms. ""They're parachuting in and can make a big difference,"" Mr. Miller said. ""They don't just accept everything at face value.""

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Millions of Jobs at Risk In Downturn

Corrections & Amplifications

The median ""optimistic"" forecast for third-quarter growth in nonfarm payrolls was 15,000 in a Wall Street Journal survey of 34 economists taken March 18-19. A graphic accompanying a March 23 Coronavirus Pandemic article about U.S. economic prospects incorrectly showed a loss of 15,000.

(WSJ April 8, 2020)

(END)

The fallout from the coronavirus outbreak is expected to have a significant negative impact on U.S. economic prospects, with predictions emerging for losses of up to five million jobs this year and a drop in economic output of as much as $1.5 trillion.

A recession is now all but certain, according to a Wall Street Journal survey of 34 economists that projects a downturn that would last months at least, and would in some ways rival -- and possibly even surpass -- the severity of the 2007-09 slump triggered by the housing collapse and subprime loan debacle.

""This shock is very big,"" said Bruce Kasman, head of economic research at JPMorgan. ""You are going to see in the next two months the consequences of the actions taken in terms of economic activity. That set of trade-offs is not really clear in policy makers' minds right now.""

Economic forecasts, which remained upbeat just two weeks ago, suddenly turned bleak as it became clear a pandemic, one that started in Asia and spread to Europe, would now affect American life far more than originally understood.

The extent of the expected downturn remains unclear to many economists, given uncertainty about the trajectory of the pandemic, extreme volatility in financial markets, restrictions on economic activity of unknown duration and a government response that is likely to continue to change in the weeks and months ahead.

Mr. Kasman expects U.S. gross domestic product will fall by 1.8% this year. Before the outbreak, he had projected output to grow 1.5%. That would translate into $700 billion in lost output.

The economy, Mr. Kasman believes, will lose between 7 million and 8 million jobs this spring, though some of those will likely come back if, as he expects, the economy rebounds in the second half of the year.

Sung Won Sohn, a business economist at Loyola Marymount University, expects the coronavirus to cost $592 billion in output, after inflation, and a loss of nearly 5.2 million jobs in 2020, compared with his pre-virus forecast.

Goldman Sachs projects U.S. output to fall 3.1% this year and unemployment to soar to 9% from the current 3.5%. Unemployment last peaked at 10% in October 2009, after the housing and financial collapse. Economists at Goldman estimate U.S. jobless claims -- a proxy for layoffs -- increased by roughly 2 million just this week.

""A public health emergency is morphing into an economic emergency,"" said David Shulman of the UCLA Anderson School of Management. ""The basic outlines of the economy will be determined more by biology than by economics.""

Some industries might actually be forced to hire workers as buying patterns shift. Amazon.com Inc., for example,plans to hire 100,000 more employees in the U.S. as it boosts online deliveries. Walmart Inc.said it would pay cash bonuses totaling $550 million to its hourly workers and hire 150,000 temporary staffers.

And some believe an unprecedented government relief effort could still avoid some of the worst-case scenarios. In the median ""optimistic"" forecast, economists still see an extremely sharp contraction in the second quarter, but a recovery apparent by the third quarter of 2020, with 1.7% growth that quarter and 3.1% growth in the fourth quarter.

Under this scenario, job growth could recover to 15,000 in the third quarter and 175,000 in the fourth quarter. Unemployment, they said, could still be contained at 4.5%.

For most economists, their optimistic scenario isn't a ""V-shaped recovery"" with a sharp collapse followed by an extremely rapid rebound, but a scenario in which the contraction is brief.

""Things look so gloomy right now that perhaps we should be grateful if we can get out of this health crisis with a brief recession,"" said Bernard Baumohl of the Economic Outlook Group.

""You just cannot rule out the prospect of a longer, more destructive depression,"" said Mr. Baumohl. ""What is clear is that we are in a race against time.""

The pessimistic scenario, according to the Journal survey, would be a sharp and long-lasting contraction. The median pessimistic forecast sees GDP decreasing by 10% in the second quarter, falling another 3.8% in the third quarter and dropping 0.5% in the fourth quarter. It projects the unemployment rate climbing continuously, reaching about 7.4% by the end of the year.

Job losses, under this scenario, could approach 800,000 a month in the second quarter, followed by 300,000 a month in the third quarter and 40,000 a month in the fourth quarter.

Risk, Uncertainty and Coronavirus

The government response to the coronavirus pandemic has seemed chaotic -- underreaction one minute, piling on restrictions the next. It has left many wondering whether anyone is weighing the trade-offs. Do heavy-handed measures carry the benefits to justify the considerable costs? The uncomfortable answer: We don't know.

The novel coronavirus appears at first to be a problem of risk management. It is a dangerous disease that threatens the lives of our neighbors and loved ones. Our response -- increased social distancing, shutting down businesses -- is aimed at reducing that risk. But the problem isn't risk so much as uncertainty.

In 1921, shortly after the 1918 flu pandemic, economist Frank Knight made the distinction between risk and uncertainty. The future is unknowable, but risk is measurable. It can be estimated using data, provided similar situations have happened before. Uncertainty, on the other hand, deals with outcomes we can't predict or never saw coming.

Risk can be managed. Uncertainty makes it impossible to weigh costs and benefits, such as whether reducing the spread of a virus is worth the cost of an economic shutdown that could last several months. The most responsible course of action is to assume the worst and take the most risk-averse position. Managing uncertainty is expensive: In markets, it means holding cash; in society, it means shutting down.

Almost everything about the novel coronavirus is uncertain. It was unexpected, though perhaps more of a surprise than it should have been. Public-health experts have been warning for years that a pandemic could happen. But every few years come warnings of potential catastrophes that never seem to materialize.

Among the unknowns about the virus: the true hospitalization and death rates; how infectious it is; how many asymptomatic patients are walking around; how it affects young people; how risk factors vary among different countries with different populations, pollution levels and urban densities. It seems certain the virus will overwhelm hospitals in some places, as it has in China and Italy. We also don't know how long these extreme economic and social disruptions will last. Without reliable information, predictions are based on incomplete data and heroic assumptions.

This uncertainty makes it much harder to manage the virus, or to strike a balance between public health and the economy. What happened in 1918 or 1957 isn't particularly instructive. The virus is different. The world is different. So is our health-care system.

The goal should be to move from uncertainty to risk, which will take time and data. The way forward is testing as many people as possible -- not only people with symptoms. Some carriers are asymptomatic. California is starting to test asymptomatic young people to learn more about transmission and infection rates. Testing everyone may not be feasible, but regularly testing a random sample of the population would be informative.

This helped in South Korea, which tested thousands of people a day. South Korea has managed to slow the rate of new cases and gather data about how the disease has spread, its effects on different populations, and the mortality rate in that country. More testing would also help spare the world from future shutdowns if the virus reappears before there is a safe, effective vaccine.

Every medical test has some rate of false positives and negatives. The error rate for Covid-19 tests may be especially high. Scientists are still learning about how long the virus lives in the body. Administering tests takes skill and is prone to human error. We don't know how reliable tests were in China; studies suggest the false-negative rate there is between 3% and 50% -- an enormous range. If tests aren't reliable, the supposed source of certainty can create even more uncertainty. The Food and Drug Administration must balance the urgency for more testing with caution to ensure new tests meet its standards for accuracy.

Policy makers should throw as much energy as possible into getting accurate data. That would allow the world to assess the real risk of the coronavirus. This may lead us to continue to take drastic action to limit its spread, or it may allow us to temper our response, managing the risk at a much lower cost to both society and the economy. Whatever the response, it will be appropriate, based on an assessment of risk -- not uncertainty and fear.

Life & Arts: Emily St. John Mandel Takes On a Madoff-Like Ponzi Scheme

With the coronavirus spreading fear and upending the financial world, Emily St. John Mandel seems especially prescient at choosing her novels' subjects. Sales have been surging for her 2014 book, ""Station Eleven,"" in which a lethal disease called the Georgia Flu quickly spreads across the world. Now ""The Glass Hotel,"" which Knopf will publish on Tuesday, depicts the fallout of financial collapse.

Although the new book was inspired by the Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme that was exposed in 2008, the story includes a range of characters adjacent to the fraud, with themes of class, complicity and what people do to gain and keep wealth. ""Once you start writing about a massive financial crime, you're writing about money broadly speaking,"" Ms. Mandel says.

The character Jonathan Alkaitis in ""The Glass Hotel"" bears no resemblance to Mr. Madoff, but his crime is a near duplicate. He creates a bogus investment fund that bilks charities, individuals and companies out of billions of dollars. As in the Madoff case, the scheme collapses in December 2008 when Alkaitis is arrested.

The novel swoops back and forth in time. It is written from multiple points of view, including Alkaitis, two of his victims, several employees complicit in his fraud, and a heroine named Vincent.

Vincent, who is adrift personally, has returned to the isolated Canadian island where she grew up, and works as a hotel bartender. She meets Alkaitis, the hotel's owner, and they settle into mutually beneficial arrangement in which she becomes his second wife, or so the world thinks.

Ms. Mandel, 41, grew up on Denman Island off the coast of British Columbia, and lives in Brooklyn. Here, an edited transcript.

WSJ: What intrigued you about the Madoff case?

A: One was the scale of the crime. Another was the way Madoff seemed almost like the embodiment of an era. What I remember from that time of the [2008] economic collapse is that there was incredible popular rage directed against him, but it wasn't just about the crime. We'd been operating under the assumption that our economy was fairly solid, but it turned out to have been a house of cards. And here was this fabulously wealthy con man who had stolen all of this money from so many people.

WSJ: Did you have any background in finance, or consult anyone in that world as research?

A: I have very little background in finance. Figuring out how the scheme worked was enough. I read books and the court transcripts, which were fascinating and sometimes wrenching. I didn't consult anyone in a formal way, but somebody quite close to me was a Madoff investor. He says now, ""We'd go over those financial statements. They never made sense. We could never figure out where those numbers were coming from, but the returns were so good, I shrugged."" There was a kind of collective delusion at play.

WSJ: One of Alkaitis's victims is Olivia, an artist in her 70s who loses all of her small savings.

A: There is an unfortunate phenomenon around the way artists think about money, which is that it's just not part of their calculation. That carefree Bohemian lifestyle doesn't always age well, and what can seem charming and romantic in your early 20s takes on a very different character by your mid-40s, let alone your 70s. Olivia hadn't educated herself about money, and trusted her friend Jonathan. She is a purely tragic character.

WSJ: The thoughts of the various employees complicit in the Ponzi scheme are written in a joint first-person voice called ""The Office Chorus."" Why link them?

A: I found myself fascinated by the collective guilt. Does the presence of all of these co-conspirators make it easier to commit the crime? They begin, ""We had crossed a line."" I think it's easier to say we crossed a line, than I crossed a line. I found myself thinking about the camaraderie one has with any group of co-workers and how much more intense that would be if you were engaged in a crime.

WSJ: Vincent learns that having money gives her ""the freedom to stop thinking about money."" What has your own relationship to money been?

A: I'm from a working-class background. There was always a low-level anxiety about money. Following the success of ""Station Eleven,"" I'm fairly financially comfortable. My experience is that it's just revelatory to not have to constantly think about money.

WSJ: Since the coronavirus hit, have you been hearing from readers about ""Station Eleven""?

A: Only via Twitter, and responses are divided. Some people seem sort of mad that they chose to read a pandemic novel during a pandemic. Other people seem comforted by it. I would personally not choose to read a pandemic novel during a pandemic. Maybe wait a few months.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Trump Sparks Run on Two Drugs

Health officials across the world are issuing warnings over the use of antimalarial drugs after President Trump's comments about treating the coronavirus with them sparked panic-buying and overdoses.

In recent days, thousands of consumers across Africa and South Asia rushed to stockpile chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, drugs that are usually used to combat malaria, vacuuming up supplies in cities in the developing world, sending prices skyrocketing and prompting panicked warnings from local authorities.

In the U.S. and some other developed countries, meantime, some doctors have started to prescribe the drugs against the coronavirus, sparking heated ethical debates because their efficacy has yet to be demonstrated in full-scale clinical studies.

At issue, health officials said, is how to reconcile the pace of rigorous scientific research with the exponential spread of the infection.

""There is no known dosage for Covid-19 and whether it can actually cure it, it's safer to avoid chloroquine,"" said Dr. Chris Kaganda, a Ugandan public-health expert, referring to the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus. ""But you know these are desperate times.""

Nigeria's government on Saturday said three people had been hospitalized after overdosing on chloroquine, while pharmacies in Lagos, the continent's largest city at 20 million people, reported running out of supplies.

Similar panic-buying scenes took place in Uganda, Ghana, Kenya and Morocco. Chloroquine has also sold out in pharmacies across Pakistan, those looking for the drug said.

Chloroquine-based drugs are common in Africa, which accounts for 92% of malaria cases in the world. The drugs can be bought over the counter without prescription and are also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.

President Trump said at a White House briefing last week that he told the Food and Drug Administration to expedite the study and use of the ""very powerful"" drug chloroquine to treat coronavirus. The president doubled down on Saturday, posting on his Twitter feed that hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin ""taken together"" could be ""one of the biggest game-changers in the history of medicine"" and urged them to be deployed ""IMMEDIATELY.""

Mr. Trump's claims immediately began trending on social media across Africa. In Nigeria, which has reported 22 cases of the virus, the stockpiling and hospitalizations forced health officials to warn citizens against self-medicating with the drug. The country's Centre for Disease Control said the World Health Organization hasn't approved use of the drug against the virus.

Antimalarial drugs chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine have both shown early signs of improving symptoms of some patients diagnosed with Covid-19, based on reports by doctors and researchers in South Korea, France and China.

In France, interest in antimalarial drugs surged last week after a French professor released a study showing that 100% of patients infected by coronavirus and treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and the azithromycin antibiotic were cured after six days. The proportion of cured patients was 70% for those treated only with hydroxychloroquine and 12.5% for those who received no treatment, the study showed.

Although the study had a very limited scope -- it encompassed only 30 patients -- French Prof. Didier Raoult said he opted to publish the findings because of the urgent need for an effective drug against coronavirus.

Inserm, a research institute affiliated with the French health ministry, on Sunday said it had added hydroxychloroquine to a list of experimental treatments it will test as part of a broader European study.

But while experts have warned that there is no scientific evidence yet that the drug is effective against the virus, some doctors say they can't wait for theresults of clinical studies.

In the U.S., hospital orders for chloroquine were up 3,000% from March 1 to 17 compared with typical demand, according to Premier Inc., one of the largest group-purchasing organizations in the U.S. for drugs and other hospital supplies. During that same period, hydroxychloroquine orders were up 260% compared with typical demand.

Chloroquine, approved for Americans in the 1940s, and hydroxychloroquine, greenlighted the next decade, are also prescribed for patients with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.

U.S. News: Nashville Faces a One-Two Punch --- Businesses that just reopened after this month's tornado are forced to close again

When a tornado tore across Nashville earlier this month, destroying homes and businesses, it blew out windows at one of Margot McCormack's restaurants and damaged the roof of another. She managed to reopen the eateries in the trendy East Nashville neighborhood in less than a week despite power outages and no phone or internet service.

Then the new coronavirus struck. She had to close the restaurant dining rooms again and focus on takeout service. Sales have plummeted. She had to lay off most of her roughly 50 employees.

""We have no idea what's going to happen,"" said Ms. McCormack, 56 years old. ""We're all frightened out of our minds.""

Parts of Tennessee have taken a crushing one-two punch. Five tornadoes thrashed a swath of middle Tennessee on March 3, leaving 25 people dead and thousands of buildings damaged or destroyed. With recovery efforts still under way in many affected areas, residents and business owners are now confronting a viral menace.

""It's obviously devastating,"" said Courtney McKay, the 28-year-old owner of caterer In Good Company in Nashville. ""I don't know how we're supposed to rebuild.""

More than 1,500 residential structures and nearly 500 commercial ones were affected by the tornado that struck Nashville. Though roads have been reopened and electricity has been restored, debris collection is continuing, and people are still filing claims with the federal government.

Since the first Covid-19 case was confirmed in Davidson County, home to Nashville, five days after the tornado, the coronavirus has taken an increasing toll. The county had 179 cases as of Sunday, according to the Nashville mayor's office. The city has prohibited dine-in service at restaurants, shut down nonessential businesses and directed residents to stay at home except for necessary tasks.

Disaster-assistance centers, which were opened after the tornado for people to submit claims and apply for assistance, were closed over the weekend.

Before that, ""we were still seeing pretty fluid traffic coming in,"" said Hannah Davis, the city's affordable housing program manager. The city is exploring new ways of reaching those affected, she said.

Though thousands of volunteers helped clear debris and distribute food in the aftermath of the tornado in Nashville, fewer have been showing up as coronavirus worries take hold, said Lori Shinton, chief executive of volunteer organization Hands On Nashville. Following the guidance of health officials, the organization is now deploying volunteers in groups not exceeding 10 people.

In Putnam County, a hard-hit area about 80 miles east of Nashville where one of the twisters killed 19 people, debris removal is still under way, said Mayor Randy Porter. About 700 homes were damaged by the tornadoes, and engineers continue to go house to house to examine structural and electrical issues.

Twenty-nine businesses, from manufacturers to diners, were hurt, said Allison Boshears, director of communications for the Cookeville-Putnam County Chamber of Commerce. Some companies that succeeded in reopening have now shut down and sent employees home because of concerns over the virus's spread, she said. As of Saturday, the county had five Covid-19 cases, Mr. Porter said.

Phil Cobucci's living room was demolished when the tornado sent part of an adjacent building crashing through the roof of his house in northern Nashville. The pergola outside vanished, and his car was totaled. He and his partner have been staying with friends and are about to move to a rental while they go through the insurance-claims process.

Now that the economy is grinding to a halt, work for Mr. Cobucci's marketing firm, BAM! Social Business, is quickly drying up. He estimates he could lose as much as 70% of his business.

""When the tornado hit, it was hour by hour, touch and go,"" said the 36-year-old. ""Now it's minute by minute.""

In East Nashville, Tanya Coe reopened her boutique Goodbuy Girls, which sustained some structural damage, 11 days after the tornado. The following day, she closed it, as social distancing and other measures taken in response to the coronavirus depleted foot traffic. She is now focused on selling online, but worries that demand for the vintage cowgirl boots her store is known for will evaporate.

""It has hurt a lot financially,"" said Ms. Coe, 33. And ""things could get a lot worse.""

China Is a Bad Coronavirus Role Model

The coronavirus pandemic has elicited some strange jealousy for China's authoritarianism. ""In the face of a previously unknown virus, China has rolled out perhaps the most ambitious, agile and aggressive disease containment effort in history,"" declared a Feb. 28 World Health Organization report. The argument is that the unchecked power of the Chinese government is a main reason the country has successfully slowed -- and perhaps even stopped -- domestic transmission of the virus. Some commentators even claim that China will emerge from the crisis a stronger global power, and that the U.S. will need its help to recover.

These claims are misleading. More to the point, neither China nor its style of authoritarian government will help America overcome the crisis, restore economic growth, and protect citizens from infectious diseases.

The first case of the new coronavirus in China can be traced to Nov. 17, according to government data seen by the South China Morning Post. New cases were reported by health authorities each day thereafter in November. Rather than share this information with the world, Chinese Communist Party officials suppressed discoveries and even punished the doctors who first reported them.

Li Wenliang warned fellow doctors in late December of a new disease that resembled SARS. He was reprimanded by Chinese police, accused of ""making false comments"" that had ""severely disturbed the social order,"" and made to admit to ""illegal behavior."" Li then contracted the coronavirus and died on Feb. 7 at 33.

China's coverup had global consequences. It wasted precious time during which governments could have isolated people at risk of spreading the disease from its epicenter in Wuhan, developed testing and treatment capacities, and prepared citizens to take precautions to protect themselves. China compromised the world's ability to respond to the deadly virus. The result has been the most dangerous global pandemic in a century.

This crisis has also laid bare gaps in American policy. The U.S. needs to reevaluate its reliance on basic medical necessities made overseas. Biodefense is a key component of national security; the U.S. needs to put more technology -- including real-time mapping and artificial intelligence -- to work tracking diseases before the next big outbreak. U.S. officials also need to continue to speak the truth about who is going to help the world overcome this crisis. Spoiler: it isn't the Chinese Communist Party.

As scientists around the world -- including from China -- are working at breakneck speed to develop a vaccine for the coronavirus, the Chinese Communist Party continues to sow the seeds of division and misinformation world-wide. China's Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, whose Twitter account is an absurd repository of propaganda, accused the U.S. military earlier this month of bringing the coronavirus to Wuhan.

Last week China announced it was banishing most reporters from the Journal, the New York Times and the Washington Post, many of whom conducted heroic front-line reporting on the coronavirus. These are not the actions of a global leader.

It will likely be the free nations of the world, with their superior capacities for scientific innovation, that develop treatments, a vaccine and new means of stopping the epidemic. And we can trust that they will share those innovations quickly with the world. It will also be the free economies, with their capacities for renewal and growth, that will bring back prosperity after the crisis abates. We can expect the free nations, led by the U.S., to emerge much stronger than China.

My Hudson Institute colleague John Lee has chronicled in two recent reports how the Chinese economy was slowing even before this global downturn because of chronic, politically directed overinvestment. This still threatens the solvency of China's overleveraged local governments. Remember, too, why China steals intellectual property: because it can't produce innovation on the scale that the U.S. economy does.

Free, transparent and dynamic economic and political systems are needed to win the fight against the coronavirus and drive the recovery. This is why the U.S. will remain the most important global leader. Don't expect Communist China to offer meaningful help any time soon.

Crime in New York City is falling as the city's response to the new coronavirus ramps up, data released by the New York Police Department on Monday show.

The number of serious felonies reported by the NYPD dropped by 16.6% between March 16 and March 22, compared with the same period last year, according to police data.

Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered city schools closed on March 15, in the first in a series of wide-reaching official actions to stem the spread of the disease.

There were 1,337 serious felonies in the city for the week that ended Sunday, compared with 1,604 in the same week one year earlier, according to the NYPD data.

The only significant increase in the city's seven-index crimes -- murder, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny and grand larceny auto -- was in stolen vehicles.

Car thefts rose 51.5% for the week ended Sunday, according to the NYPD's figures, rising from 68 incidents for that week in 2019, to 103 incidents in 2020.

During a Friday news conference about coronavirus, NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said the public-health crisis is deterring crime.

""You see crowds disappearing on streets and other areas,"" Mr. Shea said. ""That has translated to a decrease in crime.""

The commissioner also said the NYPD has seen a decrease in 911 emergency calls throughout the city, with the exception of calls for service regarding sick people, which have increased.

According to the NYPD's data, the crime of murder saw the biggest percentage decrease for the week of March 16 through March 22, falling 85.7% from seven murders for that week in 2019 to one murder for the same period in 2020.

The NYPD data show officers made 16% fewer arrests since the mayor closed the schools in response to the virus, with 701 arrests for the week of March 16 through March 22, compared with 835 arrests for the same period in 2019.

Police officers also issued fewer parking tickets and summonses for traffic violations, the figures show.

Global View
Will Coronavirus Kill Populism?

The coronavirus's economic impact is dramatic; the virus's consequences for world politics could be more consequential. To begin with, the balance of world power could change significantly as some nations recover with relative speed, while others face longer and deeper social and political crises. But the crisis is also affecting nations' domestic politics, and it is through this channel that its most lasting consequences will likely be felt.

Well before the pandemic, populist movements, sometimes under authoritarian leaders, were challenging established, centrist political parties and ideas around the world. The globalist, free-trade policies that had dominated the international agenda since the 1990s were among the populists' chief targets, along with international institutions ranging from the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization to the European Union.

The question is whether the pandemic will provoke renewed support for technical expertise and multilateralism or will accelerate the erosion of what critics call the ""neoliberal order"" of the post-Cold War world.

There is a clear case for a return to establishment politics and global policy making in the face of a problem like the coronavirus. Both the medical and economic dimensions of the pandemic call for expert leadership and international cooperation. Neither the spread of a global disease nor its economic consequences can be dealt with by national governments on their own. If one country succeeds in controlling the epidemic but its neighbors fail, the epidemic will return. And the disruption of world trade patterns and financial markets will require concerted action to get the global economy back on its feet.

So far, however, the coronavirus does not seem to be promoting cooperation among world leaders or respect for global institutions. The pandemic has widened the gap between the U.S. and China. While the EU has moved quickly to remove limits on eurozone members' fiscal deficits, Europe's national governments so far have focused almost entirely on addressing their problems without much consultation. Steps like excluding Taiwan from emergency meetings and praising China's response to the virus have made the World Health Organization look like a mouthpiece for Beijing. Neither the Group of Seven nor the Group of 20 has played a conspicuous role, and the IMF and World Bank haven't been at the forefront of the world's response. National governments, not international agencies and institutions, have primarily shaped the response.

This may all change as this unprecedented global crisis unfolds, but the current dynamic will likely continue for some time. With the partial exception of the eurozone, the sudden need for many businesses to seek loans and bailouts from national governments will increase the power of national politicians. It will also encourage voters -- many of whose livelihoods will now depend on government help -- to look to national leaders as their defenders against storms and dangers arising from foreign parts.

Yet some aspects of the crisis push the political trend the other way. Namely, many countries lack the resources needed to weather a shock of this kind. As the pandemic cripples economic activity in countries like Egypt and Pakistan, international organizations like the IMF and the World Bank will likely move back toward center stage.

The international trading system will face unprecedented pressure. The WTO was not designed for times like this; a period of nation-state-led economic recovery will put more pressure on that troubled organization. The potential for enduring shifts in the politics of trade should not be discounted. The Chinese origin of the virus and the ensuing recession and disruption of supply chains could lead voters in many countries to embrace the politics of protectionism and autarky. If national leaders conclude that the security of critical medical, information-technology and defense supply chains justifies the economic cost of the protectionist policies required to produce critical industrial and medical goods at home, the cause of free trade would suffer a major defeat.

The world will be looking at the U.S. elections this year with more than its usual concern. The verdict of American voters on Donald Trump, the world's most prominent antiestablishment populist, will have both substantive and symbolic consequences for politics around the world. A victory for Joe Biden would put the weight of the U.S. government back on the side of the post-Cold War program of multilateralism and globalization.

At the level of symbolism, a Trump defeat would signal to politicians around the world that the populist surge might have peaked; we could see a return to more consensus-based centrist politics and policy making in other parts of the West.

A Trump win, on the other hand, would be the strongest possible signal to the world that the politics of disruption have not run their course. Mr. Trump's election was a shock to the old international system; his re-election in the aftermath of the pandemic would be more consequential still.

World News: U.S. Launches Bid to Save Afghanistan Deal

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo launched a diplomatic mission on Monday to salvage the Trump administration's faltering, three-week-old deal with the Taliban that sets a timetable for the U.S. to withdraw from Afghanistan by the middle of next year.

Amid a coronavirus pandemic that has constricted global travel, Mr. Pompeo flew to Afghanistan and Qatar for unannounced meetings with Afghan leaders and the Taliban.

He sought to inject new momentum into a deal with the Taliban that has quickly run into new obstacles, threatening the administration's efforts to extricate America from 18 years of war in Afghanistan.

At a joint U.S.-Qatar military base in Doha, Mr. Pompeo met with Mullah Baradar, the Taliban's chief negotiator, in a bid to persuade the group to accept a compromise prison swap plan that is supposed to happen before the next phase of peace talks begins.

The Taliban are refusing to meet with the Afghan government for substantive talks until Kabul frees 5,000 of its prisoners -- a deal the U.S. agreed to help broker when it signed the deal with the militant group.

In Kabul, Mr. Pompeo spent eight hours in talks that produced no breakthrough toward bridging a political divide that has led to the creation of parallel Afghan presidencies, according to U.S. and Afghan officials.

""We are in a crisis,"" said a senior State Department official in Kabul. ""The fear is that unless this crisis gets resolved and resolved soon, that could affect the peace process . . . and our agreement with the Talibs could be put at risk.""

The Trump administration agreed last month to pull all its forces out of Afghanistan by July 2021 -- if the Taliban do what they can to make sure the country isn't used as a haven for terrorists planning attacks on the U.S.

After the deal was signed, President Trump spoke by phone with Mullah Baradar and expressed optimism that the Taliban leader would honor the pact.

U.S. officials have warned the Taliban that they are squandering an opportunity for peace by carrying out a series of deadly attacks across Afghanistan since they signed the deal in Doha. Mr. Pompeo has warned the group that it must curtail its attacks for the deal to be a success.

Afghanistan is also riven by internal political divisions. President Ashraf Ghani was sworn in this month for a second five-year term. But his election challenger, former ally Abdullah Abdullah, refused to accept the results amid allegations of fraud. Instead, Mr. Abdullah, the country's former chief executive officer, has declared himself president and sought to create a parallel government in Kabul.

Mr. Pompeo got both men to agree to meet with him on Monday at Mr. Ghani's presidential palace. But the meetings produced no breakthrough, according to U.S. and Afghan officials. Mr. Ghani rejected demands by Mr. Abdullah that he be named executive prime minister and have equal power, according to sources within the Afghan government.

""The mediation by Secretary Pompeo had no result, and he left Kabul,"" a senior Afghan government official said.

Mr. Pompeo had planned to meet again with both men after they held private talks. Instead, he left Kabul without seeing the Afghan leaders again.

""What we want is President Ghani and former chief executive Abdullah to come to an agreement about how to form an inclusive government that is acceptable to both,"" the U.S. official said.

Former Secretary of State John Kerry carried out a similar diplomatic mission in 2014, when Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah first ran against each other for president. At that time, the two men agreed to a power-sharing deal that made Mr. Ghani president and Mr. Abdullah the country's chief executive officer.

Mr. Abdullah challenged Mr. Ghani again last year in an election marred by allegations of fraud. The Afghan government certified Mr. Ghani as president, but Mr. Abdullah rejected the results.

This month, the two Afghan leaders held simultaneous inauguration ceremonies in adjacent palaces in Kabul. While Mr. Abdullah wields almost no power, his parallel presidency has undercut progress in talks with the Taliban.

The Taliban were supposed to sit down with Afghan leaders two weeks ago to launch direct talks. But they have to resolve the prisoner swap first.

On Sunday, the U.S. and Qatar helped broker an unusual Skype meeting between Taliban leaders and Afghan government officials to discuss the impasse. Mr. Pompeo sought Monday to advance a compromise that would allow peace talks to proceed.

The U.S.-Taliban deal raised hopes for a significant reduction in violence in Afghanistan. That hasn't happened. The Taliban vowed to avoid attacks on U.S. troops in Afghanistan, but said they would keep fighting Afghan security forces.

At least 100 security forces and civilians have been killed since the deal was signed about three weeks ago. The deadliest attack took place last week in the southern province of Zabul, where at least 25 security forces were killed in an attack on their checkpoints, local officials said.

Tax Would Hit Brooklyn Middle Class Hardest

A mayoral commission's preliminary proposal to overhaul New York City's complex property-tax system would dramatically raise the tax burden on owners of one-to-three-family homes, while holding down taxes on co-op and condominium apartments, a Wall Street Journal analysis found.

Taxes on houses would rise by a total of more than $1.13 billion, or about 25% above current taxes, even though more than a third of all owners of these homes would pay less.

Owners of Manhattan penthouses and mansions would pay more too, but the plan would have the biggest tax shock on homeowners across an arc of newly fashionable Brooklyn neighborhoods, from Williamsburg in the north to Park Slope, where Mayor Bill de Blasio owns two row houses, to Bushwick to the east.

The commission was set up in 2018 to recommend changes to the city's tax system after a lawsuit backed by renters, civil-rights groups and major building owners threatened to upend it.

The suit charged that the complex system was unconstitutional and rigged to favor owners of houses and co-op and condominium apartments at the expense of other taxpayers and the renters who indirectly pay the tax.

The initial recommendations, released in January, proposed sweeping away special rules that kept assessments and taxes low by limiting assessments, and providing significant abatements to co-op and condo owners who live in their units. Instead, they proposed taxing all owners of houses, co-ops and condos based on the full-market value of properties, using a single combined tax rate that would raise the same amount of total tax revenue.

The plans call for the changes to be phased in over five years, and would include exemptions to protect taxpayers on limited incomes.

James Parrott, a commission member and director of economic and fiscal policies at the Center for New York City Affairs, cautioned that the commission's work is still at an early stage and could change. The commission has begun holding hearings on its proposals.

The commission focused on examples of inequities by comparing tax burden to market values, which have risen sharply in many neighborhoods as the city's economy boomed. The Journal looked at the impact and calculated estimated tax bills for 955,000 residential properties across the city, based on the commission plan.

In Brooklyn, owners of houses, co-ops and condominiums built before 2010 would face higher taxes, especially in neighborhoods where taxes haven't kept pace with the rise in values. Brooklyn taxpayers in total would pay $953 million more, a 42% increase.

More than four out of five homeowners in Brooklyn would see increases, while nearly three out of four taxpayers in Staten Island would pay less.

Overall throughout the city, taxes on co-ops and condos would be little changed. Taxes on co-ops would fall 2% on average, while taxes on older condos would be unchanged on average. But condos built since 2010 would see taxes rise by nearly 20%.

In the past, homeowners who benefited from the city's property-tax system have been able to persuade politicians to protect them year after year. But tax reformers now hope that the plan will divide homeowners as it cuts taxes for some and raises them for others, giving it a chance of passage in Albany.

Taxes on City Councilman Brad Lander's brick row house in Park Slope would rise nearly fivefold, according to the Journal analysis.

""I have been dramatically undertaxed and that is not, in aggregate, fair to the city,"" he said. He attributed the discrepancy to changes in ""neighborhoods that have seen gentrification over the last decade or so.""

But the Democrat said he wouldn't support a system that is ""fair on average"" unless it protects homeowners on limited incomes.

Taxes on two homes owned by Mr. de Blasio a few blocks away would rise from about $9,000 a year to more than $25,000, the Journal found. The mayor's office had no comment.

The Journal analysis estimated market values of co-ops, condos and small apartment buildings by reviewing 400,000 past sales and identified $543 billion in additional market values for these properties by looking at sales of nearby properties with similar characteristics.

It then computed the tax rate that would be needed in the new tax system to produce the current revenue paid to the city. The rate was used to calculate individual tax bills under the plan.

At 220 Central Park South, a Manhattan penthouse that sold last year for a New York record of $240 million, would face a tax of $2.26 million, up from $557,881. At 834 Fifth Ave., a co-op where an apartment sold for $77.5 million in 2015, taxes were projected to rise to $323,000 for each unit on average from $116,000.

But across much of Manhattan, co-op average taxes would fall sharply, and overall, two-thirds of co-ops would get lower bills.

To offset the impact of higher taxes, the commission proposed a discount for taxpayers who live in their homes and have limited incomes. The money to be paid for these subsidies and discounts would be raised through a higher tax rate for all residential taxpayers.

A subsidy of $600 million would raise overall taxes by an additional 4.8%, the Journal analysis found. That would translate to nearly 71,000 fewer taxpayers getting a tax cut than projected by the analysis before any discounts or subsidies are applied.

Since the commission made its recommendations, pressure from the constitutional challenge to the tax system has eased: In February, an appellate court panel, in a unanimous ruling, dismissed the suit.

Voters Could Voice

Ire on Election Day

Many Brooklyn homes are owned and occupied by less affluent families, who could find it hard to pay higher taxes.

Robert Marvin, a retired city worker and his wife, Elaine, a retired teacher, face a potential tax increase of $9,700, according to the Journal analysis, more than double their current tax bill on the row house in Prospect Lefferts Gardens they purchased in 1974 for $28,000.

With a fixed income from pensions and Social Security of about $120,000 a year, he said they likely wouldn't qualify for possible tax relief. He noted there could be backlash: ""Homeowners vote in disproportionate percentages and have a considerable amount of political clout.""

Coronavirus Threatens America's Nonprofits

As policy makers respond to the coronavirus pandemic and its economic effects, they shouldn't forget about America's nonprofits, which are on the front lines of caring for the nation's most vulnerable populations. My organization is a case in point. Easterseals' national network of 68 affiliates provides services to people with disabilities. The closing of early-childhood programs, schools, after-school programs, adult day centers and other facilities threatens both their ability to provide services and the revenue streams that come from those services.

According to a report from the National Council of Nonprofits, 80% of U.S. nonprofit revenue comes from fees for services and government grants or contracts, 14% from private contributions, and 6% from other sources, including investment income. All these sources of money are in danger from the closing of facilities, cancellation of fundraising events, and decline in the stock market.

Nonprofits employ more than 12 million Americans and spend nearly $2 trillion a year. And the pandemic is creating new challenges for those who provide services. Nursing homes and other elder-care facilities are closing to visitors. Physical therapists and other health professionals who provide services to the elderly aren't able to do their jobs. As schools move to online classes, teachers and occupational therapists are unable to help children master skills needed to develop and thrive.

That's why it's vital that corporate and government leaders support strong partnerships to assure the continued strength and well-being of those who serve our communities.

Here are three priorities for policy makers:

-- Increase flexibility and expand eligibility for small-business loans. The pandemic has created a significant burden for small businesses -- including nonprofit ones -- that struggle to pay rent or mortgages while meeting payroll.

-- Mandate reimbursement for medical services within 45 days. Access to services is critical for millions of Americans who are older or have disabilities. Those services are accessible only if providers are reimbursed in a timely manner. The workforce that serves this population already experiences high rates of turnover as a result of low wages. Now, in states where the demand for care is growing daily, it's at risk of collapsing.

-- Expand access to services and support that keep vulnerable populations at home. All Americans are being urged to stay home as much as possible to prevent further spread of infection. Abiding by these recommendations is impossible for many people who depend on various health-care services. The federal and state governments can do more to support services delivered in the home, thereby minimizing the likelihood of institutionalization.

The nonprofit landscape is part of what makes America the greatest nation on Earth. Now's the time to take action to ensure the viability of the nonprofits our communities need.

U.S. News: Limit on Insanity Defense Allowed

WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court said state or federal lawmakers can significantly limit the insanity defense, rejecting claims that the Constitution requires acquittal of defendants who lack the capacity to distinguish right from wrong when committing their crimes.

""Defining the precise relationship between criminal culpability and mental illness involves examining the workings of the brain, the purposes of the criminal law, the ideas of free will and responsibility,"" Justice Elena Kagan wrote for the 6-3 court, splitting from her liberal colleagues. ""Which is all to say that it is a project for state governance, not constitutional law.""

The case came from Kansas, which in 1996 limited the insanity defense to defendants who lack, ""as a result of mental disease or defect . . . the culpable mental state required as an element of the offense charged,"" such as not understanding what a gun was for or the harm it could cause.

The legislature eliminated the traditional understanding of the defense in American and English law, under which defendants may also be acquitted if they lack the ability to recognize their criminal acts are morally wrong.

The British House of Lords explained the principle in an 1843 decision known as M'Naghten's Case, in which a Scottish wood-turner was acquitted of killing a government secretary he mistook for the prime minister after being found to suffer paranoid delusions of persecution by the Tory party.

James Kahler, under death sentence for the 2009 murders of four family members, argued that his due process rights were violated when Kansas denied him the opportunity to argue he was criminally insane because of severe depression that may have made him, as a defense expert testified, ""psychotic and impaired to the point"" of losing the required degree of moral consciousness.

Justice Kagan was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.

Justice Stephen Breyer, joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor, dissented.

U.S. News: PG&E To Plead Guilty in 2018 Fire

PG&E Corp. said it would accept criminal responsibility for starting the deadliest wildfire in California's history, becoming one of a small number of U.S. corporations to plead guilty to felony charges of involuntary manslaughter.

The indictment by a grand jury and PG&E's decision to plead guilty put to rest significant questions about the extent of the company's culpability in starting the Camp Fire in 2018.

PG&E, a utility that supplies electricity and natural gas to 16 million people, or about one in 20 Americans, admitted that its failure to maintain its equipment was criminally negligent and caused the deaths of more than 80 people. However, the indictment doesn't charge any PG&E employees or executives.

Butte County District Attorney Mike Ramsey, who led the investigation, said evidence showed that the company's maintenance problems resulted from decisions made by many people over many years, and he decided not to charge any single person.

On Monday morning, the San Francisco utility disclosed that it would plead guilty to an indictment in Butte County, where 85 people died during the Camp Fire. The indictment charges the company with 84 counts of manslaughter and one count of unlawfully causing a fire.

The company has agreed to pay a $3.48 million penalty, the statutory maximum.

Prosecutors proposed charging PG&E with arson, rather than manslaughter, if it agreed to pay $200 million in criminal and civil penalties negotiated as part of a plea bargain, according to people familiar with the matter. To avoid the higher penalty, which could derail equity financing commitments supporting its restructuring plan, PG&E opted to plead to the manslaughter charges.

Investors sent shares in the company up 12.47% on Monday, even as the Dow Jones Utility Average dropped 5.45%, according to FactSet.

PG&E filed for chapter 11 protection in January of last year, citing billions of dollars in liability costs it faces because of its role in sparking wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that collectively killed more than 100 people and destroyed about 15,700 homes.

PG&E is set to be arraigned on the charges April 24 in Butte County Superior Court.

The grand jury's indictment caps a yearlong criminal investigation led by Mr. Ramsey, with assistance from the office of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra. It examined the role PG&E's power lines played in sparking the Camp Fire, which destroyed the town of Paradise.

""PG&E acted with criminal negligence, which is a much higher standard than ordinary negligence,"" Mr. Ramsey said. ""They acted in a way that created a high risk of death.""

PG&E said that it hoped that by accepting a plea, both the company and community could focus on rebuilding.

""We cannot replace all that the fire destroyed, but our hope is that this plea agreement, along with our rebuilding efforts, will help the community move forward from this tragic incident,"" the company said.

The company declined to comment on negotiations before the plea agreement.

California fire investigators previously determined the fire started after a worn piece of metal known as a ""C-hook"" broke free from a transmission tower, releasing a high-voltage power line that sparked and ignited the brush below.

Life & Arts: Hip-Hop in the Jazz Club

Kassa Overall calls himself ""a backpack jazz producer -- something like a cross between a jazz musician, a backpack rapper and a bedroom producer,"" he told me in an interview. Thus, ""I Think I'm Good"" (Brownswood) was created in both solitude and on the run, at spots throughout his adopted hometown, New York, and on the road.

Some of the material was improvised on bandstands at jazz clubs, some in recording studios and the homes of his colleagues. All of it was chopped up and recombined using the skeletal music studio Mr. Overall carries in his backpack, whenever and wherever inspiration struck, including, yes, his bedroom. He rode his bicycle to the apartment of Morgan Guerin, a brilliant multi-instrumentalist whose voice, via electric bass, drums and various woodwind instruments, is one of the album's defining elements. The Steinway at pianist Sullivan Fortner's home provided a basis for two tracks -- the ominous ""Please Don't Kill Me"" and the pent-up ""Halfway House.""

The album Mr. Overall ended up with sounds intimate and personal, its sung and rapped lyrics embedded with dark confessions and hopeful pleas. It is also a community project, involving 23 fellow musicians; like Mr. Overall, who is 37 years old, all of them are on the ascending side of careers defined more by musical curiosity and personal affiliations than by genre and style. (The pianists alone include Vijay Iyer, Craig Taborn, Aaron Parks, Courtney Bryan and Mr. Fortner.)

Mr. Overall's combination of live performances, studio recordings and remixes and his bridging of jazz and hip-hop cultures are nothing new. Musicians such as Kendrick Lamar and Flying Lotus have made these approaches something of a lingua franca just now. But Mr. Overall possesses a rare balance of skills and experience on both sides of the equation. He lives in both worlds. Early on, he was a drummer displaying savvy technique and uncommon sensitivity in pianist Geri Allen's band. He was also a rapper/producer, combining force and tenderness in collaboration with the hip-hop collective Das Racist. He flashed irrepressible charm alongside pianist Jon Batiste's band on ""The Late Show With Stephen Colbert"" and rapped stark lyrics about societal ills as a member of drummer Terri Lyne Carrington's Social Science band. His previous release, ""Go Get Ice Cream and Listen to Jazz,"" furthered a jazz/hip-hop/neo-soul blend that trumpeter Roy Hargrove pioneered (and featured Hargrove, as recorded six months before his untimely death).

As an undergraduate at Oberlin College, Mr. Overall once confronted faculty that endorsed his jazz studies but disapproved of his passion for hip-hop ""beat-making."" He has long since reconciled that schism through his music. While in college, he also experienced manic episodes that required brief hospitalization; he ended up overmedicated. He now seeks to integrate his private struggles into the narratives of his songs.

On his previous album, Mr. Overall rapped: ""What's the best stocks? Prison and pharmaceuticals."" Here, his allusions to pain and paranoia -- ""I hope they let me go tonight,"" during ""Visible Walls,"" and ""When I lay down to rest and it feel like a plot,"" in ""I Know You See Me"" -- blur the personal with the political. They can be heard as statements about incarceration or metaphors for imprisonment of the mind. The line, ""I can't breathe when I get down,"" in ""Please Don't Kill Me,"" might be shouted at a Black Lives Matter protest march or whispered over the phone by a depressive.

Like his lyrics, Mr. Overall's music is richly textured yet utterly accessible. Both lyrics and music are packed with references lent new meaning. The catchy melody of ""Darkness In Mind"" is Chopin's (from Prelude No. 4, as played by Mr. Fortner). The harmonies of ""Please Don't Kill Me"" are lifted from Coltrane's ""Naima."" Mr. Overall quotes liberally from lyrics by folk singer Phil Ochs and rapper Andre Benjamin. Yet his original commentary, sung and rapped, is riveting. His songs are memorable, sometimes constructed from seeming fragments. For ""Find Me,"" he seized upon an improvisation by pianist Aaron Parks, as recorded during Mr. Overall's extended residency at Manhattan's Jazz Gallery. He ""chopped and cropped"" that passage, along with looped tracks of his own drumming. At a later performance, he triggered recorded samples of that material to stimulate new ideas. Then, back into the backpack studio, resulting in what he calls ""a song upon a song upon a song.""

One final track, ""Was She Happy (For Geri Allen),"" performed in duet with Mr. Iyer, is in tribute to his former employer, who died in 2017, and who was a brilliant yet enigmatic presence. ""She was on a quest, she was on a journey,"" the lyrics declare. Mr. Overall's new album questions his own state of mind and whatever we might mean by ""happy."" It also begins to chart his journey, headed somewhere rewarding and new.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: India Steps Up Lockdown to Slow Spread

NEW DELHI -- Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered all nonessential government offices and private businesses to shut and all Indians to remain at home for three weeks as the world's largest democracy ramps up efforts to slow the spread of the new coronavirus.

India, a country of 1.3 billion, has 519 confirmed cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and 10 deaths as of Tuesday, according to data from the federal Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

In a televised address to the nation, Mr. Modi also announced the government would allocate 150 billion rupees ($2 billion) to set up health-care infrastructure such as isolation wards and to buy ventilators, testing kits and other necessary equipment.

""I appeal with folded hands, don't come out of your homes during the lockdown,"" Mr. Modi said in the address.

The lockdown will extend at least until April 14.

India has recently seen a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases and the government has scrambled to stay ahead of the spread.

On Sunday, the government ordered a one-day lockdown of the country and said all long-distance train service would be suspended across the country. All domestic and most international flights will also be suspended.

Schools in some cities had begun closing earlier, as well.

The country is one of several large developing nations that are somewhat off the main thoroughfares of global trade and transportation, which seemed to have delayed arrival of the virus.

Foreign tourists and Indians returning from abroad accounted for the bulk of the cases until last week, when officials began to acknowledge that the virus had started to spread among the domestic population.

India is also for the first time moving to allow private companies to provide testing for the coronavirus, after confining all testing to government labs. That, and the country's tight restrictions on who was tested, had resulted in some of the lowest testing rates of any country.

Mr. Modi said essential services, grocery stores and banks offering limited services would remain open.

The prime minister underscored how some of the world's leading economies have strained to contain the pandemic, despite their robust health-care systems, so it was imperative to take lessons from them.

""Social distancing seems to be the only option to combat coronavirus. There is no other way to be safe,"" Mr. Modi said.

Yet achieving the sort of distancing that countries like Italy and China have maintained will be challenging for India, many of whose citizens live in tightly packed slums in megacities such as Mumbai and Delhi. Many of the country's poorest earn the money they need to buy food the day they eat it.

Mr. Modi's announcement of the lockdown led to panic buying of groceries and medicines in several parts of the country.

The prime minister said in a tweet the federal and provincial governments would ensure availability of essential commodities.

To mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic, the federal government is working on an economic package that will be announced soon, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in a televised press conference on Tuesday.

Most of the state governments in India have drawn up plans to provide free or subsidized food to millions of poor beneficiaries, as well as providing advance pensions payments and financial support to the poor for several months.

""We are front-loading our expenditure . . . to ensure people have sufficient money during this tough time,"" Thomas Issac, finance minister of the southern state of Kerela, told The Wall Street Journal.

The federal government has also asked states to dole out cash incentives to around 35,000 workers in the construction industry who might be rendered jobless or have to stay at home because of the lockdown.

Bond Downgrades Begin Amid Economy's Freeze

Credit-ratings firms have issued a wave of downgrades for corporate and government bonds as they reassess the ability of borrowers to repay their obligations amid the coronavirus slowdown.

Credit-ratings firms like S&P Global Inc. and Moody's Corp. have stripped away some pristine triple-A marks or moved other supposedly safe investment-grade bonds into junk territory.

The moves reflect what Moody's has called a ""severe and extensive credit shock across many sectors, regions and markets."" S&P has said that ""the global recession is here and now."" Fitch Ratings is bracing for ""abrupt interruptions happening simultaneously across all major economies"" as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.

The downgrades themselves can add to the turmoil in bond markets, causing damage well beyond the change in ratings for the bonds.

Seeking to stop the negative momentum in markets, the Federal Reserve on Monday broadened its efforts to include plans to purchase corporate bonds with high ratings. It is unclear, however, whether the moves will stem further downgrades.

Among the bonds facing potential downgrades are those tied to shopping malls, hotels, airlines, risky corporate borrowers and local governments. The reviews by ratings firms come after years of easing rating assumptions across various sectors.

Even in the face of such a severe stress, a triple-A grade should stay put since the rating is meant to indicate the debt is as riskless as a Treasury bond. But some triple-A bonds are already failing that test.

On Friday, S&P took away the triple-A grade from a $215 million bond backed by two mortgages on a giant mall in upstate New York. Local officials had ordered the mall, Destiny USA, and others in the area to be closed to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Other states are taking similar steps.

S&P's move was part of a larger downgrade of 60 securities linked to various malls. The Destiny-linked triple-A bond is now rated single-A by S&P. A spokesman for Destiny didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Destiny's downgrade calls into question a popular transaction in which bond investors agreed to buy a deal backed entirely by mortgage payments from one property or borrower instead of a pool of loans. Last week Fitch placed all of its single-asset, single-borrower hotel deals on watch for possible downgrades.

By its own tally, S&P has now made more than 100 downgrades linked to the coronavirus, including on airlines like JetBlue Airways Corp., Southwest Airlines Co. and Spirit Airlines Inc.

Companies that have already been struggling are seeing their woes worsen. On Monday, S&P downgraded office-share company WeWork deeper into junk territory, citing its mounting cash flow and liquidity pressure. The high-profile SoftBank Group-backed company was already under stress after its failed initial public offering last year prompted a previous round of rating downgrades.

On Friday, Fitch said it would stress-test all of its ratings on structured securities known as collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, and warned it may put some on watch for negative rating actions. The deals often buy up loans from highly leveraged companies and sell bonds to investors backed by payments on those loans. S&P said it is reviewing 25 ratings from 15 CLO deals with large exposures to energy sectors for possible downgrades.

Municipal bonds tied to specific projects or taxes are also being downgraded. S&P recently cut the ratings on revenue bonds backed by a student housing project in Corpus Christi, Texas, by six notches, taking the debt from the lowest notch of investment-grade deep into junk territory.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Coronavirus Strikes at the Italian Family --- Tradition puts older generations at greater risk; 6,820 have died, most were over 60

ROME -- The first call came on March 11. That's when Roberto Biglioli says he found out that his 81-year-old mother, Giuseppina, had passed away after battling the new coronavirus.

The second call came six days later, says Mr. Biglioli, a medical worker from near Bergamo, a northern Italian city hit hard by the pandemic. ""A call that, while expected, no one would ever want to receive in their lifetime,"" he said. ""My dear dad has also left us.""

Italians across the peninsula are terrified their own parents or grandparents will be next. They have reason to worry. Covid-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, has killed more people in Italy than anywhere else in the world, and the victims were overwhelmingly over 60.

Now, the whole country is hunkering down to protect them. The severe restrictions placed on daily life are shaking the very bedrock of Italian society: The Italian family.

Italy's way of life makes it unique in the West. It also left the country more vulnerable to the pandemic.

Two or three generations often live under the same roof, more so than in other parts of Western Europe. It's common for grandparents to look after their grandchildren on a daily basis, and for their adult children to look after them, once they become older. Now, efforts to combat the virus are putting an enormous strain on this social safety net.

""Our habits need to change, and they need to change now,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said on March 10, when Italy became the first Western country to impose a nationwide lockdown. ""We all need to give something up for the good of Italy. When I speak of Italy I speak of the people who are dear to us, our parents, our grandparents.""

Italy's 60 million residents are forced to stay at home unless they can prove they need to be out, for instance to work or to buy essential goods, like groceries or drugs. Italians over the age of 65 -- around 14 million people, nearly a quarter of the population -- are discouraged from doing even that. Everyone else has been told to stay away from them.

Umberto Cremasoli, 77, and his wife used to see their twin granddaughters almost every day. After doctors discovered a coronavirus infection near their hometown of Casalpusterlengo on Feb. 20 -- the first in Italy's outbreak -- the elderly couple saw the two toddlers even more than usual.

The government responded to the outbreak by shutting down all schools and nurseries in their area. So the elderly couple looked after the two toddlers while their parents worked. As the number of sick in the surrounding region of Lombardy continued to rise, even seeing the children became too risky.

These days, no one is allowed into their apartment, not even their grandchildren, as they too could be carriers. The couple never go out. They have groceries and drugs delivered to their front door.

""We live in terror,"" said Mr. Cremasoli. ""'You may have it and you may infect me.' That's the feeling we all have.""

Before the outbreak, Mr. Cremasoli and his wife had an active social life. His wife, Maria Antonietta Scarioni, 68, used to meet up with friends at a local cafe almost daily. She also took Spanish language classes and ballroom dancing lessons at a community center for the elderly.

She knows of at least three people from the community center who got sick, two of whom died.

""It turned our life upside down because we are forced to stay at home,"" she adds. ""But we have to follow the rules.""

Global data shows that the new coronavirus is much deadlier for the old than it is for the young. That's particularly troubling for Italy, which has the world's second-oldest population after Japan.

Of the nearly 69,200 people who are known to have been infected with the virus in Italy, 6,820 have died. So far, the disease has spared children and teens, with zero deaths recorded under the age of 20, according to data from Italy's National Health Institute, the country's top disease-control body.

The number of dead starts climbing rapidly after the age of 60. In Italy, some 16% of people in their 70s who have tested positive to the coronavirus so far have died. For those in their 80s, the percentage is even higher, 24%.

The true fatality rates are likely lower, even within those age groups, since testing for the virus is mostly limited to those who show clear symptoms, meaning a possibly vast number of cases are not being counted, according to health experts.

In Lombardy, the northern region at the heart of Italy's outbreak, the health-care system is so overstretched that doctors aren't able to treat all patients who need care. In towns such as Bergamo and Brescia, doctors have been forced to choose who to give the last available beds in intensive-care units, privileging the younger and healthier patients over the older and frailer ones.

Aware that their older relatives might get only limited medical treatment, the priority for many Italian families is to make sure they never get sick at all.

Gianna Besson, 70, has been housebound for over two weeks, ever since her two sons forbade her from leaving her flat in Rome's Trastevere neighborhood. One of her sons lives in her same building, but is frantic about not coming near her. He leaves food and medicine for her outside her door, rings the bell and disappears before she has a chance to open it.The cleaning lady no longer comes.

""They decided I have to remain cooped up in my flat because I am more at risk than they are. I am reluctantly complying with their orders,"" says Ms. Besson.

Loneliness has been the hardest thing to get used to for Ms. Besson. ""I feel the need to have physical contact with someone. It doesn't even have to be a hug, it could just be the touch of a hand,"" she says. ""I'm very tempted to leave the house with the excuse of having to go to the pharmacy. I'm very tempted. If I didn't have children, I would've gone out.""

In the northern city of Turin, in the foothills of the Alps, 64-year-old Anna Marcone is doing everything she can to insulate her 94-year-old mother from the outside world. The physiotherapist had to suspend their twice weekly sessions. The hairdresser, who came once a week, has stopped coming, too. Medical checkups have also been put on hold.

These days, it's Ms. Marcone who helps her mother with physiotherapy and who does her hair. ""I've become a perfect coiffeuse,"" says Ms. Marcone, who has lived with her mother for decades. Until two years ago, so did her son Paolo.

""She's been such a big part of my life that I don't even consider her my grandmother. She's more than that,"" says Paolo Mussa, 31, who until last week would join his grandmother for regular meals.

""The least you can do is to protect them,"" says Ms. Marcone. ""We are very conscious of what they did for us, so we are happy to be doing this for them. Love makes everything easier.""

Multigenerational households like Ms. Marcone's are much more common in Italy than in other Western countries. In Italy, around 23% of between the ages of 30 and 49 live with their parents, compared with just 6.4% in the U.S., 5.2% in the U.K or 1% in neighboring France, according to data compiled by the University of Bonn.

Such living arrangements risk increasing the exposure of the elderly to the virus. Close contact between members of different generations in Italy could help explain why so many old people here are dying, according to a new research paper on the transmission of Covid-19, which found a correlation between countries where multigenerational households are common and higher fatality rates.

""If you share a house, it's very likely that other people will get it. But it applies more generally: What role do grandparents play in everyday life, in the organization of families?"" says Christian Bayer, a professor of economics at the University of Bonn who co-wrote the paper. ""It's not that in northern Europe you lock away the elderly, but maybe you don't meet them on a day-by-day basis.""

Italy's experience is a warning sign for other regions where the virus is beginning to take hold with similar setups and traditions, such as the Middle East and Southern Europe.

Mr. Biglioli, the medical worker who lost his parents, says sacrifices are worth it.

Like many Italians, Mr. Biglioli lived in the same small town as his parents. His father Angelo was the unofficial photographer of Romano di Lombardia, a town of some 20,000 people south of Bergamo, documenting christenings, weddings and daily life there. Photography is a skill he taught his son and his grandson, Michele, from a young age.

""He used to gift me disposable cameras and take me into the darkroom with him,"" recalls Michele Biglioli, 28, who -- along with his parents and younger brother -- lived with his grandparents until the age of 14.

He continued to see them almost daily until a few weeks before they died, and took pictures of the aging couple.

""They were my main subjects,"" says Michele. ""My grandparents were like parents to me. They were friends, a shoulder to lean on. When the world turned against me, they were always there for me.""

When the couple developed the first symptoms, health authorities instructed them to self-isolate. No doctor came to visit them. Giuseppina Oggioni passed away in her home on March 11. Later that same day, Michele, his younger brother and their father rushed Angelo Biglioli to the hospital, in a last, desperate attempt to save him.

In the waiting room, Angelo stroked Michele's hand and told them all he loved them. They never saw each other again.

""Only leave your homes if you absolutely have to,"" says Roberto Biglioli.

""Do it out of respect for those who are no longer here with us, those who died because of this damned virus,"" he says. ""Do it for those who are fighting for their lives in hospitals all over Italy. Above all, do it for yourselves.""

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Workers, Businesses to Soon Feel Economic Pinch

The American economy is in a race against time.

With measures to halt the spread of the virus intensifying, the U.S. is embarking on its sharpest downturn since at least the end of World War II. The states where nonessential businesses are shut down account for more than 40% of U.S. gross domestic product.

Many of those workers and businesses will face severe constraints quickly, surveys suggest. In two weeks time -- the period of a typical paycheck -- many workers will struggle to make ends meet. After a month, more than half of them could be in trouble. At that point, a fifth of small businesses with lost sales could be on the brink.

The stimulus the Federal Reserve announced will help. So would the fiscal spending package from Congress.

For the economy, the most important questions are how soon help will arrive, how ample it will eventually be and, above all, how long the coronavirus crisis will last. Between the big stimulus and plans by lenders to extend loans or offer grace periods on payments, consumers and businesses can manage a shutdown lasting several weeks.

Beyond that is uncharted territory. Most economists think the economy will shrink more than 10% in the second quarter, at an annual rate. But most are assuming that by the start of summer, the spread of the virus will have been contained and activity will begin to bounce back. That is no sure thing.

Small businesses, which account for about half of U.S. employment, according to the Small Business Administration, are among those most at risk. In a 2016 study, researchers at JPMorgan Chase Institute found that the median small business had a cash balance that would last just 27 days. Some were operating closer to the edge. The median retailer had a cash buffer that would last 19 days. The median restaurant's would last 16.

Many consumers can't last very long without a paycheck, either. In a survey conducted last year by research organization NORC at the University of Chicago, 31% of working adults said missing a single paycheck would mean that they couldn't cover necessities. An additional 20% said they couldn't miss more than one paycheck.

Many households also carry substantial debt. This month, the Federal Reserve reported that overall household debt stood at a record $16.1 trillion at the end of the quarter. While overall debt to income ratios are down, that is because mortgages have fallen since the financial crisis. Lower-income households, which are less likely to have mortgages, have higher levels of debt than before the crisis.

Industries employing low-wage workers play a big role in the economy. Food and beverage stores have seen a surge in sales and won't be affected by a shutdown. But they employed a seasonally adjusted 3.1 million workers as of February. Restaurants and bars, many of which have been ordered closed, employed 12.3 million.

Even a giant stimulus might not quickly temper the downturn because government payments could take significantly longer to arrive than the two weeks the Treasury Department has forecast. Evercore ISI strategists and former White House and Treasury officials Sarah Bianchi and Ernie Tedeschi suggest six weeks is more realistic.

Contagion Spreads at Rikers Island Jail --- Officials urge release of at-risk inmates, as dozens of staff and prisoners are infected

The new coronavirus is spreading quickly through the Rikers Island jail complex in New York City, killing one Department of Correction employee and infecting dozens of inmates and staff who go in and out of the facility, said jail and health-care officials.

As of Monday, 50 inmates at Rikers Island had tested positive for the virus, according to the city's Department of Correction and its regulator, the Board of Correction. Thirty jail workers also had tested positive for the disease, city officials said. Just two days earlier, on Saturday, only 12 corrections workers and 19 detainees had tested positive, city officials said.

A Department of Correction investigator died March 15 after contracting the coronavirus, city officials said.

Overall, 14,776 people have tested positive for the virus in New York City, resulting in 131 deaths, city officials said Tuesday morning. Federal officials said the New York metro area had become a hot spot for the spread of the virus.

The outbreak has prompted Rikers Island officials to take new steps to fight the disease, including barring visitors to inmates.

Mayor Bill de Blasio coordinated with the city's district attorneys for the release of hundreds of inmates deemed at-risk for the virus. Some of the city's district attorneys, including prosecutors in Manhattan and Brooklyn, said they would stop prosecuting low-level offense to help stop overcrowding in jails.

But some jail officials and defense attorneys warned that the steps aren't enough to ensure the safety of staff and inmates at city jails, including the main facility at Rikers Island, where roughly 5,300 people are incarcerated, mostly while awaiting trial.

Ross MacDonald, chief physician of Rikers Island and chief medical officer of the New York City Health + Hospitals' Correctional Health Services, has urged officials to release as many inmates ""as you possibly can.""

""We cannot socially distance dozens of elderly men living in a dorm, sharing a bathroom,"" Dr. MacDonald wrote on Twitter on March 18. ""Think of a cruise ship recklessly boarding more passengers each day.""

Health officials warned city correctional officials in early March about Rikers' potential to become an incubator for coronavirus. Before the outbreak picked up speed this month, more than 5,000 inmates were housed in Rikers regularly.

Defense attorneys, union officials and members of the Board of Correction called for releasing inmates and safer working conditions for jail employees.

In a letter to prosecutors and correction officials on Saturday, interim Board of Correction Chair Jacqueline Sherman urged them to ""rapidly decrease"" the jail city population and ""immediately remove from jail all people at high risk of dying of Covid-19 infection.""

New York's largest criminal-defense organization, the Legal Aid Society, filed a lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court on Tuesday on behalf of 32 individuals in pretrial detention or being held on parole violations.

The suit seeks the immediate release of the inmates on the grounds that continuing to incarcerate them constitutes deliberate indifference to the risk of serious medical harm in violation of the 14th Amendment and state constitutional rights to due process.

The city Law Department didn't respond to a request for comment on the suit.

U.S. News: States Scramble to Meet Record Unemployment Claims

Americans are waiting anxiously for unemployment benefits as state unemployment systems adjust to record-high levels of claims in the wake of the new coronavirus.

States say they are waiving waiting periods for accruing benefits and bulking up with staff to field calls and quickly process claims. But the unemployment-insurance system wasn't designed to move as quickly as the coronavirus is knocking the U.S. labor market off course.

""States are at a historically low level of administrative funding, but processing a historically high level of claims,"" said Michele Evermore, policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project, which advocates for lower-wage workers. ""There are mechanisms to staff up quickly, but it's never smooth, easy or perfect.""

Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal estimated that 1.5 million new jobless claims were filed last week. The U.S. Labor Department will release a national compilation of claims on Thursday. The highest number of new claims on record is 695,000 filed in the week ended Oct. 2, 1982.

Georgia's labor department website tells applicants to expect to wait. ""Due to an extremely high volume of unemployment claims filed as a result of the Covid-19 outbreak, individuals may experience a delay in requesting weekly benefit payments,"" the website said Monday afternoon.

Ohio's call center and website to register for unemployment benefits experienced hiccups earlier on Monday.

""This system was not built for a crisis,"" said Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted at a news conference. ""It was built to take care of what we could expect on a regular or even robust basis.""

Tunc Samli, 46 years old, was laid off in early March from a Washington, D.C., company that arranges passports and visas for corporate clients. He tried every day last week to apply for unemployment benefits on the district's website but the site would crash.

On Monday, he waited on hold for two hours trying to reach someone at the Department of Employment Services, but no one answered. ""That's a frustration,"" he said. ""I'm waiting and no one is answering, and I need information.""

Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said at a news conference Tuesday that those calling for claims assistance are likely to experience long hold times. The city's claims website works on computers, but not on cellphones, frustrating users.

Kelly Medina, 57, applied for unemployment benefits in Colorado last week when the coronavirus shut down the restaurant where he worked. As he understood it, it would take four to six weeks to receive his first unemployment check, and he didn't see any guidance from Colorado's labor department that the waiting period to receive benefits would be shortened.

""If it takes too long, maybe I need to look for a different career,"" he said. But added, ""there's nobody hiring right now.""

Colorado residents who successfully submitted their claim online early last week should receive a benefit payment this week, a spokeswoman for Colorado's labor department said.

On Monday, Colorado's labor department added 90 staff members to the customer call center and plans to add more.

The federal government and states should look at promoting lesser-known programs in the unemployment insurance system as a way to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on workers, said Katharine Abraham, a University of Maryland labor economist and former economic adviser to President Obama.

In 26 states, covering about 70% of the workforce, states can pay unemployment insurance benefits to two workers who share a full-time job by each working part time. The concept is common in Europe but little used in the U.S. At the end of February, 11,564 workers received work-share benefits, versus 2.1 million in regular state programs that typically require a person to be laid off before accessing jobless payments.

Potential $15 Billion Revenue Hit in N.Y.

State revenue could fall by as much as $15 billion as a result of the novel coronavirus and its effect on the economy, New York's top budget official said.

New York State Budget Director Robert Mujica, an appointee of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, said the state expects gross domestic product to shrink in the second quarter of this year and possibly beyond.

Last week, Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli estimated state revenue would decline by $4 billion to $7 billion; Mr. Mujica said his latest estimate is a decrease of $9 billion to $15 billion.

The drop comes as state lawmakers work to develop a new spending plan before the state fiscal year ends on March 31. In January, Mr. Cuomo proposed a $178 billion budget, of which $105.8 billion covered operations. It assumed roughly $88 billion in state revenue, mostly from personal income taxes.

In an interview Monday with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Mujica said the Democratic governor's original proposal is ""no longer viable,"" absent massive assistance from the federal government to maintain planned outlays for school aid and public-worker salaries.

As a result of the continued uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Mujica said, the governor is seeking legal authority from state legislators to make unilateral budget adjustments during the fiscal year if revenue declines.

""I think what's critical in the budget is for the legislature to give us the tools to be able to stabilize our finances and make the decisions in the budget to bridge us through this,"" Mr. Mujica said.

Spokesmen for Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins didn't respond to a request for comment about Mr. Mujica's statement.

Budget negotiations were already contentious before the virus struck. Mr. Cuomo set up a task force to reduce Medicaid spending by $2.5 billion to help bridge a $6.1 billion deficit. He also said he would change the state's new bail law -- which eliminated cash bail for most misdemeanor and nonviolent felony offenses -- and legalize recreational marijuana as part of the budget.

Mr. Cuomo said Monday that he would still like both items included in the budget. State Sen. Liz Krueger, a Democrat from Manhattan who sponsors a bill to legalize marijuana, said there were still disagreements about how to distribute new revenue and that lawmakers might be better off waiting to try to negotiate a solution.

The governor's task force on Medicaid recommended decreasing the reimbursement rates for hospitals and nursing homes.

Some legislators are calling for raising taxes to plug the existing deficit. Mr. Cuomo said last week he opposed any tax increases. Mr. Mujica said state income taxes are disproportionately paid by the highest-earning New Yorkers, who were severely affected by downturns in the stock market.

""With negative growth, taxes don't appear to be the answer,"" Mr. Mujica said. ""You can't get blood from a stone.""

Judge Backs Regulator On Coins

WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission prevailed in a key stage of its cryptocurrency enforcement crackdown, as a federal judge issued an injunction halting Telegram Group Inc. from distributing its digital coins.

U.S. District Judge P. Kevin Castel wrote the SEC had shown a ""substantial likelihood of success"" in prevailing against Telegram, which was accused of breaking investor protection laws when it sold $1.7 billion in cryptocurrency. Dubai-based Telegram and other startups pushed forward with lucrative, unregulated fundraisings despite the SEC's warnings in 2017 they were subject to rules restricting how companies raise capital.

Telegram's argument that its deal was exempt from oversight because its investors were sophisticated venture capitalists didn't win over Judge Castel. The judge wrote that the success of the deal depended on allowing those investors to resell the digital coins to the public. The injunction halts that process while the litigation plays out. The judge didn't conclusively rule for the SEC, despite the agency's request that he do so.

The court fight carries high stakes for the SEC, whose enforcement division has mostly chased scammers that fleeced investors with fake crypto projects and startups that raised a few million dollars without following SEC rules. Telegram had the advice of a Wall Street law firm before raising funds, while the investors in its digital-coin sale included the Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers as well as executives from Fortress Investment Group and SoftBank Group Corp.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Global AIDS Warrior on the Front Lines --- Deborah Birx is a central player in the Trump administration's fight against the virus

Deborah Birx was leading an AIDS conference in Johannesburg on Feb. 27 when she received a call from the State Department summoning her to Washington to help combat a new disease that was about to change the way that all Americans lived.

In less than a month, Dr. Birx has become a central player in the Trump administration's fight against the pandemic and a mainstay in the coronavirus task force's public White House briefings, urging people to recognize the severity of the threat.

""Can we communicate effectively enough so that the American people take these guidelines seriously?"" Dr. Birx asked in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. ""Because that's the only thing that's going to change the course of this pandemic.""

As the U.S. coronavirus response coordinator, Dr. Birx has been a regular presence at the White House, invariably wearing colorful scarfs that she said she has collected along her international travels and that are representative of ""the global community response that's needed now.""

A global-health expert on immunology and vaccine research, Dr. Birx has spent decades combating the spread of HIV/AIDS. Since 2014, she has served as ambassador-at-large in the State Department as the U.S. global AIDS coordinator, managing an effort across multiple government departments.

""It's why they sought her out for this particular role,"" said Brian Honermann, the deputy director of public policy for Amfar, an AIDS research foundation, who has worked closely with Dr. Birx. ""The ability to coordinate across different agencies.""

Dr. Birx, 63 years old, grew up in Philadelphia and earned a medical degree at Pennsylvania State University. Her father was an electrical engineer, her mother a nursing professor -- an apt background for a daughter who ultimately would apply mathematical models to public-health problems, using numbers to combat illness.

Dr. Birx served 20 years as an Army doctor, attaining a colonel's rank while working on immunology and vaccine research at the Pentagon and the National Institutes of Health. She led the military's HIV research program at Walter Reed Army Medical Center before leaving the service in 2005 to join the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The George W. Bush administration had recently established the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or Pepfar, to coordinate the aid and assistance that the U.S. government disbursed internationally to combat and contain the disease.

As the director of HIV/AIDS initiatives at CDC, Dr. Birx administered about half of Pepfar's program, and in the process built a far-reaching network of global public-health officials.

""She's a very good manager,"" said Tom Frieden, who was CDC director from 2009 to 2017. ""She's politically very savvy. She works hard. And she's very focused on achieving results.""

In 2014, Dr. Birx effectively received a promotion when then-President Obama appointed her to lead Pepfar as the fourth U.S. global AIDS coordinator. Still serving in that position, she oversees a budget of $4 billion.

""She drives a hard program,"" Mr. Honermann said. ""She expects outcomes. She has a vision of what needs to happen.""

Dr. Birx is one of the few remaining Obama appointees in the Trump administration.

When the coronavirus appeared in China last year, Dr. Birx was particularly concerned about its possible spread, according to a senior coronavirus task force official. She had worked in that country during the SARS epidemic of 2002-03 and had witnessed the troubles it had wrought. She also realized that the subsequent increase in international travel among upwardly mobile Chinese might exacerbate the scattering of this new virus, the official said.

After the virus jumped China's borders, Dr. Birx was in touch with officials on the newly formed White House coronavirus task force.

The task force, then led by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, was charged with developing the administration's program to mitigate the spread of the virus. Dr. Birx began feeding general epidemics and modeling data to her colleagues to assist the effort, the task force official said.

As the epidemic began to take root in the U.S., President Trump installed Vice President Mike Pence to lead the task force. Dr. Birx was quickly on a plane from Africa.

As the administration has at times struggled to maintain a consistent message, Dr. Birx occasionally has been caught in the middle. During a White House briefing on March 13, she held up a flow chart illustrating a Google project that Mr. Trump said was imminent. However, the announcement was premature, given the project isn't complete. The White House had previewed the announcement with Google to ensure accuracy, a person familiar with the matter said. Google representatives didn't respond to a request to comment.

Mayor Tightens Budget, as Finances Squeezed

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called on city agencies to make cuts to services as revenue drops and the cost to fight the novel coronavirus rises.

Mr. de Blasio this week said he is looking to trim $1.3 billion through the agencywide cuts. The city's budget office on Tuesday began working with agencies to establish cost-savings plans.

It is a rare budget trimming for the mayor, who has grown the city's budget each year since taking office in 2014. But with the state also expecting a big drop in revenues, and without guaranteed help from the federal government, New York City will have to look out for itself, he said.

""We are on our own at this moment trying to sort it out,"" Mr. de Blasio said. ""We know the state's going through a real tough time, so we have to take actions to protect our most vital services.""

The city is hoping to avoid layoffs with other cuts, the mayor said.

Comptroller Scott Stringer released a report Monday that predicts the city could lose between $4.8 billion and $6 billion in city tax revenues, depending on how long the pandemic lasts, as well as the restrictions put in place to stop its spread.

The biggest losses will come from personal incomes, sales, hotel, business incomes and other taxes, he said.

""We are staring down a fiscal emergency and need the federal government to step up by injecting as much funding into our city's economy as possible -- our health-care system, infrastructure, transit network, and so much more depend on it,"" the mayor said.

Property taxes -- the biggest revenue generator in the city -- are due April 15. Mr. de Blasio said this week that the city badly needs the revenue, but on Tuesday he reminded property owners about aid programs such as a deferral-payment program for those who qualify.

""Revenue is being stressed very, very deeply,"" he said Sunday. ""It is not my instinct to take away other forms of revenue because we literally will not be able to pay for basic services.""

The independent watchdog group Citizens Budget Commission called on the mayor to increase the target for savings to $3 billion, as the city faces unprecedented uncertainties.

""It needs to be much bigger than what's been done in the past and it needs to be focused on efficiency,"" said Maria Doulis, of the CBC. The current economic pause and shutdown is different than anything the city has ever seen, she added.

In January, Mr. de Blasio presented his $95.3 billion preliminary budget, which was in the process of being evaluated by the City Council when the virus began to spread.

The council canceled its budget hearings because of the crisis. The final executive budget must be approved by the end of June.

Banks Can Do More, But Let's Be Careful

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

If the Federal Reserve's latest round of massive liquidity injections don't succeed in unclogging markets, it may be faced with another tough choice: whether to lift more constraints on banks.

Monday morning's announcement of bond purchases and another bevy of measures to lend beyond banks and directly to credit markets to help facilitate small-business consumer lending appear to have calmed the market for the moment. Now the next ""break-glass-in-case-of-emergency"" maneuver might be altering some of the constraints put in place after the 2008 financial crisis.

As massive as the dollar figures have been for the Fed's daily interventions in the repurchase agreement, or repo, market, at times they were like buckets of water being poured over a funnel: Only so much could reach their ultimate beneficiaries -- companies and investors grasping for cash.

The funnel in this analogy is banks. The Fed's daily repo operations, at times as much $1 trillion on offer, have only seen a portion of those amounts taken up. That isn't necessarily a good sign. The liquidity is still needed, but it is having a hard time moving through the system, having to pass first through the primary dealers, which include the likes of big banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Citigroup, as well as smaller firms that may use those banks for clearing.

These repo operations aren't just paperwork. Dealers have to expand their balance sheets to take advantage. For example, though dealers may in many cases be taking on offsetting positions with the Fed and with clients, it still increases their total exposure relative to their capital -- a form of leverage.

Banks have regulatory limits, their own limits and the market's implicit judgment on how leveraged they can be, which in effect limits how much repo they can channel.

The Fed may ultimately need to release banks from more constraints on their balance sheets, as it has done in some respects for their liquidity. Already, for example, banks that make purchases of assets from money-market funds to support them using money from the Fed's backstop facility will be able to exclude those assets from capital calculations. This particular design makes sense, as those would now be essentially riskless assets with the government's credit guarantee.

But to ensure that banks don't themselves become new overleveraged problems, the Fed needs to keep making sure that whatever banks need to load onto their balance sheet for the sake of the system isn't just compounding risk or leverage in the system.

For bank investors, relaxing leverage rules to buy government-backed assets is a mixed blessing. They can worry less about banks setting off regulatory alarm bells, but it also may mean they are taking on low-profit activities, like repo intermediation, that will cost them to administer. It will be extremely difficult to model banks' profitability in the future.

But that certainly beats fretting about banks' survival.

U.S. News: Outbreak Causes Delays on Death Row

WASHINGTON -- The coronavirus pandemic is disrupting executions planned for the spring, providing an unlikely reprieve for condemned inmates whose appeals were nearly exhausted.

Last week, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals issued 60-day stays for two men scheduled to die this month, citing ""the current health crisis and the enormous resources needed to address that emergency."" In Tennessee, the state Supreme Court is weighing a petition seeking a six-month reprieve for Oscar Franklin Smith, who is slated to die June 4.

Inmates in other states with calendered executions are expected to file similar actions, said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonprofit that is critical of capital punishment and compiles widely accepted statistical data about the practice.

The prisoners' concern, Mr. Dunham said, is that emergency restrictions on movement across the nation are impeding the ability of their lawyers to investigate and prepare the last-minute appeals and clemency applications that typically are filed after death warrants are issued.

""It's dangerous for the investigators to go out to interview people and it's dangerous for the people they want to interview,"" he said. ""Because it would be medically and professionally irresponsible to proceed, all the investigations in those cases have come to a halt.""

One condemned Texas inmate, John William Hummel, 44 years old, who had been scheduled to die on March 18 for the 2009 killing of his pregnant wife and his father-in-law in Kennendale, Texas, argued in legal papers that his execution could itself help spread the coronavirus.

""Executions are solemn and stressful affairs [that] involve a substantial number of people functioning in various roles,"" his motion says. ""Gathering all these people in one location presents a substantial risk of transmission of Covid-19/Coronavirus if anyone is infected.""

Prosecutors wrote in reply that whatever Mr. Hummel's ""concern for the health and safety of others who will participate in or witness his execution,"" he lacked legal standing ""to complain on their behalf.""

Despite the state's assertion that it was ready to go ahead with the execution, the Court of Criminal Appeals issued a stay on March 16.

World News: Saudis Indicted in Killing

ISTANBUL -- Turkish prosecutors indicted 20 Saudi nationals, including two with ties to the Saudi crown prince, on charges related to the killing of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey.

Prosecutors on Wednesday said they had completed their investigation into the death of Mr. Khashoggi, who was killed inside Saudi Arabia's consulate general in Istanbul in October 2018. They charged a former deputy intelligence chief and a former royal adviser with instigating the killing and 18 other people with torture and deliberate murder.

After the Central Intelligence Agency said the kingdom's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, likely ordered the journalist's death, some Turkish officials said he should be included in the scope of any indictment.

The crown prince has cast the Khashoggi killing as a rogue operation and denied involvement. A Saudi official didn't return calls seeking comment. Turkish prosecutors, however, accused only the former deputy intelligence chief, Ahmed al Assiri, and the former royal adviser, Saud al Qahtani, of plotting Mr. Khashoggi's killing.

Police Enforce Virus Restrictions

The coronavirus emergency in New York City has led to a blitz of inspections by police officers to crack down on socializing and dining out.

New York Police Department officers have conducted more than 66,000 inspections of businesses, public parks and other sites in the city, for violations of virus-related mandates since March 17, police officials said.

The NYPD has been tasked with ensuring the public follow a number of directives issued by New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, including rules that prohibit the operation of bars and restaurant dining rooms, mandate the closure of many businesses and order the dispersal of gatherings of any size.

Police officers have taken enforcement action in only a handful of cases. Since enforcement began, officers have issued 63 warnings and five summonses and made two arrests. Messrs. de Blasio and Cuomo have said gatherings in parks remain an issue.

NYPD Chief of Patrol Fausto Pichardo said in an interview Wednesday that officers have encountered widespread compliance with the new rules, which continue to be updated.

""It's pretty fluid and happens very quickly,"" Chief Pichardo said of officers' enforcement of the rules. ""New Yorkers are adapting and being very compliant with us.""

Chief Pichardo said NYPD officers conduct daily inspections of sites located within their usual patrol areas to take advantage of officers' knowledge of neighborhoods and previously established relationships with residents and business owners. The NYPD has about 36,000 uniformed officers on patrol, police officials said.

The officers regularly visit businesses, restaurants and bars to ensure they aren't serving patrons on site, Chief Pichardo said, and have encountered relatively few establishments breaking rules. A handful of illegal bars have been cited, he said, including an unlicensed bar in Queens where a bartender and bouncer were arrested on Saturday. Patrons at the bar were admonished, he said.

After Mr. Cuomo issued a set of rules on Friday that mandated the close of nonessential businesses to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, Chief Pichardo said some salons and barbershops misunderstood the new edict and continued to operate. Officers issued warnings to 31 of those establishments in the days after Mr. Cuomo's order, he said, but noncompliance has since become rare.

Compliance with rules prohibiting gatherings in parks and mandating social distance of at least 6 feet between individuals has proven more troublesome. Elected officials including Mr. Cuomo have said that too many New Yorkers continue to congregate in city parks. Mr. de Blasio has said he is considering a decision to close public playgrounds if the crowds persist.

Chief Pichardo said officers have encountered few prohibited gatherings, with the exception of pickup-basketball games. Most often, he said, officers simply tell players to disperse and they comply.

Banking & Finance: Bank Stress Tests Pale Next to the Pandemic's Wallop

Teams inside the nation's biggest banks are hunkered down, working out how they would handle a nightmare economic scenario dreamed up by the Federal Reserve. Turns out, reality is worse.

The annual stress tests for the biggest banks, due April 6, are meant to gauge if banks would survive a hypothetical recession that sends the stock market plunging, oil into a tailspin, loan defaults rising and unemployment to society-shattering highs.

In recent years, the banks looked strong enough to manage those conditions, giving regulators comfort that the U.S. financial system is stable. In turn, banks have been allowed to return billions of dollars to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.

The new coronavirus has some wondering if this year it is even worth it.

Some economists are predicting that the current downturn could be sharper and reach further than the worst-case scenario on this year's test, which the Fed refers to as ""severely adverse.""

""The severely adverse scenario looks pretty rosy right now,"" said Pete Gilchrist, executive vice president of Novantas Inc., a bank services company.

For instance, the Fed's severe recession imagines U.S. gross domestic product dropping 9.9%, unemployment hitting 6.1% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling to 18623 by the end of June.

Last week, Goldman Sachs economists projected a 24% drop in second-quarter GDP, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said unemployment could hit 20% without government intervention. The Dow closed at 18592 Monday, then rallied to 21201 Wednesday.

Bank stocks have been hit harder than the broader market as industry profits are likely to plunge and loan losses jump.

But so far, analysts, bankers and the public don't broadly have the same worries they did during the 2008 financial crisis about whether big banks would survive. Banks have spent much of the past decade shoring up capital levels, and they have reined in some of their riskier activities after a regulatory crackdown.

As of now, the banks and Fed are operating as scheduled, even as the central bank is also rolling out extraordinary measures designed to keep markets functioning. The Fed on Tuesday said it would relax some examination work, particularly at smaller banks, but that big banks should still submit their plans.

In the stress tests, the Fed devises two scenarios: one a baseline and one that is generally a spiced-up version of 2008. It hands the banks spreadsheets detailing how the stock market, income and other metrics would collapse and then slowly recover. The banks run their models to figure out how they envision using capital, including dividends and share buybacks, and then hand the Fed reams of data it uses to run its own models. This year, how the banks perform will determine the capital level they must stay above.

The banks at this point have mostly run their models, and it is too late to insert the world's far more alarming crisis, people familiar with the process said.

Bankers are telling the Fed the results, typically released in June, will be irrelevant given how rapidly coronavirus has slammed the brakes on the economy and the unknown impact that will have on everything from consumer spending to bank balance sheets. The big lenders already have temporarily halted buybacks after the coronavirus was declared a pandemic.

Next in Line Are Poor, Unprepared Nations

The new coronavirus is now taking off in the world's poorest countries, which join the battle with even fewer weapons than developed nations, some of which have fumbled the pandemic's early stages.

From Venezuela to Pakistan to the Democratic Republic of Congo -- and nearly every developing country between -- confirmed cases have started to spike in recent days, a sign the contagion is advancing exponentially, disease-control experts say.

""Extraordinary action is required if we are to prevent a human catastrophe of enormous proportions in our country,"" said President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, among the nations hardest hit by the 1980s AIDS epidemic. Addressing the country Monday night, he announced a 21-day nationwide lockdown to be enforced by the military.

South Africa on Wednesday declared 709 confirmed cases of coronavirus, a number the government said has risen sixfold in a week and could rise to hundreds of thousands without decisive action.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, ordering a nationwide shutdown, said Tuesday in a televised address: ""I appeal with folded hands, don't come out of your homes.""

China, where the outbreak began, had its powerful government to throw at the coronavirus, which across the globe as of Wednesday had infected more than 450,000 and left more than 20,000 dead with Covid-19, the disease the virus causes, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. the World Health Organization. South Korea could react quickly thanks in part a technologically sophisticated economy. And the West despite its struggles, has robust health-care systems, wealth and deep-rooted institutions to battle the contagion's spread.

The world's poorest areas -- Africa, parts of Latin America, and Southeast and South Asia -- start with few of those advantages. Their health-care systems and social mechanisms to fight the virus often aren't just at risk of being overwhelmed, many join the epidemic already overwhelmed.

Off the beaten track of global trade, these countries initially saw a slower rate of infections. Now the number of confirmed cases is surging.

Cases have suddenly spiked in Pakistan, with 210 million people and a per capita daily income of $3.50, spurred partly by its proximity to Iran, a middle-income nation slammed by the virus. By Wednesday morning, cases there had doubled from fourdays earlier to 991, official figures showed, a growth rate health experts say indicates rampant spread of the disease.

According to an internal Pakistani government assessment, if steps aren't taken to stem the spread of the virus, cases could reach 20 million in the country.

Cases in Africa on Wednesday rose to more than 2,400 in 43 countries, according to the African Union, triple the number -- and in one-quarter more countries -- than on Friday. The African Union released data Saturday mapping the first 40 days of infection that suggested the continent is on the same trajectory as European nations, where the virus has exploded.

A dozen African nations are experiencing community transmission, the phase when the disease spreads rapidly within a locale without massive efforts to slow it through lockdowns and social distancing, according to the World Health Organization.

Cases in India have risen nearly fivefold, from 114 on March 16 to 562 confirmed cases on Wednesday. Without taking mitigating steps, India would have 300 million to 400 million cases before July's end, according to Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, a think tank based in Washington and New Delhi. He said that after India's announcement on Tuesday of a 21-day shutdown, those figures could be reduced by 80%-90%, depending on compliance.

India ""is in the very early stage of the avalanche,"" said T. Jacob John, a retired professor of virology at the Christian Medical College in Vellore, India.

Testing levels are so low in many developing countries they could be sitting on an unknown monumental problem. Indonesia had tested 7.4 people out of every million as of March 20, according to figures collated by Our World in Data, a research project. South Korea had tested at a proportion 800 times higher by the same date, an approach credited with helping it gain control over the spread.

It isn't inevitable that the coronavirus will have a worse impact in the developing world, and some factors could mitigate its impact in the poorest countries. Africa has the world's youngest population -- average age, 20, according to the U.N. -- and South Asia's populations are nearly as young; Covid-19 mortality rates rise rapidly above age 65. There is hope, but no clear evidence so far, that generally hotter climates will hamper the virus's spread as with the flu once summer comes.

Some nations have strong militaries that could enforce mitigation measures or already have. Militaries in Sudan and South Africa will be on the streets enforcing lockdowns. Pakistan on Monday called out its military, the country's most powerful institution, to deal with the crisis.

The vulnerability most of these countries share is giant urban slums where hundreds of millions live with poor sanitation and no plumbing. Basic practices to prevent the virus's spread, such as regular hand-washing, can be impossible given the scarcity of clean water. Residents crowd into vehicles to reach jobs that often barely cover food and shelter. Some 587 million Africans, almost 60% of the continent's urban residents, live in such slums, according to the United Nations.

Aggravating their vulnerability is the number living with other diseases -- underlying conditions susceptible to Covid-19. An estimated 2.5 million people in South Africa with HIV aren't taking antiretroviral drugs. India's rates of diabetes are high, as are respiratory issues from air pollution.

On Johannesburg's outskirts in the mud-strewn alleys of Diepsloot, an informal settlement of roughly 400,000, there isn't much debate about what will happen if the virus takes root. Blessing Nyondo, a gardener living in a one-room house with five family members, said it would quickly overwhelm the area's meager services: ""We don't have access to the basics, let alone enough to deal with a crisis.""

Nearby, people queued to use fetid public toilets and communal taps.

""Social distancing is impossible here,"" said Peter Ndlovu, on his way to the taxi rank. ""We are supposed to be two meters apart but we live side to side.""

For many of the world's estimated 70 million refugees, the conditions are worse. Sprawling camps in more than a dozen African nations, some housing up to 250,000 people, are regularly plagued by disease and violence. Some refugee settlements can't provide shelter from conflicts that could intensify during the virus outbreak.

When leaders do act in anticipation of a coming crisis, the efforts can collide with on-the-ground realities, as Congo found. Doctors there were expected next month to declare victory over a three-year Ebola epidemic that ripped through rural communities. These teams of health professionals, experienced disease fighters with no illusions about the challenges, are redeploying to cities in preparation for the coronavirus.

Yet when doctors set up a quarantined section of the country's largest hospital in Kinshasa, population 12 million, other patients fled onto the streets when the first Covid-19 patient arrived.

Dr. Diafuka Saila-Ngita, a Congolese infectious-diseases expert, expects his team to be overwhelmed. ""You cannot call yourself a soldier if you have never been to war,"" he said. ""We have been to war and the most recent outbreak [of Ebola] gave us a lot of lessons, but Covid is a bigger challenge.""

Much of the Congolese population has refused to heed government warnings, crowding bars and markets. Defying a state ban on large public gatherings, church services still welcome thousands. Commuters still pack ferries plying the Congo River dividing Kinshasa and Brazzavile, neighboring Republic of Congo's capital.

In Congo, ""There is a lot of misinformation about coronavirus in the country, this is exactly what we have been going through with Ebola,"" said Kate Moger, the regional vice president for International Rescue Committee in Congo. ""Many residents still believe coronavirus is a hoax, and this ultimately complicates response efforts.""

Other African countries are even less prepared: The continent has an average of two doctors for 10,000 people in cities, according to the WHO. By contrast, Italy, with 41 doctors per 10,000, is overstretched.

In South Sudan, the ministry of health says it has just 24 isolation beds for a country of 13 million. Malawi's health ministry says there are about 25 isolation beds in public hospitals serving 17 million. The main infectious-diseases hospital in Zimbabwe's capital, Harare, has none, according to the Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights.

Burkina Faso, under siege from jihadist groups, has said it doesn't have the resources to deal with the outbreak, even as it confirmed the death of its parliament's vice president from the disease and the infection of four cabinet ministers.

In Pakistan, officials saw early on the threat posed by the raging epidemic next door in Iran, one of the first countries the disease overwhelmed. Iran wasn't able to hold Pakistani pilgrims, who had visited the center of Iran's outbreak, the city of Qom, on its side due to the crisis there. Some 5,000 came pouring over to Pakistan at once, said Pakistani officials, who set up border quarantine camps to isolate them.

Only one building was available for quarantine use at the bordercrossing, which was soon so crowded people were sleeping in halls and tents. The camps devolved into filthy, little-monitored hubs of spread for the virus, according to some of those kept there. Pakistan's health minister and prime minister have conceded conditions there were poor but say the border is remote with few facilities.

As they arrive home, the people are being tested. Regional authorities have set up facilities where these returnees can be quarantined a second time. Seventy percent of Pakistan's cases have come from those who have passed through the Iran-border quarantine, according to provincial governments.

In many poorer countries, the starvation threat could outweigh the coronavirus specter, conspiring against mitigating measures. While Pakistan's four provinces, which have broad autonomy, moved independently to a lockdown by Monday, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan -- who has repeatedly warned against stringent lockdowns, saying that poor would suffer -- on Tuesday called the moves ""driven by fear that's led to overreaction.""

""If I was leading Italy or France, I would have no problem imposing a curfew,"" said Mr. Khan. ""But here, if you can't provide food, at the doorstep, to those who live in slums, a curfew can't work.""

Pakistani authorities announced Tuesday the country would provide 10 million poor households with $20 a month to help cope with the shutdown.

In the ramshackle Gadap Town district of Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, Shakila Asghar works at a towel-manufacturing factory, paid only on days there is work. Those living around her can afford at most two or three days of food before working to buy more, she said, adding that those in Karachi's factories typically earn $2.60 to $3.80 a day.

""We don't know if we will get this virus,"" she said, ""but what I do know is that we get hungry three times a day.""

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Europe Splits Over Proposed New Debt to Fight Virus

European leaders are preparing to spar Thursday about whether to issue common debt to counter economic pain from the new coronavirus and ease pressure on embattled countries such as Italy, reviving memories of the region's sovereign-debt crisis nearly a decade ago.

Europe's response to the fast-moving economic crisis has so far been uneven, with rich northern countries, including Germany, unveiling massive fiscal-support packages aimed at shielding businesses and workers, while those in the highly indebted south employ more modest measures. That status could aggravate an economic gap that ultimately threatens the future of the currency union.

In an effort to bridge that gap, the leaders of France, Italy, Spain and six other countries called in a letter Wednesday for the creation of a common European debt instrument that could support weaker countries.

""The case for such a common instrument is strong since we are all facing a symmetric external shock for which no country bears responsibility,"" said the letter, which was sent to Charles Michel, president of the European Council, which groups leaders of EU countries. Funds generated could be used to finance investments in health care and ""temporary policies to protect our economies and social model,"" the leaders wrote.

But officials in the more prosperous north have indicated they are skeptical of efforts to mutualize debt across the region, worried about hostile political reactions at home and legal obstacles. They warn that the eurozone needs to ensure it has funds available if the crisis deepens, and that disputes about new instruments will only delay concrete action by individual governments or from existing EU budgets.

German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, an ally of Chancellor Angela Merkel, cautioned in a newspaper interview this week against ""ingenious new ideas that are often the return of long-rejected concepts,"" calling the debate about eurobonds a ""ghost debate.""

The increasingly fractious debate underscores how some of the big, structural faults in the architecture of the eurozone, including legal and political constraints on common action, have festered beneath the surface for years, unresolved.

During the region's sovereign-debt crisis starting in 2009, countries including Greece, Portugal and Spain struggled to pay their debts until they were bailed out by other eurozone governments, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank.

Today, government debt in France and Spain is around 100% of annual economic output, and it exceeds 130% of gross domestic product in Italy and Greece, according to data from the IMF. That limits those countries' firepower compared with countries such as Germany and the Netherlands, which both have around 50% debt-to-GDP.

Wednesday's letter is ""quite a confrontational step,"" indicating frustration in a number of European capitals about the lack of progress on joint action, said Guntram Wolff, director of Brussels think tank Bruegel. The letter could fuel fears of a renewed eurozone crisis, he said. ""I'm not quite sure it is helpful.""

The virus is buffeting economies and prompting the closure of hundreds of thousands of businesses across Europe, but its impact has been especially fierce in the south. Borrowing costs for governments in Italy, Spain and Greece surged last week as investors worried that their debts might become unsustainably high as they battled the crisis. That prompted a swift response from the European Central Bank, which last week unveiled a new 750 billion euro ($815 billion) bond-buying program to help support governments and businesses.

Rule Gives Banks Headache --- Lenders are supposed to write down loans as soon as risk outlook changes

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

Some of the rules introduced to protect banks after the 2008 financial crisis are aging better than others in the 2020 one.

European regulators are working furiously with their region's banks to keep its financial system ticking as Western economies are hit by the coronavirus shutdown. Many of the regulations forged in the meltdown 12 years ago have proved effective, but there is one clear exception: an accounting change pushing banks to write down loans earlier.

On Friday, the European Central Bank urged lenders to ""avoid excessive procyclical effects"" when applying the new rule. The Bank of England raised similar concerns and promised more guidance this week.

The old regulations allowed banks to delay write-downs until a borrower failed to pay, which in 2008 led to uncertainty about the true state of banks' loan books. Group of 20 leaders requested new methods to provide more timely credit-risk information in a crisis.

International Financial Reporting Standards -- used in Europe, Britain and more than 100 other countries -- started applying its new rule in 2018, called IFRS 9. It forces banks to make provisions on every loan from the start. The allowance can be quite low initially, but lenders must impair loans more aggressively as soon as a credit risk ""increases significantly.""

In the U.S., which uses Generally Accepted Accounting Principles rather than IFRS, similar rules -- Current Expected Credit Losses -- are set to come into force this year requiring the full lifetime-expected credit loss to be booked when a loan is made. Officials are concerned and have sought to delay the implementation.

The IFRS rule seeks to build buffers as problems arise, but in an unforeseen economic crisis -- as most major ones are -- it forces banks to write down many loans just as things get tough. That procyclicality was accepted because it also would provide an updated view of the lender's loan book, much like requirements to routinely adjust investments to their market value.

Banks carefully calibrate their risk-weighted assets and capital levels to drive returns on equity. That means lenders forced to make a big loan-book write-down in the midst of a crisis might just stop lending and instead focus on rebalancing their books. That is exactly what governments don't want right now. Instead they need banks to lend to businesses so they can survive the economic standstill.

Last week ratings agency Fitch warned of a ""cliff-edge effect"" from the IFRS 9 rules.

European bankers have persistently grumbled about postcrisis regulations, but the higher capital requirements have been a success so far. Banks are stronger now than in late 2008. Annual stress tests have also helped, identifying weaknesses to be fixed and building confidence in banks' ability to withstand crises.

But IFRS 9 clearly needs work. Bank finance directors would like to follow the prudential regulators' advice to look through the new rules, yet they must still produce first-quarter numbers that will keep their auditors happy. The risk for investors is that the coronavirus crisis could force lenders to raise capital for what proves to be a temporary challenge.

The new accounting standard was designed to give an updated view of credit risk in a crisis. The scramble to find workarounds during an actual crisis suggests it isn't fit for purpose.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Indicting the Caracas Mob

The world isn't stopping because of the coronavirus, and on Thursday the U.S. escalated its pressure on the thugs running Venezuela. This raises the stakes for dictator Nicolas Maduro and his Cuban backers who continue to oppress Venezuelans even as the virus may spread to Latin America.

The Justice Department indicted Mr. Maduro and four of his lieutenants on charges related to drug-trafficking, money laundering and corruption. It also indicted two leaders of the terrorist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia -- FARC -- who signed a supposed peace agreement under the guidance of the Obama Administration in 2016 but are alleged to be in cahoots with the Venezuelans, who are also charged with narco-terrorism.

The U.S. has offered a $15 million reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Mr. Maduro and $12 million for Diosdado Cabello, head of the dictatorship's constituent assembly. Mr. Cabello sued this newspaper in U.S. federal court for libel in 2016 for reporting that he was under Justice investigation on suspicion of drug-trafficking and money-laundering. In 2017 a judge dismissed the case.

The indictments come more than a year after the U.S. recognized Venezuelan interim President Juan Guaido and as Venezuelan oil is fetching $10-$15 a barrel in international markets. Mr. Maduro, whose term expired in January 2019 and was not legitimately re-elected, has refused to allow new elections. The economy has crumbled, and 4.5 million Venezuelans have fled the country, creating a migration crisis in South America.

Mr. Maduro increasingly relies on Cuba's intelligence services for security and organized crime for income. The Justice Department alleges that the heart of all this is the Cartel of the Suns, a drug-trafficking operation named for sun-shaped stars on the uniforms of military and headed by Mr. Maduro.

""The scope and magnitude of the drug trafficking alleged,"" U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said Thursday, ""was made possible only because Maduro and others corrupted the institutions of Venezuela and provided political and military protection for the rampant narco-terrorism crimes described in our charges.""

Most drug-trafficking is done for profit, and Mr. Berman alleged that ""the defendants betrayed the Venezuelan people and corrupted Venezuelan institutions to line their pockets with drug money."" He also alleged that ""Maduro and the other defendants expressly intended to flood the United States with cocaine in order to undermine the health and wellbeing of our nation. Maduro very deliberately deployed cocaine as a weapon.""

The U.S. rarely indicts heads of state, not least because they can become more reluctant to leave power. But the indictment means Mr. Maduro can be arrested anywhere for trial in America and sends an important signal to the people of Venezuela that the U.S. supports its democratic aspirations.

Washington's Trillions Can't Stop Job Loss

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

The massive jump in U.S. unemployment insurance claims doesn't tell you precisely how bad the hit to the job market is going to be. It does show that it is going to be horrible.

The Labor Department on Thursday reported the number of American workers filing new claims for jobless benefits last week rose to 3.28 million from 282,000 a week earlier. Nothing in the 53-year history of the series comes close. In the worst week of 2009, when the job market was reeling, initial claims hit 665,000.

Worse, the 3.28 million in new claims doesn't reflect all the people who were pushed out of jobs last week as the novel coronavirus crisis emptied out Main Streets and shut businesses down. Many state labor departments have been inundated with people filing for claims, so not everybody who has tried to file has been able to get through. Many workers take time before filing for benefits, and some don't even know whether they qualify. Many freelance and gig workers don't, although provisions in the $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill the Senate approved late Wednesday, will, after passing through the House and White House, change that.

The actual scope of the job losses won't be known for some time. Even measures such as the unemployment rate won't entirely capture it since people must be seeking work to be counted as unemployed. How many people are doing that in a coronavirus shutdown?

But for all that, the weekly claims report did give an early reading on the sheer awfulness of what is happening and a sense of the magnitude of the challenge the U.S. economy faces. Many of the people who have lost their jobs will struggle to stay afloat even with unemployment checks and the additional money they will receive under the Senate's relief package. They will reduce spending, as will workers who worry that they will be next. That will in turn pinch businesses so far relatively unaffected by the crisis. In the worst-case scenario, business failures could cascade through the economy, leaving many workers without jobs to return to once the threat from the coronavirus has passed.

Washington is writing a huge check but still hasn't figured out how to stop that vicious circle.

Working After the Coronavirus

So much for full employment. That ended this month with the attack of the coronavirus and Thursday's record spike of three million new jobless claims. Millions more will follow in the coming weeks, and the goal of public policy should be to get them back to work as soon as possible -- not to keep them on the government's unemployment tab.

That point may seem obvious but you wouldn't know it from this week's flap over the enhanced jobless benefits in the Senate's $2 trillion coronavirus relief bill. The bill increases unemployment benefits for all workers by $600 per week for the next four months. Even the liberal Economic Policy Institute says this expansion would provide a ""100% replacement of wage income for the bottom half of the workforce."" Some will earn more by not working.

Republican Senators Ben Sasse, Lindsey Graham, Tim Scott and Rick Scott warned that this might hurt small employers in their states by encouraging workers to stay at home for longer. Speaker Nancy Pelosi called them ""cruel"" -- the word is her version of Donald Trump's ""incredible"" -- and the media echoed her.

The Senators are right if you know anything about labor markets and incentives to work. Jobless benefits are administered by the states, each of which sets its own eligibility requirements and payment levels. Benefits are typically based on a worker's prior earnings and limited to between 50% and 70% of a state's average weekly wage. The maximum benefit runs up to $823 in Massachusetts while the minimum is as low as $10 in Louisiana for low-earners.

The current economic crisis is like no other because government has literally forced hundreds of thousands of businesses to shut down. And because so many workers are likely to lose their jobs, more generous benefits will cushion the short-term blow. But the goal should be returning people to private payrolls when the crisis passes, and the risk is that benefits at 100% of wages for the long term will do the opposite and slow the recovery.

The blunt Democratic solution, which Republicans too easily agreed to as a price of the bill, is to give all laid-off workers a $600 benefit increase on top of their normal unemployment compensation for up to four months. So workers will now make at least $15 an hour (assuming a 40-hour workweek) and as much as $35 an hour in places like Massachusetts -- for not working.

Amazon, Walmart, CVS and delivery services are seeking to hire hundreds of thousands of workers to meet a surge in demand even as the virus spreads. Many are boosting pay, but how are they supposed to compete with workers who can stay at home and make more?

The experience after the 2008-2009 recession is instructive. Congress repeatedly extended unemployment benefits, which expire after 26 weeks in most states, to up to 99 weeks until December 2013. The national jobless rate stayed high far longer than in a typical recovery and the incentive not to work is one reason.

The economic evidence on this incentive point isn't controversial or partisan. In March 2010 economists at the liberal Brookings Institution reported that jobless insurance extensions ""correspond to between 0.7 and 1.8 percentage points of the 5.5 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate witnessed in the current recession.""

The enhanced benefits expire after four months, but we'll bet Speaker Pelosi's pension that Democrats will be back demanding an extension through the end of the year and calling Republicans ""cruel"" if they disagree. America needs an economic recovery from the virus recession that is faster and stronger than the last expansion. That means helping laid-off workers for the short term rather than providing a reason not to return to work.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Singapore, Among First to Be Hit, Girds for Recession

Singapore said it is bracing for what could be its deepest recession, while European data showed tumbling business and consumer confidence, as evidence mounts that the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic is getting worse.

Singapore is among the first to report official growth statistics. Its open, trade-dependent economy makes it something of a bellwether of global economic health. It also was among the first nations outside China to be affected by the virus.

Singapore's economy shrank 10.6% in the first three months of this year, advance estimates showed Thursday. The figure is annualized, is adjusted for seasonal differences and compares activity with the previous quarter.

The government slashed full-year forecasts to a contraction of between 1% and 4%, down from a growth range of between negative 0.5% and 1.5%. That downturn could surpass 1998, when the economy shrank 2.2%, the worst year since it became an independent republic in 1965.

""We are heading towards uncharted territory now,"" DBS economist Irvin Seah said.

Previous slowdowns were due to sharp falls in demand, exacerbated by poor consumer and investor confidence. This time, economic activity also is being directly disrupted by strict measures imposed by many countries to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at OCBC Bank in Singapore, said the three key sectors of manufacturing, services and construction contracted in the first quarter while the economy was facing both demand- and supply-side challenges.

""All engines of growth have stalled,"" she said, adding that the first quarter probably wouldn't mark the low point.

Neighboring countries also are struggling.

In Thailand, the central bank on Wednesday slashed its full-year forecasts to a 5.3% contraction in gross domestic product, down from the 2.8% growth it predicted in December. It cited challenges in tourism, exports, supply chains and trading-partner slowdowns.

India's government Thursday unveiled $22.5 billion in spending to help the poor survive a nationwide shutdown to slow the spread of the virus.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the nation would boost the amount of food and cash it gives to the two-thirds of the country's 1.3 billion citizens who are most vulnerable. The package includes free staple grains such as wheat or rice for about 800 million Indians during the next three months.

""We have to ensure nobody remains hungry and also not without any money,"" she said.

The government would provide insurance coverage of 5 million rupees ($66,500) each to about two million health workers, in addition to one-time payments of 1,000 rupees to nearly 30 million senior citizens, Ms. Sitharaman said.

India had recorded 649 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 13 deaths as of Thursday. The number of positive cases has risen more than fivefold since mid-March, prompting the government to order a complete lockdown of the nation for three weeks until April 14.

In Europe, French data on Thursday showed business confidence is at its weakest point since 1989 when records began, while a survey by market research firm GfK showed German consumers are more downbeat. The Netherlands and Ireland were advised by economic-research institutes to expect declines in output this year in excess of 7%.

Business News: Lodging Giant Oyo Unwinds Revenue Promise to Hotels

Oyo Hotels & Homes, which built itself into the world's second-biggest hotel chain by room count, is phasing out a tool that fueled its rise.

The India-based company and a key investment by SoftBank Group Corp.'s $100 billion tech fund grew quickly in part by offering independent hotel owners the unusual perk of guaranteed revenues if their hotels joined Oyo's chain.

Many hotels signed up, attracted by the guarantees -- sometimes at more than 100% of the previous year's revenue, according to former Oyo employees. However, some hotels didn't produce sufficient bookings, leaving Oyo on the hook to meet those revenue levels and resulting in disputes with some hotel owners.

Now, Oyo is ending the practice of awarding those guarantees around the world and instead is rolling out new contracts for its hoteliers without them, Chief Executive Ritesh Agarwal told The Wall Street Journal. The new contracts also raise fees charged to the hotels, according to some hotels and former Oyo employees.

Mr. Agarwal said the company is taking the step largely because the guarantees have served their purpose of convincing hotels that Oyo could boost their occupancy and revenue. But he said Oyo had some problems with the guarantees, particularly in its biggest market of China, and that around 15% of Oyo's rooms still had them as of the beginning of the year.

""In reflection, we are able to see that minimum guarantees work, but only when they are handled with great care,"" he said. Oyo's share of the money guests pay for their rooms is on average more than 15%, after any losses on the guarantees are subtracted, he said.

Oyo -- which lost around $335 million in the latest fiscal year, ended March 2019 -- is under pressure to become profitable. But Oyo's moves to curb subsidies and raise fees have driven some hotels out of the chain as the global tourism industry is reeling from the coronavirus pandemic.

The abrupt turn to focus more on profits was urged by SoftBank's Vision Fund, which is Oyo's controlling shareholder, people familiar with the matter say. Following the multibillion-dollar losses on office-share company WeWork last year, the fund has been telling other cash-burning portfolio companies to show a path to profits.

If Oyo fails to do so, it could lead to another write-down for the Vision Fund. Oyo also is taking other steps, including laying off thousands of employees world-wide, in a bid to slash costs.

The coronavirus pandemic adds to Oyo's challenges. As bookings are canceled, Oyo could wind up owing more to its hotel partners to fulfill its revenue guarantees unless it restructures the deals soon.

Oyo said it is offering temporary financial aid to some hotels in Southeast Asia and new joiners in Japan. It also is offering discounts on some rooms to bring in guests, and may temporarily delay some of its efforts to restructure contracts with hotels in China and Japan to help them until conditions improve, according to former staffers as well as internal messages reviewed by the Journal.

The company's business model is built around persuading hotels to join Oyo's platform, which uses homegrown booking technology to optimize occupancy rates.

In return for Oyo's guarantee of minimum revenues, hoteliers granted Oyo control over room pricing and a cut of the money from bookings. Oyo said its 80-country network last year spanned more than 40,000 hotels and a million rooms, behind only Marriott International Inc. in room count.

U.S. News: G-20 Vows To Contain Fallout

WASHINGTON -- The leaders of the Group of 20 nations said that they would collectively spend more than $5 trillion trying to insulate the global economy from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and help speed a recovery.

The commitment to coordinated stimulus was the largest the G-20 members have made since the global financial crisis of 2008 and 2009, an event that prompted creation of the leaders' summits.

Back then they met in Washington and then London. On Thursday's call, they spoke by videoconference, reflecting the changed nature of the threat to the global economy.

""We commit to do whatever it takes and to use all available policy tools to minimize the economic and social damage from the pandemic, restore global growth, maintain market stability, and strengthen resilience,"" the G-20 said in a statement.

The group didn't put forward a specific plan to address the coronavirus challenge, perhaps reflecting the limited time that it had to arrange the session in face of the rapidly spreading pandemic.

""They would have needed a lot of time to come up with a detailed action plan,"" said Maurice Obstfeld, a former International Monetary Fund chief economist. The statement is ""long on generalities, short on specifics.""

The G-20 is an informal collection of countries that make up about 80% of the global economy, according to calculations by Homi Kharas, a Brookings Institution economist.

The group has no independent power but tries to coordinate actions and generally relies on the IMF and World Bank to act as its staff.

During the videoconference, leaders read their formal statements and approved the group communique, said people familiar with the meeting. There was little give-and-take. During in-person summits, most of the substantive meetings occur on the sidelines of the sessions. During the last two in-person G-20 meetings, in Buenos Aires and Kyoto, President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping met to try to end their continuing trade war. They arrived at truces, which didn't hold.

The group's inclusiveness makes it difficult for it to act. For instance, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been trying to use the session to convince Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to end its oil fight with Russia, which has driven down energy prices. But the G-20 also includes oil importers like India, which may prefer to keep prices low and Russia, which may not be willing to back down from its confrontation with Saudi Arabia.

There wasn't a mention in the statement of oil or energy policy.

The group did, however, say that they were expecting global trade to play a big role in any recovery.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said the U.S. economy ""may well be in a recession,"" but that the central bank is taking unprecedented action to help ensure economic activity can resume as soon as the coronavirus pandemic is under control.

""The virus is going to dictate the timetable here,"" Mr. Powell said in a rare television interview, on NBC's ""Today"" show Thursday morning. ""The first order of business will be to get the spread of the virus under control, and then resume economic activity.""

Mr. Powell said he expected economic activity to decline ""pretty substantially"" in the second quarter.

The Fed's job now, he added, is to make sure businesses of all sizes can have a ""bridge"" of support, including through emergency lending programs the Fed has been rolling out, so that the economy can recover faster.

Retirement Report: IRA Strategy Takes Advantage of Market Fall

The market's recent plunge has been brutal.

But for people with traditional individual retirement accounts, the silver lining is that today's lower account balances can be used to reduce income-tax bills in retirement.

The key is a strategy known as the Roth conversion. This allows account owners to transfer some or all of the money in a tax-deferred IRA to a Roth IRA, a retirement account into which you contribute after-tax dollars and get tax-free withdrawals.

Although you will have to pay income tax on the transfer, due to the tax cuts enacted in 2017 many people stand to pay a lower tax rate today than they would by deferring the payments until retirement, says William Reichenstein, a professor at Baylor University and a principal at Income Strategy, an online service that helps retirees plan tax-efficient withdrawals.

""It's a good time to think about a Roth conversion,"" said Prof. Reichenstein. The decision, he added, comes down to a comparison between your current marginal tax rate and the rate you are likely to pay in the future.

With asset values beaten down and income-tax rates scheduled to increase in 2026 when the tax cuts enacted in 2017 expire, ""there is a window now where it's super-attractive in my opinion for most people to consider conversions,"" said Robert Jeter, an adviser in Salisbury, Md.

Why bother converting? Once you hold a Roth for at least five years and are age 59 1/2, future withdrawals of both principal and appreciation are tax- and penalty-free. Moreover, you won't ever have to take a required distribution from a Roth (although beneficiaries who inherit these accounts must take them).

With a traditional IRA, individuals generally get to subtract contributions from their income and reduce the taxes they pay.

Amounts in the IRA then grow tax-free, but account owners must pay ordinary income tax on the money when they withdraw it in retirement. With a Roth IRA, there is no upfront tax deduction. The money grows tax-free and can be taken out tax-free.

In retirement, people with Roth accounts can take tax-free withdrawals to supplement their taxable income and stay within a lower tax bracket. Some may be able to use Roth withdrawals to reduce the portion of their Social Security benefits that are subject to income tax, or reduce or avoid the surcharges on Medicare premiums that kick in above $87,000 in income for individuals and $174,000 for couples.

To make a Roth conversion worthwhile, the account owner should ideally pay the tax using money outside the IRA, said Ed Slott, an IRA consultant in Rockville Centre, N.Y.

""If you convert $100,000 and use $25,000 of that to pay the taxes, you will have paid for a $100,000 conversion, but will only get $75,000 of value,"" he said. (Those under age 59 1/2 will also owe a 10% penalty on the $25,000 withdrawn to pay taxes.)

For many people, a more palatable approach is to convert just enough from a traditional IRA to make full use of their current income-tax bracket.

For retirees, the best time to do Roth conversions is before claiming Social Security and taking required minimum distributions from traditional 401(k)s and IRAs. Those distributions start at age 70 1/2 (for those born before July 1, 1949) or at age 72 (for those born after June 30, 1949) and can't be converted. So once retirees start taking them, it is harder to do Roth conversions without ending up in a higher tax bracket.

Prof. Reichenstein said retirees who convert in the early years of retirement, when their taxable income is low, may be able to ""make their portfolios last up to seven years longer.""

Here's how to do it:

Step 1: Consider a man who retires at age 62 with $1.3 million in assets, including $1 million in a regular IRA and $300,000 in a taxable bank or brokerage account.

If he plans to spend $75,600 in 2020 and adjust the amount annually for inflation, the conventional solution is to claim Social Security at 62 and withdraw the rest from the taxable account.

A better approach is to put off claiming Social Security, said William Meyer, chief executive of Retiree Inc., which owns Income Strategy.

Step 2: In the interim, Mr. Meyer says the man should withdraw the $75,600 he needs from the taxable account. If that account holds cash or can be liquidated without triggering much in the way of capital gains, the retiree will find himself in a low tax bracket -- and the $300,000 account will support him for about four years.

Step 3: From 2020 to 2025, he should convert enough money from his tax-deferred IRA to fill the 22% tax bracket each year and deposit the money in a Roth, where it can grow tax-free.

Assuming the man is able to convert roughly $365,000 before tax rates increase in 2026, the Roth IRA will grow to about $430,000 by the end of 2025, calculates Mr. Meyer, who assumes a 4.86% annual return.

The Result: As the Roth's balance grows, the man's tax-deferred retirement account will shrink -- to about $700,000 from $1 million over five years due to the conversions.

Beginning in 2026, when tax rates rise, the man should change his withdrawal strategy, by taking out enough from his tax-deferred IRA to fill the 15% bracket -- and using the Roth to cover the rest.

That will help him reduce taxes on his Social Security.

To see why, consider what will happen in 10 years, when the man begins taking required distributions. If he waits to claim Social Security until age 70, by 72 he will receive over $40,000 in benefits -- or 77% more than he would have gotten if he had claimed instead at 62, says Mr. Meyer.

From a tax perspective, a bigger Social Security benefit is good news. Why? The formula that determines how much of an individual's Social Security is taxable counts traditional IRA and 401(k) distributions more heavily than Social Security income.

By reducing required minimum distributions from IRAs, retirees with after-tax incomes between $40,000 and $90,000 may also reduce or eliminate taxes on their Social Security benefits, Mr. Meyer said.

Thanks to the Roth conversions, the man is also likely to reap other tax benefits. Because his tax-deferred IRAs will be smaller, when required distributions begin at 72, the withdrawals -- and the taxable income they create -- will be lower.

And he can use tax-free Roth withdrawals to supplement his income in years in which taking more from the traditional IRA would push him above the 15% tax bracket. The tax savings are likely to extend the life of his portfolio for as long as five years, Mr. Meyer figures.

The Internal Revenue Service has issued guidance filling in many details of the historic delay in this year's tax-filing and payment deadlines, which have been extended to July 15 from April 15 for many taxpayers due to the coronavirus pandemic. The agency also announced key delays to enforcement actions.

Among other things, the agency clarified that the deadline for making contributions to individual retirement accounts and Roth IRAs is now July 15; that returns with automatic filing extensions are still due Oct. 15; and that there are ways for filers to delay automatic tax payments they previously scheduled for April 15.

The IRS also said it generally won't start new audits, and it will suspend in-person meetings with taxpayers under exam through July 15. It also won't submit the names of delinquent taxpayers to the State Department for potential restrictions on their passports.

Here's what to know about the July 15 tax deadline and changes to IRS enforcement actions.

Q: Will my tax refund be delayed until July 15?

A: No. The IRS is processing refunds now, as in a typical tax season.

Q: I already filed my 2019 return and scheduled an automatic withdrawal of my tax payment for April 15. Will the IRS automatically delay this payment until July 15?

A: No, but taxpayers can take action to change the payment date.

Many filers authorize an electronic funds withdrawal as part of filing their tax returns. The IRS says these taxpayers can cancel their payment by contacting the U.S. Treasury Financial Agent at 888-353-4537. But payment cancellation requests must be made no later than 11:59 p.m. ET two business days before the scheduled payment date. Then reschedule the automatic payment or mail a check to the IRS.

Fewer taxpayers use IRS Direct Pay or the Electronic Federal Tax Payment System (EFTPS). Both have directions for canceling payments, which must be done two days before the payment date. For IRS Direct Pay, use the Look Up a Payment Feature. For EFTPS, log in and click on Cancel a Tax Payment.

Q: What if I need more time to complete tax paperwork and file my 2019 return?

A: Individuals can ask for an automatic extension of the time to file (but not pay) by filing Form 4868 by July 15. The deadline to file returns remains Oct. 15, 2020.

Q: Is my deadline to contribute to an IRA, Roth IRA, health savings account or Archer MSA also extended?

A: Yes, these deadlines are delayed to July 15 from April 15.

Q: I see that my first-quarter estimated tax payment due on April 15 is now due on July 15. What about the second-quarter payment, due June 15?

A: As of now, the second-quarter payment is still due on June 15. This could change.

Q: What doesn't qualify for the IRS's three-month delay?

A: Among other things: estate and gift taxes, excise taxes, information returns such as 1099 forms, and payroll taxes -- although Congress is considering a payroll-tax deferral. In addition, tax items that don't have April 15 deadlines, such as the March 16 due date for partnership returns, don't qualify for the extension.

For more information on this or other questions, check the IRS's FAQs devoted to coronavirus issues (go to IRS.gov and search on ""Filing and Payment Deadlines Questions and Answers"").

Q: Are state-tax deadlines also delayed?

A: A number of states have extended individual income-tax deadlines. For the latest information, go to aicpa.org and search on ""state tax filing relief chart.""

Q: Is the IRS stopping audits during the pandemic?

A: Not exactly. The agency says it generally won't start new audits before July 15, unless they are deemed to be important. While it will also suspend in-person meetings for audits in process, taxpayers should keep in touch with the IRS about these audits.

Q: What about other changes to enforcement actions?

A: For a full rundown, go to irs.gov and search on ""People First Initiative Covid 19.""

Among the changes: Liens and levies to collect taxes due, including seizures of personal residences, will be suspended between April 1 and July 15. Payments on existing installment agreements are suspended for the same period, although the interest on them will continue to accrue. The current interest rate is about 5%.

Retirement Plans Revisited In Senate Stimulus Package

The Senate's $2 trillion coronavirus-relief bill that passed Wednesday night includes breaks for Americans whose retirement accounts have been battered by the stock-market meltdown.

The House of Representatives is expected to pass the package on Friday. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said President Trump would sign the package as it was written Wednesday.

Provisions in the Senate legislation raise the limits on 401(k) loans and loosen the rules on hardship distributions from retirement accounts. People affected by the coronavirus crisis would get access to up to $100,000 of their retirement savings without the penalty for withdrawals taken out before age 59 1/2.

For retirees, the bill suspends for 2020 the minimum required distributions most must take from tax-deferred 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts.

For 2009, Congress enacted a similar measure to give beaten-down retirement accounts time to rebound without requiring retirees to take money out when their balances were low.

Retirement plans can allow people to use the new hardship distribution and loan provisions immediately. Here are details.

Hardship distributions

The ""hardship withdrawals"" of up to $100,000 would still be taxable, but account owners can pay the income tax due on the withdrawal over three years, rather than in the first year. And those under age 59 1/2 would be exempt from the 10% penalty that normally applies.

Alternatively, they can put the money back into a 401(k)-type plan or an IRA within three years, and skip the tax payments, even if the amount they want to redeposit exceeds the annual contribution limit, which is currently $6,000 for an IRA (or $7,000 for those 50 or older) and $19,500 for a 401(k) (or $26,000 for those 50 or older).

To qualify for the hardship distribution, the account owner or his or her spouse or dependent must have been diagnosed with the coronavirus or lost income due to a layoff, business closure, quarantine, reduction in hours, or inability to work due to a lack of child care.

The administrator of the account ""may rely on an employee's certification that the employee satisfies the conditions,"" the bill says.

Loans

The bill doubles the amount 401(k) participants who have been diagnosed with the virus or affected by economic losses can take in loans for the next six months from a retirement account to the lower of $100,000 or 100% of the account balance. (IRAs don't permit loans.)

People with 401(k) loans -- new or existing -- can delay any repayment due in 2020 for a year. That extends the repayment deadline for these loans by a year.

Required minimum distributions

Those who contribute to tax-deferred retirement accounts, such as traditional IRAs and 401(k)s, don't pay income tax on the money they put into these accounts. But starting at either age 70 1/2 (for those born before July 1, 1949) or at age 72 (for those born after June 30, 1949), the government requires them to start withdrawing a set percentage of the account balance, and paying income taxes.

Account holders can always withdraw more. But if they take less than the minimum required, they could be subject to a 50% penalty on the amount they should have withdrawn -- except for 2020.

The one-year suspension of required distributions will help retirees, who would otherwise have been forced to base their minimum withdrawals for 2020 on their account balances as of Dec. 31, 2019, when the stock market was near record levels.

Under normal rules, a 75-year-old with a $500,000 IRA evenly split between stocks and bonds on Dec. 31 would have been required to withdraw about $22,000 this year on top of losses so far of about $49,000.

The reprieve also gives those who can afford to leave their nest eggs alone a better chance of recovering losses. The reason: they'll have more dollars working for them in the event of a stock-market rebound, says Ed Slott, an IRA consultant in Rockville Centre, N.Y. People who have inherited 401(k)s, IRAs, or Roth IRAs can also suspend distributions in 2020.

Relief Measures

Criticized by Some

The financial-services industry pushed for the relief measures for retirement accounts, arguing that Congress should ""provide plan participants and retirees the flexibility they need to weather this unprecedented public health and financial crisis,"" said Matt Petersen, executive director of National Association of Government Defined Contribution Administrators Inc.

Some consumer advocates say, however, that the hardship provision may exacerbate savings shortfalls in the long run. Before the current market decline, the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute estimated Americans between the ages of 35 and 64 faced a retirement savings shortfall of $3.83 trillion, with 41% of households projected to run short of money in later life.

The provisions that govern 401(k) loans and suspend required distributions ""are quite sensible,"" said Shai Akabas, director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, D.C. ""But to have a blank check to take out $100,000 from a retirement account penalty-free sends the wrong message.""

Jobless Claims Surge As Contagion Spreads

Thursdays in late March are usually a flurry of activity at the Poughkeepsie Grand Hotel in New York as staff prepare for the weekend's weddings.

That was before the coronavirus pandemic forced cancellations and the hotel had to lay off more than 100 employees. This week, the front doors were locked, the lobby music turned off and the hallway lights dimmed to save electricity.

""We're literally in limbo and I think that's the worst thing that can happen,"" said the hotel's general manager, Maureen Kangas.

As expected, the number of people applying for unemployment benefits in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut skyrocketed in the week ended March 21 after governors in all three states ordered nonessential businesses to close to contain the spread of the virus.

Coronavirus infections continued to climb this week, with more than 39,000 confirmed cases in New York, 6,800 in New Jersey and 1,000 in Connecticut as of Thursday night.

In New York, about 80,000 claims were filed in the week ended March 21, a 463% increase from the previous week. The number of claims seemed low considering that the New York State Department of Labor reported receiving about 1.7 million calls and 2.3 million visits to its website that week. A spokeswoman for the department didn't make anyone available to comment Thursday.

David Cooper, a senior economic analyst at the think tank Economic Policy Institute, said unemployment claims in New York may be lower because many of the state's jobs, particularly in the financial and information sectors, can be performed from home. Still, he said the pandemic's impact on the workforce is so unprecedented that it will take awhile for economists to figure it out.

""It's going to take time to understand all these patterns that we're seeing in these data,"" he said.

New Jersey saw a 1,546% increase in claims week-over-week, with the 156,000 claims far surpassing the state's previous record of 46,000 claims filed in a single week in November 2012, after superstorm Sandy.

""It's shocking when you see the numbers,"" said Robert Asaro-Angelo, the state's labor commissioner. ""But the way I like to look at it is, the system is working. People pay into unemployment for this very reason.""

Laid-off restaurant and bar employees filed the most claims, followed by workers from doctor and dentist offices and personal and laundry services, such as hair and nail salons and dry cleaners, according to the state's labor department.

In Connecticut, unemployment claims increased 630% last week compared with the prior week, with about 25,000 people applying for benefits.

U.S. Cases, Jobless Claims Soar --- Number of infections across country pass China's count; New York remains epicenter

The U.S. has overtaken China as the country with the most cases in the world of the novel coronavirus, a new milestone in the fight against the global pandemic.

China had held the top spot since the deadly virus began spreading there in December.

There were 85,505 confirmed infections across America, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The first case in the U.S. -- a man in Washington state who had recently traveled to Wuhan, China -- was reported on Jan. 21. Within six weeks, the U.S. began to see a surge in new infections and the country's first deaths.

Fatalities in the U.S. from the new coronavirus hit 1,288 Thursday night.

New York is the center of the pandemic in the U.S., with its 39,125 infections accounting for nearly half of all cases in the country and tens of thousands more than any other state. The New York City metro area accounts for 35% of all new cases in the U.S., Deborah Birx, response coordinator for the White House's coronavirus task force, said in a briefing on Thursday.

By contrast, 19 states have fewer than 200 confirmed cases, Dr. Birx said.

To help state and local authorities decide whether to bolster or relax social-distancing measures designed to help stop the spread of the virus, the Trump administration is planning to issue guidelines categorizing counties across the nation as high risk, medium risk or low risk.

State officials have so far enacted a patchwork of rules to stop the spread of the virus, and cities have sought ways to decrease crowding in parks, trails and outdoor spaces. In Chicago, officials closed the city's Lakefront Trail and beaches Thursday, while the New York Police Department mobilized to crack down on socializing.

China said Thursday it will close its borders to nearly all foreigners and drastically slash international flights in a bid to curb the reintroduction of the fast-spreading coronavirus from abroad.

The near-blanket restrictions on international travel to China come after months in which Beijing expressed its opposition to similar curbs imposed by other countries on travel from China, where the pandemic first exploded.

The country has reported a sustained decline in the number of new domestically transmitted infections in recent weeks, even as infections have risen among people arriving from abroad. China had 81,782 total infections, according to Johns Hopkins data. Health authorities logged no new local infections on Tuesday and Wednesday, compared with 114 new imported cases over those two days.

The U.S. has only a fraction of China's population, with just over 330 million residents compared with 1.4 billion in China.

World-wide, there were more than 531,700 cases Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins data. Testing for the new coronavirus hasn't been uniform across the U.S. or globally, which affects total case counts.

Hospitals in U.S. hot spots including New York and Seattle have passed a tipping point, as a relentless surge in cases forces some to move patients to outlying facilities, divert ambulances and store bodies in a refrigerated truck.

The economy is also straining under the weight of the pandemic as employers lay off workers and state officials order nonessential businesses to close. A record 3.28 million U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, far surpassing the previous record of 695,000 set in October 1982.

Congress is aiming to give families and businesses a financial shield against the worst of the fallout, with the largest economic stimulus package in recent memory. The House is expected to consider the legislation, already approved by the Senate, on Friday. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin indicated that the government would take stakes in airline carriers in exchange for billions in direct grants to the companies as part of the stimulus package, according to people familiar with the matter.

Across the Atlantic, European Union leaders agreed late Thursday to ready options for further economic steps to respond to the crisis but pledged no specific new action.

After a fractious teleconference meeting that ran hours over schedule, leaders said eurozone finance ministers should present proposals on possible next steps within two weeks.

The European Central Bank, meanwhile, sent a powerful signal to investors that it would aggressively support indebted eurozone countries battling the coronavirus, starting purchases under a new 750 billion euro ($812.3 billion) bond-buying program and stating that it wouldn't be bound by earlier limits on its bond buys.

While Italy continues to be the epicenter of the pandemic fight on the Continent, with 80,589 confirmed cases, infections in Spain have risen 10-fold during its national lockdown, to 57,786. The country's death toll from the respiratory illness surpassed China's on Wednesday and now stands at 4,365. Only Italy has a higher toll, with 8,215 fatalities.

More than 24,000 people have died world-wide after contracting the virus, according to Johns Hopkins data.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Crisis Widens Rift Between U.S. and China --- Finger-pointing makes a joint effort to fight outbreak doubtful, unlike 2008 downturn

Chinese President Xi Jinping has been on a telephone spree this month, dialing the leaders of coronavirus-battered France, Italy, Spain and Germany with offers of support, including masks and other medical equipment. One phone number he hasn't tried is President Trump's.

The last time the leaders of the world's two largest economies talked was in early February when the virus was ravaging China but not the U.S. The two talked about whether China would still buy as many farm goods as it promised in a trade deal.

Since then, both governments have traded barbs over the coronavirus, generating distrust that now stands in the way of rescuing the global economy.

""How do you cooperate when you hear the president of the United States referring to the epidemic as the 'Chinese virus' all day long,"" said a Beijing government adviser. A senior U.S. administration official countered that China's attempts to cast suspicion that the virus originated in the U.S. ""are dangerous, counterproductive to relief efforts and something we're watching closely.""

On Thursday, Messrs. Trump and Xi participated in a videoconference of leaders of the Group of 20 large economies, whose members pledged to spendmore than $5 trillion to help the global economy. While China and the U.S. supported that goal, the two leaders didn't address each other directly, people familiar with the meeting said. Mr. Trump later said he would talk with Mr. Xi on Thursday night.

As the global economy lurches toward recession, the world's two largest economies are taking potshots at each other and ignoring chances for coordination. A relationship that helped pull the world out of a global recession a decade ago now is on the rocks.

Relations between the two giants have been frayed by two years of conflict over trade, accusations of technology theft and China's more assertive push for global influence. The trade war paused in January with a deal that left in place U.S. tariffs on about two-thirds of Chinese imports into the U.S. Any boost in goodwill was short-lived.

""All the truculence is very unhelpful with respect to the areas of cooperation that could be there,"" said Lawrence Summers, a top economic policy official in the Obama White House during the financial crisis. He ticked off ways the two sides could be working better together, from developing vaccines to keeping supply chains operating.

During the latest global downturn in 2008 and 2009, the two nations worked in lockstep to stimulate demand through massive spending programs. They lobbied G-20 nations to do the same. The U.S. also persuaded China to hold on to its trillion-dollar cache of U.S. government securities, despite Chinese concern that their investments would tank.

President George W. Bush called Chinese leader Hu Jintao twice within a month of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 that fueled a financial crisis that quickly spread globally. Mr. Bush's message to Mr. Hu was, recalls a senior Chinese official, ""come join me, and help me save the global economy.""

Some discussion about the recently concluded trade deal and other issues is taking place, though it is being handled at the subcabinet level, with Undersecretary of Treasury Brent McIntosh talking with Finance Vice Minister Liao Min.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has consulted with People's Bank of China Governor Yi Gang, officials in both countries say. But the two central banks can't act in concert -- and couldn't during the global financial crisis -- because the People's Bank isn't an independent agency. For its most important decisions, it needs the approval of the Chinese leadership. China so far has resisted joining the Fed and other Western central banks in aggressively slashing interest rates to help stimulate the economy.

U.S. officials say the economic problems unleashed by the coronavirus mainly require a domestic response, not one with a starring role for China. That includes helping tide over workers and companies until the pandemic fades, though the G-20 effort also foresees significantly boosting global demand.

Working closely with China could help the global economy recover faster, some economists say. ""If you have a coordinated stimulus, everyone can maintain an open trading system,"" said Brookings Institution economist David Dollar, a former Treasury representative in Beijing. ""Some of the U.S. stimulus will spill over to China and some of China's stimulus will spill over to the U.S.""

What China can or would be willing to do is far from clear. China is trying to restart its economy after the near standstill used to stifle the coronavirus. Beijing wants to do so without aggravatingan already burdensome debt load -- a hangover from its 2009 stimulus spending.

So far, the U.S. has worked internationally mainly through the Group of Seven industrialized democracies -- the U.S., Canada, Germany, Italy, France, Japan and Britain -- which the U.S. chairs this year.

On Tuesday, G-7 finance ministers and central bankers conferred and released a statement stressing their commitment to do ""whatever is necessary"" to restore confidence and ultimately revive economic growth. The G-20 statement on Thursday largely repeated that pledge.

A separate meeting of G-7 foreign ministers ended without a joint statement, because members refused to go along with a U.S. request to refer to the novel coronavirus as the ""Wuhan virus,"" according to an official familiar with the matter.

The response to the global financial crisis represented a high-water mark in economic relations between the U.S. and China, as the two nations spent massively to pull the world out of recession. But the recovery also put in motion forces that would eventually fracture the relationship.

As a presidential candidate, Mr. Trump capitalized on the growing disillusionment with China. As president, he battled with China for two years over trade by assessing heavy tariffs -- prompting Beijing to retaliate in kind -- and by trying to block China telecom giant Huawei Technologies Co. from selling overseas, asserting that the firm is used by Beijing to spy. Huawei denies that charge.

By March, relations had fallen so precipitously, that the two nations couldn't work out the details of a planned shipment of U.S. medical supplies and other aid to China. Beijing finally told the U.S. to send the supplies someplace else. They wound up going elsewhere in the region.

U.S. Cases, Jobless Claims Soar --- Historic run of growth abruptly comes to a close as unemployment filings surge to record

WASHINGTON -- A record 3.28 million workers applied for unemployment benefits last week as the new coronavirus hit the U.S. economy, marking an abrupt end to the nation's historic, decadelong run of job growth.

The number of Americans filing for claims was nearly five times the previous record. The surge was for the week ended March 21 and could rise. Pennsylvania, Ohio and California were among 10 states reporting more than 100,000 claims, leaving unemployment systems overloaded.

Millions of U.S. businesses have announced layoffs or furloughs, as their cash flows dry up. Several state and local authorities have ordered nonessential businesses to close in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic, bringing the great American job machine to a sudden halt.

Until March, U.S. employers added jobs for a record 113 straight months, causing payrolls to grow by 22 million. In the process, millions of people -- including low-wage hourly laborers, disabled people, minorities, former inmates and others -- found work. The unemployment rate, which was 3.5% in February, had been at levels not seen since the 1960s. Wages started to accelerate in the past two years after lagging during the early stages of the expansion that followed the 2007-09 recession.

The strong labor market kept the U.S. economy humming for a decade.

And then, in a matter of days, it stopped.

Millions of Americans, already fearful the new coronavirus could infect them or their families, now have two new worries: When will the job machine start again? And can they hold out until it does? Much will depend on how long the virus crisis lasts and whether federal and state unemployment insurance programs can adapt quickly to fill the immense gaps building in household cash flows until the virus recedes.

""We haven't seen this big of a free fall before,"" said Keith Hall, former director of the Congressional Budget Office and adviser to President George W. Bush. ""Not even during the Depression . . . It's really like an instant Great Recession.""

Mr. Hall said the jobless rate in the coming months could approach the 20% that some economists estimate occurred during the Depression. Northern Trust Chief Economist Carl Tannenbaum said if half the workers in hard-hit industries, such as restaurants, retail and personal services, are laid off, the unemployment rate could rise 10 percentage points, to more than 13%. That is well above the post-World War II record of 10.8% at the end of the 1981-82 recession.

The number of jobless claims filed last week in Pennsylvania increased by 363,469 to 378,908, with 5.8% of the labor force seeking assistance.

Those figures didn't capture everyone seeking assistance. Denzel Buie said he was stymied by crashing websites and unending phone-call waits when attempting to file a claim. The 25-year-old was laid off from his union construction job on March 20. At the start of last week, the state ordered restaurants and bars to shut down.

The increase in claims last week was 17 times higher than the previous record one-week jump. In recessions, claims gradually rise, allowing states to shift resources. Now, more claims were filed last week than for all of April 2009, the peak month for job loss during the 2007-09 recession.

Mr. Buie said his layoff was a serious blow to his family, which includes a 3-year-old daughter. His wife, a secretary, was laid off a week earlier when the allergist's office where she worked suspended operations.

""It's not like I can go get another job,"" Mr. Buie said. ""It was a massive layoff -- the entire construction industry in Philadelphia shut down. All I can do is stay home and pray I don't get sick, because if I go to the hospital, that's another bill.""

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine mandated bars and restaurants to close dine-in services on March 15. The state had 187,784 new jobless claims last week.

Pennsylvania and Ohio provided an estimated number of claims, the only two states to do so, according to the Labor Department. A department analyst said the estimates were likely due to the high-volume of claims received.

Job losses swept across the nation hitting states with varying mandates for social distancing. California, with tough restrictions, had 186,809; Texas, with less, had 155,657; while New Jersey had 155,454.

The claims data likely don't fully capture the severity of the layoffs. Workers aren't required to file for claims the week they are let go. If a person is ill or busy caring for children or family members, they may put off filing, especially if the process requires a lengthy wait.

In addition, more companies laid off workers this week, as additional states ordered nonessential businesses to close.

Economists are divided on whether the downturn is a short-term disruption or the start of a prolonged recession.

If the nation can get back to business quickly, restaurants, airlines, hotels, and others might quickly hire back the workers they have let go or furloughed. With support from government programs, including the $2 trillion rescue program being considered in Congress, the jobless rate could theoretically surge and then recede.

But there are other scenarios. If infection and death rates associated with the coronavirus grow untamed, social distancing could prolong the economic pain. Even if the federal government moves away from its push for social distancing -- as President Trump has suggested he is considering -- states, cities, businesses and individuals could still decide they have no other choice.

The cash crunch now hitting businesses and households also could induce them to pull back further, starting a downward cycle that feeds on itself. All of that could dent business and household confidence, leaving long-lasting economic scars.

Getting back to work thus hangs on how quickly the virus itself is tamed.

Large corporations were initially reluctant to lay off workers aggressively, in part because they expected the virus to pass quickly and didn't want to part with employees.

Now, pressures to fire people are building beyond the industries most directly exposed. General Electric Co.'s jet-engine business said Monday it would lay off about 10% of its U.S. workforce, or about 2,500 employees. Medical offices not tied to treating the virus, including dentists and physical therapists, are shutting and letting workers go. Those providing in-person services -- such as barbers, massage therapists and housecleaners -- are seeing business evaporate.

The job market isn't uniformly dark, in part because the repercussions of the crisis are spreading unevenly. Walmart Inc., Amazon.com Inc., and CVS Health Corp. are among about a dozen large companies that have said they are seeking to hire nearly 500,000 workers in coming weeks. The companies are managing a surge in demand for food and other household products that have taxed their stores and warehouses.

Though those mini-booms are encouraging, economists don't expect them to fully counter the pressures millions of other employers face to lay off workers as sales and cash flows dry up.

Mr. Hall, the former CBO director, is among the economists who expect the economy to recover at a slower pace than it contracts. But he pointed to a reason for hope: The labor market has defied expectations in the recent past, drawing a larger share of Americans into the workforce than many expected and reaching low unemployment levels few thought possible.

World News: Maduro Faces Drug Charges in The U.S.

U.S. authorities charged Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and senior government officials with drug trafficking and conspiring with terrorists, and offered multimillion-dollar rewards for their arrests, escalating the Trump administration's effort to unseat the leftist regime.

Prosecutors unsealed a series of criminal cases in New York, Florida and Washington on Thursday targeting much of Venezuela's current leadership, including Diosdado Cabello, the head of the country's Constituent Assembly, a rubber-stamp body set up by Mr. Maduro after losing the National Assembly to the opposition majority; defense minister, Vladimir Padrino; and the chief justice of the Supreme Court.

In a superseding indictment filed in New York that is the product of a decadelong investigation, prosecutors accused Mr. Maduro, his deceased predecessor Hugo Chavez and other leaders in their governments of coordinating with a military-linked drug cartel and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, which the U.S. has labeled as a terrorist guerrilla group.

In associated action, the State Department offered a total of $60 million for the arrest and capture of several of the people charged: $15 million for Mr. Maduro, $10 million for each of four other top current and former officials, and $5 million for a senior FARC member.

Under Venezuela's leadership, the U.S. said, Caracas ""prioritized using cocaine as a weapon against America"" by flooding the U.S. with tons of the drug during the past two decades, starting when Mr. Chavez became president.

In a televised speech, Mr. Maduro blasted the indictments. ""This is an extravagantly extremist, vulgar, and miserable act,"" said Mr. Maduro in a television broadcast Thursday night. ""A collection of dirty, false accusations -- and as if they were cowboys from the Old West, they put a price on the head of revolutionaries who are ready to combat them everywhere and keep on beating them. You are a miserable person, Donald Trump.""

Mr. Maduro is unlikely to ever be in U.S. custody to face the charges, but U.S. officials say that detailing the regime's activities could undermine his political support both at home and abroad.

Messrs. Maduro, Cabello and Hugo Carvajal, a former head of military intelligence, eventually ran the Venezuelan military-linked drug cartel known as Cartel de los Soles, using cocaine provided by FARC in exchange for military-grade machine guns, rocket launchers and training, prosecutors said.

Mr. Maduro's regime helped the FARC move drugs amounting to some 250 tons a year, including via a Caribbean sea route, the indictment said.

Most FARC members disarmed and formed a political party as part of a 2016 peace deal, though some rejected the pact and operate from Venezuela, say U.S. and Colombian officials. The leaders of the now-defunct group say they taxed cocaine traffickers to fund their war but never trafficked cocaine.

""The Maduro regime is awash in corruption and criminality,"" Attorney General William Barr said. ""While the Venezuelan people suffer, this cabal lines their pockets with drug money and the proceeds of their corruption.""

Cliver Alcala, a former general indicted alongside Mr. Maduro, denied the charges.

A White House representative couldn't be reached for comment.

U.S. News: New Law Would Steady, Not Restore, Economy

WASHINGTON -- The $2 trillion emergency relief package approved by the Senate would help stabilize the coronavirus-battered economy -- but likely isn't enough to bring it back to health.

Preliminary data suggest that the U.S. economy is already shrinking, as businesses close and unemployment soars. The depth of the economic decline in the coming months will depend on how quickly Washington can deliver checks to cash-strapped households and businesses, as well as whether a treatment is found and how soon shutdowns are lifted, economists said.

If passed, the new law would provide loans and other disbursements to a wide swath of the economy, including direct payments to Americans and loans to large and small companies. Rep. Steny Hoyer (D., Md.), the House majority leader, said late Wednesday that the House would consider the stimulus bill on Friday. President Trump has said he would sign it immediately.

""As big as this is, you'll never look back on this and say, 'We went too big.' You'll look back and say, 'What did we miss?'"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.

At more than 9% of gross domestic product, the measure is larger than the three major packages enacted to counter the 2007-09 recession, said Ernie Tedeschi, an economist at Evercore ISI. Even so, more will be needed, he said.

""The scale of the problem is accelerating, and it's moving faster than fiscal policy makers are acting,"" Mr. Tedeschi said.

Economists at Moody's Analytics predict the bill would limit the drop in second-quarter GDP to 17% at an annual rate. Without the legislation, it would have fallen at a nearly 30% rate, they estimate. For the year as a whole, Moody's expects output to decline by 2%.

The measure provides for one-time payments of $1,200 each to many Americans, plus $500 per child, with assistance limited to certain income levels. It expands unemployment insurance and includes $349 billion in loans to small businesses to help them pay workers and cover expenses.

Another $500 billion would be available to the Treasury Department to make or guarantee loans to larger corporations, including airlines, either directly or through lending facilities established by the Federal Reserve.

""All of these different measures are meant to plug the holes in the boat, if you will, as opposed to trying to speed things up,"" said Wells Fargo economist Michael Pugliese.

Plugging the boat will take time. Trump administration officials said they hope to begin making the first paymentsto households within a few weeks. During the last downturn, it took more than two months.

""A lot of families and businesses can know that help is on the way,"" said Jason Furman, a Harvard University economics professor and former chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers. ""Hopefully they can hang on until the help gets there, but the help is not going to come overnight.""

Payments to households, estimated to total $300 billion, would likely come in waves, first to people whose information the government already has, such as federal benefit recipients and people who file regular tax returns. Harder to reach may be the most vulnerable: people who don't file taxes because their income is too low.

The payments might be delayed by the burden they place on an underfunded Internal Revenue Service, with a workforce strained by the pandemic and unable to staff taxpayer assistance centers.

Potentially one of the most helpful pieces of the bill, economists said, is a broad expansion in unemployment insurance. The measure would extend benefits to gig economy workers and freelancers and would increase current unemployment assistance by $600 a week for four months.

A new program launched under the Small Business Administration would also take time to distribute $350 billion in loans to companies with fewer than 500 employees. Employers that keep paying workers through the downturn could have the loans forgiven.

Once the program is established, the SBA would then have to assess the eligibility of borrowers. Firms would need to prove the size of their workforce and their previous payroll expenses to determine loan sizes.

Policy makers will probably revisit the programs later in the year to determine whether they have done enough.

World News: Iraq Militants Try Stealth Tactics

The Iran-backed groups trying to drive U.S. troops out of Iraq have moved to a more clandestine approach that further complicates the Trump administration's response to attacks against American forces.

Marking a shift in a campaign the U.S. has blamed on established Iran-backed militias, an unknown group calling itself the League of Revolutionaries claimed responsibility for the most recent deadly attack, when rockets fired at an Iraqi base on March 11 killed two American troops and a British soldier.

""The incentive now is to create new groups that can carry out the dirty work,"" said Ramzy Mardini, a scholar at the U.S. Institute of Peace, a Congress-funded think tank in Washington. ""You can't do coercion effectively if the U.S. can locate you and retaliate.""

As tensions have escalated between the U.S. and Iran, Iraq has emerged as the primary battleground, with more than two dozen rocket attacks targeting American troops in the past six months.

Hostilities in Iraq between the U.S. and Iran intensified in January, after the U.S. killed Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani and Iran responded with a barrage of ballistic missiles fired at two bases housing U.S. troops.

""Having -- very unusually for [the Iranians] -- conducted an attack they took credit for, they now intend to move back into the gray zone and do things [for which] they believe they have plausible deniability,"" a U.S. official said after the ballistic-missile attack.

A series of retaliatory strikes by the U.S. has failed to deter militant assaults, which Washington blames on Iraqi Shiite militias and their patron, Iran. Tehran denies involvement, as does Kataib Hezbollah, the militia the U.S. has singled out and targeted with airstrikes.

Facing increased threats, the U.S. has begun moving troops to larger bases that can be more easily protected. The hostile environment in Iraq has undermined the fight against Islamic State, as U.S. forces devote greater attention to protecting themselves.

Iranian officials and their allies in Iraq have said their ultimate goal is for U.S. troops to leave the country. The latest intensification of rocket attacks came as efforts to force American troops out through political channels lost steam.

By forming new groups, militants can attack U.S. troops while denying the involvement of established groups such as Kataib Hezbollah, which has vowed revenge for the killing of Gen. Soleimani and an Iraqi commander, who together oversaw militia groups in Iraq.

For the U.S., ""it muddies the water in how to respond,"" said Mr. Mardini.

The logo of the League of Revolutionaries incorporates elements of other Iran-backed militias. A senior military official with the U.S.-led coalition said the group appeared to be ""the same old actors organizing themselves differently.""

Some Iraqi officials cast doubt on whether the organization exists, describing the video announcing its emergence as amateurish and noting that it offered no evidence it had conducted an attack.

Unlike previous attacks by Iraqi militias, one of those claimed by the new group was conducted in daylight and used a fixed -- instead of a mobile -- rocket launcher. The launcher was similar to those used by other Iran-backed forces, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen, said Fabian Hinz, an arms researcher at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, Calif.

The formation of a new militant group is a tactic that was used by Iran and its allies against Americans to evade reprisals in the years following the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. The revival of the strategy appears aimed at deflecting blame from the established militias that became a formal part of the country's security apparatus after the war against Islamic State, analysts and officials said.

Plans to form a new group appeared to predate the U.S. killing of the Iranian commander, Gen. Soleimani, an Iraqi official said, with the intention of dialing up pressure on the U.S. ahead of the presidential election in November.

""It is aimed at putting more pressure on the Americans to possibly assess that Iraq is not worth staying in,"" the official said.

The U.S. has begun resizing its footprint in Iraq. This month, it withdrew forces from the al-Qaim outpost on the border with Syria and said it planned to pull out of others in the coming months.

Heard on the Street
China Is Looking Like a Haven --- Beijing slowed spread of virus and started stimulus but economic damage is uncertain and secondary outbreak can't be ruled out

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

Western politicians spent January and February excoriating Beijing for its disastrous early attempts to suppress public discussion of the coronavirus. Now Europeans and Americans are paying for their own politicians' refusal to acknowledge the threat, while China's epidemic ebbs and its economy slowly recovers. Should investors lucky enough to have cash be looking at China?

Consider the scoreboard. The U.S. has already cut benchmark lending rates to near zero and 10-year Treasurys yield less than 1%, but the nation's economy remains in free fall. A $2 trillion fiscal stimulus looks close to becoming law -- after precious days lost haggling in Congress -- but more than three million have already lost their jobs. China, meanwhile, has already begun executing a substantial fiscal stimulus, has ample space to push down interest rates, has successfully slowed the spread of the virus -- and its economy is bouncing back, albeit slowly. Which market would you rather be in?

But there are big caveats to this argument. It still isn't clear how deep the damage to Chinese firms from the recent shutdowns really runs, and a secondary outbreak can't be ruled out. Add all this together and bonds -- specifically those issued by the government -- look like a better bet than stocks.

The argument for Chinese government bonds is straightforward. The 10-year variety now yields nearly 2% more than U.S. equivalents. Beijing -- unlike Washington -- still has plenty of scope to push rates lower, and it will need to do so over the coming months to insulate the economy from falling demand abroad. Inflation is likely to cool as farms and domestic transport links revive.

Meanwhile, thanks in part to Beijing's aggressive fiscal response -- including postponing social insurance payments for small businesses -- worst-case scenarios for unemployment and business failures have likely been avoided.

Notably, household optimism seems to be rebounding. In a late February and early March survey of Chinese consumers in 56 cities, more than 80% expected their incomes to increase or stay the same over the coming year, according to Matthews Asia -- up around 10 percentage points from January levels, although still well below December's figure.

More than 80% of migrant workers have now returned from the countryside and other high-frequency measures of economic activity such as coal consumption have also rebounded to around 80% of pre-Lunar New Year levels, according to Morgan Stanley.

Rebounding economic activity doesn't necessarily make stocks a buy, however. March monthly data -- backward looking as it is -- will likely be horrendous. That could shock stocks lower again.

Whether China can really avoid that is the big unknown. After initial missteps, China has had more luck containing the spread of Covid-19 than the U.S. and Europe. The nation's strict censorship was a big disadvantage in preventing the outbreak to begin with, but its authoritarian political structure and infatuation with big-data surveillance also give it tools the West lacks now. China is also far and away the largest producer of medical masks.

The similar success of Northeast Asian neighbors Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, which have very different political systems, suggests cultural factors are at play as well. The traumatic memories of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak run deep throughout China's periphery. Social distancing and strict preventive hygiene measures sprang up almost immediately after the coronavirus surfaced, due to both government decrees and social pressure. Governments made test approvals, rigorous contact tracing, and mandatory quarantines top priorities.

As Western economies continue to suffer, Chinese government bonds could reward investors. But Chinese stocks remain too risky a bet.

REVIEW --- After the Pandemic: Local Leaders Showing The Way Forward

As governor of Florida, I dealt with the aftermath of 9/11, major floods and fires, and an anthrax attack, as well as eight hurricanes and four tropical storms over just 16 months. Each crisis, however difficult, was a learning opportunity. Each made our state and local emergency responders better at their jobs and improved Florida's capacity to deal with future problems.

The coronavirus pandemic is an unprecedented crisis, challenging all of us to protect our families' health and survive the severe economic consequences of self-quarantining. The risks are real, and the path forward is uncertain. But we will get through this, and the experience is likely to bring about significant changes in our society.

First, dealing with the coronavirus will help to restore respect for leadership and expertise. Glued to our television sets, we see mayors, governors and public-health professionals making tough decisions and exuding competence. No ""the-dog-ate-my-homework"" and ""it's-not-my-fault"" excuses -- just old-school, inspired leadership.

Once the trauma passes, I feel sure that more Americans will appreciate leadership based on evidence, problem-solving and consensus-building. They will see the importance of skill, professionalism and science-based solutions. Support for these values could go a long way toward reducing the hyperpartisanship that now paralyzes Washington.

Second, for most of our history, America has been a bottom-up country, relying less on the federal government than on what Edmund Burke called the ""little platoons"" and on governments closer to the people they serve. Over the past generation, we have seen the federal government encroach ever more. The federal government's inability to respond quickly and effectively to the coronavirus is creating a newfound respect for local initiatives, private-sector creativity, personal responsibility and civic engagement. Let us hope that Washington loosens its grip on policy and allows federalism to bloom.

Finally, we need to use today's crisis as a learning opportunity. Millions of Americans are asking: Why does it take so long for a vaccine to become available? How did the U.S. become dependent on Chinese manufacturing for vital pharmaceutical ingredients? How can China build a hospital in weeks while we seem paralyzed? Why do licensing laws restrict health-care providers from providing care? Where on Earth are the ventilators? The list is long and varied.

The explanation for many of these problems is that outdated 20th-century rules stymie 21st-century innovation. In an emergency, many of those rules can be waived by executive order. After the crisis, there will be momentum to challenge the stale rules that hindered our response. This is likely to go well beyond dealing with pandemics.

Telehealth, for instance, should become more commonplace, both because of the shortage of health-care professionals and because of the help it provides in delivering care efficiently. And as millions of American families are discovering, online instruction is a viable means for students to learn. States will need to figure out how to change licensing and payment rules to encourage these revolutions in vital services.

During and after this crisis, across the policy spectrum, in both the public and private sectors, people will ask, ""If we weren't doing it this way, how would we do it?"" By making this question our post-pandemic mantra, we will become more nimble and innovative, less reliant on Washington and more focused on the long-term issues that will drive America toward a more purposeful and prosperous future.

U.S. News: Police Practices Are Changing As Pandemic Grips the Country

Law and order is changing across America during the novel coronavirus pandemic, as police pull back on arrests for small-time crimes and focus on breaking up gatherings that pose health risks, while coping with the perils of a job that can't be done with social distancing.

In Houston, three officers have tested positive for the coronavirus after apprehending a mentally ill man on the street last week who had flu-like symptoms.

""You can't exercise social distancing when you're taking police action,"" said Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo. ""It's part of the risk we take.""

In New York City, 236 police employees have tested positive, and 8.9% of the New York Police Department's uniformed officers called in sick Wednesday, more than three times as high as a normal day.

Large agencies such as New York's can use overtime and staggered shifts to cover for sick or quarantined officers, but most of the nation's 18,000 police departments can't.

""If you've got a department of 50 officers and you get 10 of them that get it, that's really a difficult issue,"" said Tom Manger, retired police chief of Montgomery County, Md. ""On the flip side, most departments are seeing many fewer calls for service and the crime rates are really plummeting because no one's out.""

So far, crime has fallen on the empty streets of most big U.S. cities, including San Francisco, the first major city to order residents to stay at home. Serious crimes in New York City were down last week compared with a year ago, except for a 50% increase in car thefts. In Chicago, both violent and property crime are slightly below normal levels. In Dallas, violent and property crimes fell last week compared with the previous week.

Law-enforcement officials are paying close attention to the ripple effects of paring back law-enforcement, mass layoffs and lockdown orders. With more people at home, police expect domestic violence to rise. With many shops closed, burglaries and thefts could increase, too.

To help slow the spread of the virus, police chiefs are directing their officers not to arrest people for minor offenses and instead cite and release them. In Philadelphia, police are delaying arrests for nonviolent crimes such as drug offenses and prostitution. In Los Angeles, where eight officers have tested positive, petty criminals aren't being jailed in some cases.

""We are encouraging citing and releasing individuals for low-level nonviolent offenses and that is so we limit everybody's exposure,"" said Josh Rubenstein, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department.

Dallas police will no longer show up in person to take reports for car break-ins, graffiti and other minor offenses. Residents must file reports online. Two officers there have tested positive.

In Chicago, arrests during the past week were down 46%, and traffic stops and investigatory stops were down 60% compared with a year ago.

In Dallas, there have been 45% fewer arrests to date in March compared with the March 2019 period. New York City had a 42% drop last week when compared the same week last year. In Los Angeles County, arrests dropped from around 300 a day in normal timesto about 60.

In cities and states where residents have been ordered to stay at home, and nonessential businesses have been ordered to close, officers are shifting their time and energy to policing a new social order.

Officers in New York City are patrolling parks to enforce social distancing, visiting restaurants and bars to make sure they are closed, and checking supermarkets and public spaces to make sure crowds are sparse.

In Warrenton, Mo., police arrested 26-year-old Cody Pfister for making a terrorist threat after he posted a widely shared video of himself licking items at a Walmart and saying, ""Who's scared of coronavirus?""

His lawyer, Patrick Coyne, said the situation is far different than when the video was made on March 10. ""Everything has changed at warp speed, but that should not work retroactively and convert a tasteless and impulsive act into a criminal terrorist threat,"" he said.

Like many on the front lines of the pandemic, police are struggling with short supplies of face masks. They also are scrambling to sanitize squad cars that are occupied by a variety of officers and suspects.

Officers on dangerous assignments are faced with decisions about whether to wear protective gear or not. Frederick Frazier, a Dallas police detective, said he chose not to wear gloves last week when a fugitive task force he is part of searched for violent offenders.""We're not used to those gloves with our weapons,"" he said.

But some of the fugitives were taking no chances, he said. As they closed in to arrest an alleged marijuana dealer in East Dallas who was wanted for pointing a gun at a police officer, Det. Frazier could see that the suspect was wearing bright blue surgical gloves as he plied his trade. ""Man, I don't want to catch corona!"" the man said, according to Det. Frazier.

REVIEW --- After the Pandemic: Never Taking Travel For Granted Again --- Crossing the globe had never been easier, until the coronavirus reminded us of the real meaning of distance.

Travel had become so easy. In the time before Covid-19, and especially in the last decade, it was as if the map of the Earth had folded upon itself, bringing the furthest corners close together. Borders had thinned to veils, barely there. Once you got where you were going, you hardly felt displaced. You could call home and check your email easily, pull cash from the maw of obliging ATMs anywhere in the world.

Now that we're locked in our houses, travel like this seems so long ago. In fact, travel feels especially implicated in the current crisis, since the mobility we've enjoyed for the last several decades seems to be instrumental in spreading the disease globally. Before crisscrossing the world became commonplace, illnesses were usually local. Now we've become the carriers that spread it world-wide, bringing it along like baggage on cruise ships and airplanes as we hopscotch around the planet.

The era of easy travel came on gradually. Thirty years ago, when I started to travel for my reporting, I readied myself like a soldier. I bought travelers' checks, refilled my prescriptions, did the necessary battery of vaccinations and tetanus boosters, paid any upcoming bills and said purposeful goodbyes, because unless there was an emergency, there would be no connection to home. When things went well, travel back then was immersive in a way it would never be again. Everything familiar was blotted out, allowing you to experience the newness of the place.

But when things went badly, it could be really scary. In 1998, I went to Bhutan to visit a friend. My flight was diverted to Kolkata because the airport in Bhutan was closed; we didn't have visas to enter the country, so we were stripped of our passports, deposited in an airport hotel and ordered to stay in our rooms until we were summoned back to the airport. I didn't have a cellphone (they were rare and expensive at that time). There was no internet. For the first time in my life, no one had any idea of where I was. I don't present this as an ideal travel scenario -- it was upsetting and harrowing -- but it made me realize how profound leaving home really is and what it really means to be away from the familiar.

Since then, the world has become much more fluid, and the convenience of traversing the globe has slightly dulled the dazzle of the experience. Travel is a little less astonishing when, for instance, you can be on a game trail in South Africa and get a text from your son's school saying his lunch order for next month is due. But is convenience why we travel? Isn't part of the purpose to step out of our ordinary lives?

Now no one is traveling, even to the corner cafe, because of the coronavirus pandemic. In the modern era, humankind has probably never been as housebound as it is right now. When the restrictions ease, we will certainly start traveling again. The impulse to explore the world is so powerful that it will roar back in time. We won't shed the handy things that have made travel so much more comfortable than it was in the past, but we will have gone through a reckoning. That folded map of the world has been ironed out a bit by this pandemic. Things feel distant again, literally unreachable, and we might never again take accessibility so much for granted. We may find ourselves once more awed by the very notion that we can go from here to there, from our own worlds into others, and savor it more fully, as something nearly lost can be treasured anew.

The State Department offered a total of $60 million for the arrest and capture of several people charged with drug trafficking and conspiring with terrorists: $15 million for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, $10 million for each of four other top current and former officials, and $5 million for a senior member of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. In some editions Friday, a World News article about the charges incorrectly said the State Department offered a total of $65 million for the arrest and capture of Mr. Maduro and four current and former officials.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: OECD Warns on Growth Outlook

WASHINGTON -- Measures taken to curb the spread of the new coronavirus could lower economic activity in the U.S. and other developed countries by a quarter, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Friday.

In a report made available to leaders of the Group of 20 leading economies for a video conference they held Thursday, OECD economists estimated the likely impact on the sectors most affected by widespread business closures and orders for people to remain at home, and the size of those sectors in each national economy.

The OECD calculated that the activities most directly affected by the shutdowns -- ranging from restaurants to automobile makers -- account for between 30% and 40% of total output in most of the developed economies. With activity in many of those sectors curtailed, it calculated that output was likely to be between 20% and 25% lower than is usual in large, developed economies.

If the measures are sustained for three months, the OECD forecast total annual output would be 6% lower in the developed economies. Under this scenario for the U.S., where the economy was forecast to grow 2% this year before the virus struck, the OECD estimates output would fall 4% in 2020.

""Our analysis further underpins the need for sharper action to absorb the shock, and a more coordinated response by governments to maintain a lifeline to people and a private sector that will emerge in a very fragile state when the health crisis is past,"" OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurria said in the report.

Signs already point to a deterioration in U.S. economic conditions during March, as the number of infections and deaths related to the virus climbed and multiple government authorities ordered nonessential businesses to close and urged people to stay home. A record 3.28 million U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits just last week, and forecasters now expect the unemployment rate to rise steeply.

The declines in other large economies would be similar to that in the U.S, according to the OECD. The organization's economists estimated that output losses would likely be greatest in Greece, which has a large tourism industry, and least in Ireland, which relies heavily on digital businesses.

Meanwhile in Italy, businesses and consumers became much more gloomy about their prospects this month, as the death toll from the coronavirus continued to climb and an already extensive lockdown tightened further.

Istat, the official Italian statistics agency, said Friday its measure of consumer confidence slumped to 101.0 from 110.9 in February as Italians saw a significant worsening of the economic outlook, while its measure of business confidence plummeted to 81.7 from 97.8. The turn to pessimism among companies was most marked among service providers, many of which have been almost entirely deprived of customers by social distancing.

The consumer confidence reading was the lowest since January 2015, while the business confidence measure was the weakest since December 2011.

Consumer sentiment also soured in the U.S. this month, according to a University of Michigan survey released Friday. The survey's index of consumer sentiment fell to 89.1 in March -- its lowest level since 2016 -- down from 101.0 in February.

The index's drop -- the fourth-largest one-month decline in nearly 50 years -- hints at a broad pullback in spending as the virus upends daily life, said Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist.

""The extent of additional declines in April will depend on the success in curtailing the spread of the virus and how quickly households receive funds to relieve their financial hardships,"" he said.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Friday he expects the economy to rebound strongly after the widespread shutdown to contain the coronavirus is lifted, adding that the federal government is working at ""lightning speed"" to provide support.

Asked if he agreed with some investors' view that U.S. economic output could expand by 5% in the fourth quarter, Mr. Mnuchin said, ""Absolutely.""

Consumers just last month were still buoyed by a solid labor market and firming wages, and in turn boosted spending as personal income rose.

Personal-consumption expenditures, or household spending, ticked up by a seasonally adjusted 0.2% from January and personal income was up 0.6%, the Commerce Department reported Friday.

EXCHANGE --- Banks Get a Break on Bad-Loan Accounting

WASHINGTON -- U.S. regulators gave banks a reprieve from new accounting standards that require lenders to book losses on soured loans more quickly, the latest step designed to encourage banks to keep lending during the spread of the new coronavirus.

Banks will now have up to two additional years before they must set aside more capital for reserves against loan losses, as required by the new ""current expected credit loss,"" or CECL, accounting standard, regulators said.

The Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which regulates national banks, also said they would speed up the implementation of a new methodology for measuring counterparty credit risk in derivatives transactions.

That move likely reduces the amount of capital lenders have to hold against such transactions because it recognizes improvements to the safety of the derivatives markets since the financial crisis of 2008.

REVIEW --- After the Pandemic: A Moment to Renew American Statesmanship --- The global challenges ahead demand a return to character, vision and discipline in applying U.S. power.

In the spring of 1919, as the world's major powers descended on Versailles to negotiate peace after World War I, President Woodrow Wilson was in bed with the flu. At a moment when, as Wilson's doctor put it, ""the whole of civilization seemed to be in the balance,"" a horrific influenza pandemic cast a shadow over the prospect of a new order.

A century later, we find ourselves again crippled by a pandemic during another of those rare plastic moments in world affairs -- a perfect storm of major shifts in the balance of power and massive political, economic, technological and environmental transformations. Great-power rivalry is back; China has risen, and America's old dominance has been spent. The world's economic and military center of gravity is shifting from West to East. A technological revolution is upending how we live, work and fight. Tensions are growing between open and closed societies, with nationalism and authoritarianism resurgent and democracy seemingly in reverse. The tailwinds of globalization have transformed into powerful headwinds, even as climate change looms as an existential threat.

The storm has been gathering for some time, and America's post-Cold War missteps quickened the landfall. Today's coronavirus pandemic will further intensify the storm's severity, with terrible human and economic costs. It will be a painful accelerant -- exposing our vulnerabilities and magnifying the challenge of navigating a crowded, complicated and competitive international landscape.

The crisis will reinforce cocky convictions -- from Moscow to Beijing -- about the demise of a ""liberal international order."" It will spur strongmen to grip even tighter, bolstered by new surveillance technologies. Narrow-minded nationalists will fan the flames of xenophobia. Key Western democracies, already infected by paralytic politics and constipated governance, will see their crisis of self-confidence deepen.

Connectivity will be seen as a weakness, not a strength, dealing another blow to the fragile European project. The Middle East and Africa, already burdened by conflicts and pathologies, will be exposed to even more troubles. The U.N. and other international institutions, long groaning and creaking, will start to crack, as will the alliances that have bolstered American security. Global humanitarian crises will worsen, their toll compounded by the virus and an increasingly under-resourced and distracted global response.

But shocks like this awful pandemic can clarify as well as accelerate. With brutal impact, they give us a chance to diagnose our challenges with clear eyes. The test for American statesmanship will be to resist the temptation to pull up the drawbridges and retreat, as well as the illusion that we can restore the easy dominance we once enjoyed.

We cannot resurrect the uniquely commanding positions that helped American statesmen in the administrations led by Harry Truman and George H.W. Bush shape similar plastic moments over the past century. But we can revive their model of character, vision and discipline in applying American power. We can rebuild America's democratic example and rekindle the confidence of our allies and the respect of our rivals. Even in this most difficult of moments, we have a rare opening to recover a sense of national purpose and enlightened self-interest and to help Americans -- and the world -- find shelter from the storm.

Nowhere other than in China is the coronavirus epidemic more severe than in Iran, where authorities confirmed Sunday that at least 54 people, including an 81-year-old former ambassador, have died from Covid-19. The real death toll may be considerably higher than that; on Friday, BBC Persian tallied 210 deaths from individual hospitals. Seven prominent officials have contracted the disease, including Vice President Masoumeh Ebtekar, who in her youth served as a spokesman for U.S. Embassy hostage-takers. Deputy Health Minister Iraj Harirchi broke out in a sweat Feb. 24 as he assured the public that the epidemic was under control; the following day he announced he was sick.

President Hassan Rouhani has lamely insisted the epidemic is ""one of the enemy's plots."" His government, meanwhile, has inspired unprecedented apathy. Turnout in February's parliamentary elections was the lowest in the Islamic republic's history: 43% nationally and 25% in Tehran.

These are symptoms of a broader malaise. The world-wide material and human progress of the past few decades has largely left Iran behind, despite conditions that should encourage success. It sits at the crossroads of Eurasia and has a highly educated population of 85 million. Perhaps the greatest cultural, economic and geopolitical tragedy of our time is the near-absence of the Iranian nation in a world perfectly suited for its human potential.

History often moves on a hinge, and there were many hinges in the late 1970s. Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi suffered from lymphatic cancer: that, and his prednisone regimen, adversely affected his judgment and decisiveness. President Jimmy Carter was prone to vacillating and misread the intentions of the Iranian clerical movement. Iraqi Vice President Saddam Hussein expelled the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini from the Shiite holy city of Najaf, forcing Khomeini into exile in the Paris suburb of Neauphle-le-Chateau. There he sat cross-legged beneath an apple tree, rallied his followers, and methodically seduced the world media.

If these hinges had not worked together as they did, Iran today might look like South Korea -- a vibrant, pulsing economic engine at the forefront of globalization. The Pahlavis might have gradually been reduced from absolute rulers to constitutional monarchs. Instead, Iran went backward politically, while barely crawling forward economically.

In 1977 Iran's economy was 26% larger than Turkey's, 65% larger than South Korea's, and almost 5.5 times the size of Vietnam's -- all countries with somewhat larger populations. In 2017 on the eve of the Trump administration's sanctions, Turkey's economy was nearly 2.5 times the size of Iran's, South Korea's more than seven times, and Vietnam's had gone from less than 20% to 70%, according to Nadereh Chamlou, a former World Bank official. While poverty has declined in Iran, 40% of the population earns less than $10 a day, which the bank classifies as ""near poverty.""

What went wrong? ""Domestic policies to promote entrepreneurship could have helped to capitalize on Iran's young and educated population,"" Ms. Chamlou concludes. ""A foreign policy geared to regional and global integration could have permitted Iran to benefit much more from its unique economic geography.""

Imagine the geopolitical clout a stable Iranian constitutional monarchy would have today. Iran would enjoy strategic cooperation with Israel and stable, nonconfrontational relations with Saudi Arabia and the Sunni Arab world. Iran is economically, culturally and demographically suited to be at the crossroads of Central Asia: Only its relative backwardness and extreme religiosity prevent the secular, vodka-drinking leaders of former Soviet republics from being more attracted to it.

Instead, Iran is a pauperized and lonely nation. Its only allies in the Greater Middle East are the murderous proxy militias it supports and Bashar Assad's regime in Syria. Arab states like Egypt and Saudi Arabia, not Iran, now have de facto security relationships with Israel, though the Persians have had better relations with the Jews for millennia.

At the same time, the clerical regime has worked to obscure the memory of historic Persia, which preceded Islam by more than a thousand years, reducing a rich civilization to a bleak lumpen proletariat. Theocracy has promoted cynicism about religion. Mosque attendance has been down for years. As the French political scientist Olivier Roy puts it, ""the political victory of Islamism is the end of true devotion."" Instead, crowds gather in Shiraz at the tomb of Hafez, the 14th-century poet of wine and romance. Many an Iranian bookshelf holds a volume of his sensuous verse, a quiet symbol of defiance against the Islamic authorities.

In the Islamic Revolution, one bureaucratic power structure -- that of the shah -- quickly gave way to another, that of the clerics. In this and other ways, the Islamic Revolution was far more sophisticated than the formless, leaderless uprisings of the 2011 Arab Spring. But Iran is in the decadent phase of its revolution. Like the Soviet Union under Leonid Brezhnev, the regime seems stable yet is widely seen as illegitimate by the population, and thus is in danger of unraveling -- perhaps with disastrous aftershocks.

The Soviet collapse under Mikhail Gorbachev led to social and economic upheaval, with violent ethnic conflicts on the Russian imperial periphery and the eventual re-establishment of dictatorship under Vladimir Putin. Iran, like late-Soviet Russia, has a deeply corroded political culture. Prompt establishment of constitutional order may be too much to hope for.

A regime collapse could give way to even more tyrannical rule by the Revolutionary Guards, and to uprisings in the Kurdish, Azeri, Turkman and Baluchi peripheries. Apart from the Revolutionary Guards, there would be no pre-existing bureaucratic power structure to replace the clerical one. Civil society has been decimated for decades. It's not clear if any faction would have complete control of Iran's formidable missile arsenal, which may extend to sites in Iraq and Syria.

The Trump administration is trying to bring Iran to its knees, but it needs to focus on what will come afterward. With a declining economy, a raging coronavirus epidemic, and an aged and ailing supreme leader, Iran in the coming years promises to be more interesting -- and more dangerous -- than at any time in recent memory.

Shoppers Adjust to Plastic-Bag Ban

A new ban on single-use plastic bags took effect Sunday in New York City, amid some confusion and grumbling.

Many shoppers dug out colorful canvas and nylon totes that have accumulated at home for years, backpacks and gym bags and dragged them to supermarkets for the first day of shopping under the new law.

But some large stores and small bodegas weren't ready. On Friday, the day a lawsuit was filed challenging the new law, New York state agreed to delay enforcement of the ban on plastic bags until April 1. The suit was brought by an association of bodega owners and a plastic-bag manufacturer.

The plastic-bag ban is statewide; some localities, including New York City, also introduced a 5-cent fee for each paper bag sold, to encourage customers to switch to reusable bags. After the court hearing, a spokesman for the New York state Department of Environmental Conservation said the state had always planned a period of education before issuing summonses.

The department estimates New York state residents use 23 billion plastic bags a year.

Mike Rosenberg, a pediatrician who lives in Riverdale in the Bronx, was armed with shopping bags and ready for the new ban Sunday. But when he arrived at Fairway Market in West Harlem, he found to his surprise that plastic bags were still available at every checkout counter.

Dr. Rosenberg said he was a long supporter of the ban -- in theory. In practice, he hadn't regularly brought reusable bags with him on shopping trips, as his wife did.

""I have been guilty of using plastic,"" he said. ""The ban has been a long time coming. It should have been done a long time ago.""

At Fairway, the manager on duty said the grocery store planned to switch over when it used up its backlog of plastic bags, probably by Monday. He said some other Fairway Markets had already made the switch. Reusable shopping bags were available for purchase.

At a Dominican bodega, Super Value Meat Market, on West 141st Street and Broadway, aluminum racks at the cashier's counter still held thick wads of plastic bags. Pedro Guzman, who runs the grocery, said he was aware of the bodega-industry lawsuit and plans to comply with the government rules within the next few weeks.

He said he remembers life before the proliferation of plastic bags in the 1980s. ""Everyone used paper bags,"" he said. The bodega will offer durable shopping bags for 79 cents and provide them free to regular customers.

Nery Morales arrived at Food Universe Marketplace, on West 138th Street and Broadway, with a prized Hershey's shopping bag that once carried a gift from her son. That bag was in turn filled with other shopping bags.

""We have no more plastic bags,"" said Frank Beras, the manager. ""The people understand.""

Grocery stores and delis can still offer plastic bags for unpackaged produce and prepared foods. But they won't be available at the checkout line, and customers will have to use either paper, reusable bags or totes.

At one liquor store on Broadway, a clerk said that for now the store had only single-bottle size paper bags available for 5 cents each, and customers would have to provide their own shopping bags for larger purchases.

U.S. News --- THE OUTLOOK: Immigration Drives Canada's Growth

Canada largely avoided the doldrums that afflicted other advanced economies last year amid a global slowdown. Immigration is a big reason why.

Economic growth over the long term generally has two sources: an expanding workforce and advances in productivity, or output per hour worked. When more people are employed, they produce more goods and provide more services, earn more and spend more, creating demand for more workers.

Canada owes its relatively solid pace of economic growth in recent years to gains in the labor force rather than productivity, which has stagnated.

Canada's labor force grew 2% last year according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, faster than the U.S. and Japan, the only other two countries for which the organization had data available for 2019. Most of that was fueled by population growth, about 80% of which comes from immigration.

The growing head count, in turn, has supported growth in consumer spending and a rebound in home sales and prices that began during the second half of last year. That helped Canada overcome a sharp slowdown in trade, muted business investment and a cooling global economy last year.

""Without the immigration boom, the Canadian economy would be lost right now,"" said David Rosenberg, chief economist at Toronto-based Rosenberg Research and Associates.

In any one year, economic growth is affected by many factors. The 2019 global slowdown largely resulted from trade tensions and China's loss of momentum. The U.S. Federal Reserve and several other central banks responded with interest-rate cuts or other stimulus measures. The U.S. economy, which grew 2.3% last year, also benefited from the lingering effects of recent tax cuts and government spending increases.

Canada has enjoyed relatively high population growth -- an annual average of around 1% since the early 2000s. It quickened after the Trudeau government bumped up immigration levels in 2016, reaching 1.4% in 2018, the fastest among the Group of Seven advanced economies, according to the World Bank. While full 2019 figures aren't available, recent Canadian government estimates place the annual rate at 1.5% in the year ended in October.

Canada, with a population of 38 million, accepted about 340,000 new permanent residents in 2019, up from 270,000 in 2015. It also issued roughly 810,000 permits to international students and temporary workers in 2019, up from about 470,000 four years earlier.

Economists say that influx helped Canada's economy expand 1.5% in 2019, the second-best pace in the G-7 after the U.S., according to International Monetary Fund estimates. The Trudeau administration's higher level of immigration has provided stimulus that's roughly comparable to an interest-rate cut of between a quarter percentage point and a half point, Bank of Nova Scotia economist Derek Holt said.

By contrast, economic growth was 0.5% in Germany and 1.2% in the euro area as a whole, according to the IMF, where waves of asylum seekers have hardened public attitudes on immigration.

Still, last year marked a loss of momentum amid the global slowdown. From 2010 through 2018, Canada's annual growth in gross domestic productaveraged 2.2%, slightly below the U.S. and above the rest of the G-7, according to the World Bank.

The Bank of Canada has held its benchmark overnight interest rate since October 2018 at 1.75%, the highest among major advanced economies. Many analysts now see a rising likelihood of central bank interest rate cuts this year, including possibly by Canada, due to the coronavirus outbreak's risk to global growth.

The Bank of Canada's next interest-rate announcement is due Wednesday.

One way population growth bolsters Canada's economy is through its housing markets. Home prices are rising again in Toronto and the surrounding area and have stabilized in Vancouver after mortgage rules aimed at limiting risky borrowing weighed on prices and sales in 2018 and early 2019.

""With more people living in the country, demand for housing has naturally increased,"" said TD Bank chief economist Beata Caranci.

Economists say Canada benefits from a system that gives preference to immigrants with the ability to find and keep a job, based on criteria such as education, language skills and whether they have a job offer. About 60% of the immigrants to Canada are selected with this criteria, a figure that also includes those immigrants' immediate family members. The rest come as refugees or to be reunited with family members already in Canada.

Among the recent arrivals in Canada is Albert Cuesta Reig, a Spaniard who came in 2016 to complete a master's degree in business administration at the University of Toronto. After receiving a three-year work visa he launched an app-based travel services business -- something he says wouldn't have been possible in the U.S., where he had studied for a year on an exchange program.

In the U.S., ""they have amazing schools, but then it's hard to stick around and make use of the network you've built there,"" he said.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
The Afghan Withdrawal Deal

President Trump has made clear he wants all American troops out of Afghanistan, and on Saturday the U.S. signed an ""agreement for bringing peace to Afghanistan"" with the Taliban. The coming months will tell if this is a genuine path to peace or political cover for a U.S. exit.

The good news is that this agreement is better than what the U.S. had seemed to accept in September. The Taliban have killed thousands of Americans, and Mr. Trump shouldn't reward them with a Camp David signing ceremony as he first suggested.

The Taliban, or at least their representatives, have agreed to negotiate with the elected Afghan government for the first time. The Taliban want to establish an Islamist emirate and have previously refused to talk to the Kabul government. The Taliban have also promised to reduce their attacks on Afghan civilians and troops, as a week long test leading to Saturday demonstrated is possible.

For the first time the Taliban have also forsworn support for al Qaeda and are promising to prevent Afghanistan from being a safe haven for any group planning attacks against the U.S. This is the reason the U.S. sent troops to the country after 9/11, and the deal makes clear this is the main American priority.

In return, the U.S. is making significant concessions, in particular a 14-month path to the withdrawal of all American forces. The initial reduction to 8,600 troops from some 13,000 shouldn't be a problem. General Austin Miller, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, says this is enough to fulfill the U.S. mission.

The gamble, and it's a big one, is over the drawdown to zero by May 2021, including from all military bases in the country. This is conveniently after the November election, so Mr. Trump needn't worry about a Taliban march on Kabul before then. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also promised on Saturday in Qatar that this will be a ""conditions-based troop withdrawal,"" and that it can cease if the Taliban reneges on its promises.

But the Taliban know how much Mr. Trump wants out, and it could decide to stand down until U.S. forces leave and then resume its siege against the government. A residual U.S. force including air power and special forces would be safer, but the Taliban and Mr. Trump both want the political boast of complete American withdrawal.

It's far from clear that the Taliban negotiators can deliver on their violence reduction promises. The group is led by local and regional commanders who may not take orders from leaders based in Pakistan. The Afghans are releasing 5,000 Taliban fighters from prison as part of the deal, and many of them will return to the fight.

As for talks with the Kabul government, the Taliban will have to abandon their desire to rule by unaccountable Shariah law. Perhaps some power-sharing or regional-control arrangement can be worked out.

But it's hard to see the Taliban agreeing to lay down their arms and join the Afghan security forces. The deal also has no guarantees to protect Afghan women, who have made great strides in education and health care since the U.S. intervention. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani will need a united front that includes political rival Abdullah Abdullah to have a chance at negotiating a decent outcome.

---

Americans are in a sour mood about foreign interventions, and after 18 years in Afghanistan the desire to come home is understandable. But public frustration shouldn't ignore the major U.S. accomplishments.

Our forces have denied terrorists a safe haven and protected the homeland from another large-scale attack. We have killed the al Qaeda leadership, including Osama bin Laden. We have assisted a Kabul government that, while far from perfect, is free and democratic. We have brought basic education to millions of young Afghans who never had it. And we have trained and equipped Afghan security forces to defend themselves. No one should diminish the sacrifices that Americans have made with their lives and long deployments by dismissing these achievements.

""We will not squander what they and you have won through blood, sweat and tears,"" Mr. Pompeo said on Saturday in Doha. No doubt he means it. We hope President Trump does too.

U.S. News: Trump Renews Push for Rate Cut

President Trump said he is counting on the Federal Reserve to shoulder the government's response to economic disruptions caused by the coronavirus, renewing the pressure campaign he has used against the central bank during previous bouts of market uncertainty.

After the stock markets' worst week since the financial crisis, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell signaled in a statement Friday that the central bank is prepared to cut interest rates to cushion the U.S. economy against the effects of a potential public-health emergency and widening global slowdown.

""Good, it's about time,"" Mr. Trump said at a White House press conference Saturday, referring to the statement. He urged the Fed to reduce interest rates. ""We need a Fed that's going to be a leader.""

Mr. Trump said talk of an economic stimulus program from the White House or Congress, such as by cutting taxes for households and individuals, is premature.

""The big thing we are looking for is the Fed to do its job,"" he said. ""I don't think the Democrats are going to approve any tax cuts."" The administration would unveil tax-cut proposals toward the end of this year, he said.

A Fed spokeswoman declined to comment.

Investors had pushed stocks to record highs previously, sloughing off concerns that the coronavirus epidemic in China would drag the global economy into a prolonged slump. That changed last week, as cases spread in South Korea, Iran and Italy, raising the prospect that public-health officials would need to shift from containing the virus to mitigating its effects.

The S&P 500 suffered its fastest-ever 10% decline from an all-time high last week and the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted its worst week since the 2008 global financial crisis. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note and 30-year bond hit record lows, a sign of investors fleeing risky assets for havens and of expectations for lower U.S. growth.

As investors looked for reassurance, Mr. Powell reprised language he used when the central bank adopted an easing bias last June. ""The coronavirus poses evolving risks to economic activity,"" Mr. Powell said. ""We will use our tools and act as appropriate to support the economy.""

Economists and investors now expect the Fed to cut rates at its next scheduled meeting, March 17-18, if not before then. The Fed's benchmark rate has been in a range between 1.5% and 1.75% since October.

Mr. Trump has made the Fed a regular punching bag when the stock market declines or other potential portents of a recession appear.

He called on the Fed to cut rates or criticized its rate policy more than 80 times last year.

Banks Plan Backup Office Sites as Pandemic Prep

U.S. banks are preparing for a worsening coronavirus outbreak by laying plans to move staffers to back-office sites, limiting contact with clients who have been abroad and curbing employee travel.

Morgan Stanley, whose New York City stock-trading floor is the country's busiest, is preparing a backup site in suburban Westchester County. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has nixed all nonessential international trips. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is canceling some conferences and evaluating powering up a parallel trading floor in Greenwich, Conn.

Not since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks have Wall Street banks faced a logistical challenge like the one potentially posed by a coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. Sustained quarantines and widespread business closures would hit credit-card and corporate-lending businesses. Further interest-rate cuts, which the Federal Reserve may use to shore up the economy, would crimp profits.

""If planes are not flying in and out of China, if hotels are not being filled -- which they're not at the moment -- and if the supply chains are being impacted which I suspect they are, there's going to be some impact,"" Visa Inc. Chief Executive Officer Alfred Kelly said last month.

While technology has made it possible for many to work from home, the multiple screens and compliance systems installed on Wall Street trading floors can't be easily replicated on a laptop. And investment banking is still a face-to-face business, drummed up by weeks on the road.

Financial firms have drawn up elaborate contingency plans in recent years that they hope will allow them to keep operating smoothly. Just a few weeks ago, Bank of New York Mellon Corp. ran a drill temporarily shutting down its downtown Manhattan headquarters, an executive said.

Despite the market meltdown, trading floors at many banks remain calm. One salesperson said increased activity meant it was a bit noisier than usual, but nothing compared with the 2010 flash crash or the weeks leading up to the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers.

Banks and brokers have opened backup facilities throughout the world in recent years. Many are required by their regulators to plan and test for various scenarios, said Glenn Schorr, an analyst with Evercore ISI. Significant improvements in computing power and telecommunications networks also have made working remotely a possibility for many more employees.

One key obstacle for firms will be how they contend with rules on recording phone calls and other communications related to specific transactions when traders aren't working from their usual desk, one bank executive said. Industry officials are urging regulators to consider relaxing these surveillance rules in the event that employees are forced to work from home, this executive said.

Officials at the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, an industry trade group, have raised the surveillance issue in discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission, along with other potential challenges Wall Street would face during a wide-scale evacuation of U.S. trading floors.

""We are providing information to them for them to consider,"" said Kenneth Bentsen, Sifma's president and CEO. ""We haven't made a formal request.""

In some ways, the job of girding against pandemic has gotten simpler. The advent of electronic exchanges, trading algorithms and other technological advances on the markets have steadily shrunk the number of employees on trading floors on Wall Street and elsewhere. And many who remain are in roles that can be performed adequately in remote locations.

With the addition of software engineers, compliance staff and other in-demand positions, the securities industry's total New York City workforce rose to 180,300 last year from 165,900 in 2003, according to the New York State Department of Labor. But the number of employees classified by the department as brokers -- or those who serve as intermediaries between buyers and sellers -- has dropped to 53,300 from 73,000 in the same period.

The 12 biggest global investment banks employed 26% fewer equity traders, salespeople and analysts at the end of 2019 than they did in 2010, according to industry-data firm Coalition Ltd. Front-office staff on bond-trading desks have tumbled 42% over the same period, according to Coalition.

That said, the task of limiting health risks is far-reaching. Like other large companies, lenders are limiting employee exposure to countries where the virus has taken hold. Morgan Stanley's upcoming annual Hong Kong summit will be virtual, while Citigroup Inc. and Bank of America Corp. have restricted employee travel to Asia and Italy.

Goldman's private bankers are canceling meetings with clients who have been to virus hot spots, according to clients. Registered attendees of several upcoming Goldman conferences received emails asking them to stay home if they recently visited virus-affected regions.

A sign at the front desk of the bank's downtown Manhattan headquarters asks visitors who have recently returned from mainland China -- or been in contact with someone who has -- to reschedule.

World News: U.S.-Taliban Deal Faced a Host of Hurdles

DOHA -- Until the last moment, organizers feared the smallest misstep might quash the signing of a historic deal between the U.S. and the Taliban, with mistrust and suspicion enduring until ink was on paper.

The deal -- providing for U.S. troops reductions, a Taliban renunciation of terrorism and intra-Afghan talks -- was more than a year in the making, encountering obstacles all the way up until its approval Saturday at a five-star resort in Doha. It still faces a ""rocky and bumpy"" road ahead, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday.

Minutes after Mr. Pompeo arrived in Doha for Saturday's signing, a Taliban video on Twitter showed Taliban representatives who had arrived to witness the signing of the deal engaged in a victory parade. The procession appeared to be marching toward the resort, their tunics and beards billowing in the wind beneath Taliban flags.

Organizers worried that Mr. Pompeo, with his reputed fiery temper, would see the flags -- the symbol of an Islamic emirate not recognized by the U.S. -- and walk out, people familiar with the matter said. The Qatari government hosts were on guard to stop the flags from entering the hotel; moments later, the Taliban procession arrived without them, the people said.

Tension abounded throughout the day. Mr. Pompeo warmly greeted other diplomats, but U.S. officials had made clear the secretary didn't want to be caught on camera with the insurgents, the people familiar with the matter said. Qatari officials were worried that the Taliban might try to approach Mr. Pompeo, and derail the deal in the final minutes of the event, the people said.

Despite finding himself obliged to shake hands with the Taliban's chief negotiator, Sher Muhammad Abbas Stanekzai, Mr. Pompeo sat stoically in the front row and didn't join in applause for remarks made by the Taliban's political office chief, Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar.

When Mr. Pompeo delivered a speech urging the Taliban to ""keep your promises"" in the agreement, the Qataris worried the insurgents might walk out.

Then, as U.S. Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Mullah Baradar signed the deal, Taliban members in the audience shouted ""Allahu akbar!"" or ""God is Great!""

For Mr. Khalilzad and his team, the signing of the agreement will be far from the end of the story. The pact faces major hurdles, including a political crisis over Afghanistan's contested, fraud-marred presidential election and the looming issue of prisoner exchanges, which the U.S.-Taliban agreement stipulates as a last step to the start of talks between the Taliban, the Afghan government, the opposition and other power brokers.

Mr. Ghani said Sunday that the prisoner release was under Afghan, not U.S., control and that it wouldn't take place as a precondition to intra-Afghan talks.

Afghan-born Mr. Khalilzad, who previously served as a presidential envoy for former President George W. Bush and then as ambassador to Afghanistan, was out of government in 2018 when he began to consult with Mr. Pompeo, who was then in charge of the Central Intelligence Agency.

Mr. Khalilzad was invited in August 2018 to discuss the job of U.S. envoy for talks with the Taliban, according to people familiar with the matter who discussed details of the process that led to the deal.

Mr. Pompeo wanted to know if the U.S. could secure a deal that would allow President Trump to pull all troops out of Afghanistan, while delivering assurances on terrorism and ensuring the Taliban and government would talk to each other, the people said.

Mr. Khalilzad agreed to the challenge, with a rough, one-year deadline in mind. The first meeting with the Taliban took place at the Qatari foreign ministry in Doha. The first steps at best were tentative: Mr. Khalilzad conveyed U.S. interest in a political settlement. The Taliban recapped the history of talks, the people said.

In Washington, many were skeptical that the Taliban's political office really represented the group. The U.S. pressed Pakistan to release Mullah Baradar, the movement's co-founder, to allow him to take part in the negotiations. Islamabad released him in October 2018, and two months later, the Taliban announced Mullah Baradar would lead the talks in Doha.

Throughout 2019, Mr. Khalilzad and his team of negotiators talked with Mullah Baradar and other Taliban officials, meeting in Doha to discuss the thorniest issues.

One of the toughest was persuading the Taliban, in renouncing support for terrorism, to specifically name al Qaeda in a final agreement document, a process that took several months. The final agreement doesn't contain the word ""terrorist"" or express regret for past actions, but contains a promise to break ties with the group.

For the Taliban, a key issue was the removal of ""foreign forces,"" mainly meaning U.S. troops, although several thousand allied troops are still in Afghanistan. The Taliban wanted the Americans to leave within several months; a 14-month period was included in the agreement instead.

The U.S. said that, conditions permitting, it would reduce its troops from about 13,000 now to 8,600 in an initial period of 135 days, which was spelled out in the agreement. If other conditions are met, the remaining U.S. forces would leave next year.

The Taliban also resisted including intra-Afghan talks as part of the deal. In the end, the agreement provides only for the start of such talks, without stipulating an outcome.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Constitutional Case of the Year

856 words
3 March 2020

Copyright 2020 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 

The Supreme Court hears what may be its most important case of the year on Tuesday, and don't stop reading because it concerns the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. This one goes to the heart of the separation of powers and whether the administrative state is accountable to the people.

Seila Law v. CFPB concerns whether a President can remove the bureau's director only for ""inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office."" This should be an easy call, but far more important is the remedy and whether the Justices merely sever the bureau's mutant head from its unconstitutional body.

Democrats created the CFPB in 2010 as an independent agency within the Federal Reserve. Yet unlike other independent agencies, it was designed to be politically insulated. The bureau gets funding automatically upon its director's request from the Fed, so it doesn't need Congressional appropriations.

Most agencies are led by a multi-member bipartisan commission, but the CFPB has a single director whom the President can only fire for cause. Congress gave the bureau broad enforcement power to investigate and penalize almost any business with any relation to finance. But its rules and orders are exempt from review by the Fed, and it needn't consult the White House budget office. The director, in short, is President of his own little government.

There have only been three independent analogs to the CFPB in history: the Office of Independent Counsel, the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). None possess the CFPB's enormous regulatory powers.

Congress established the Independent Counsel within the Justice Department after Watergate to oversee executive officers, but Congress declined to reauthorize it after Ken Starr's probe of Bill Clinton. The FHFA's structure is currently being litigated, and even Mr. Clinton once mused that the SSA's single director raised a ""significant constitutional question.""

As an appellate judge in 2016, now Justice Brett Kavanaugh ruled in PHH Corp. that the director's dismissal ""for cause"" scheme violates the separation of powers. He also found, however, that this provision could be severed from the rest of the CFPB statute so the bureau could survive. Judge Kavanaugh's ruling was overturned by the full D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, so his opinion has no legal standing. But its logic is crucial now that he is in the High Court and his vote could be decisive.

Judge Kavanaugh may have been trying to show judicial restraint on the D.C. Circuit, but he now has more leeway on the High Court and the case has been better briefed. Only if he reconsiders the severability issue can he address the law's gross separation-of-powers abuses. The director's scheme isn't a mere construct but is central to the law's design to be outside the control of both Congress and the President.

Merely severing the ""for cause"" provision would refashion the bureau into an executive agency like the Environmental Protection Agency but with no Congressional oversight. As the Seila Law brief argues: ""Would Congress have preferred a regime in which the President had control over the agency tasked with enforcing those statutes, yet in which it had surrendered its own primary means of control over that same agency? It does not take a Ouija board to figure out the answer.""

The Court would be rewriting the statute on its own, but without addressing its other constitutional infirmities. The better answer is to declare the entire law unconstitutional and give Congress the chance to rewrite it.

---

This is all the more important these days when the very structure of the separation of powers is under assault. The liberal legal scholar Cass Sunstein, normally a serious fellow, wrote recently that the Justice Department should be independent of the President. Alexander Hamilton would have devoted several Federalist Papers to refuting that idea of a chief executive for prosecutions.

If the Supreme Court lets the CFPB stand as it is, and merely skirts around the edges of its illegality by barring the ""for cause"" provision, this will not be the last such agency that Congress creates. The administrative state will become even less accountable to political control than it already is.

Tossing the whole law would invalidate all CFPB actions to date, but the Court also did this when it overturned Barack Obama's illegal recess appointments in Noel Canning (2014). In the CFPB there may be fewer reliance interests since reverting to the pre-Dodd Frank status quo would leave other independent agencies to enforce consumer financial laws.

Our suggestion is that the Court strike down the law but delay the ruling's implementation for a year or so to give Congress and the President time to amend the law if they see fit. If the current Court is serious about reviving the original meaning of the separation of powers, the CFPB is an ideal opportunity to send a shot heard 'round Washington.

(See related letter: ""Letters to the Editor: Supreme Court Funded Via Congress, Why Not CFPB?"" -- WSJ Mar. 11, 2020)

Life & Arts: In 'ZeroZeroZero,' A Gritty, Global Tale of Drug Trade

A shipment of cocaine's impact on the lives of the rich and poor is given a kaleidoscopic perspective in Amazon Prime's new eight-part dramatic series ""ZeroZeroZero.""

It is the latest series after ""Narcos,"" ""McMafia"" and ""Gomorrah"" to take a global view of crime. In this tale, which premiers Friday on Amazon Prime, Italian writer and director Stefano Sollima takes viewers across three different continents, and manages an internationally diverse cast and crew speaking several languages.

In the series, Mr. Sollima and his co-directors (Pablo Trapero and Janus Metz) focus on the small-time dealers of a Calabrian cartel that purchases the cocaine; the Mexican cartel that is selling it; and the Lynwoods: a wealthy American shipping family that brokers the deal.

As was the case with ""Gomorrah,"" which became Italy's most popular television export to date, Mr. Sollima's basis for ""ZeroZeroZero"" is a nonfiction bestseller by Italian investigative journalist Roberto Saviano. The title riffs on the rating system for Italian baking flour where ""zero, zero"" is the top grade of purity.

As a writer and director Mr. Sollima is known for a gritty realism that captures the neon glitter, concrete and shadowy back streets of cities. His latest series is in English, Spanish and Calabrian dialect with subtitles. Mr. Sollima, 53, has always insisted on using the appropriate dialect on his projects, whether the Roman street slang of the 1970s for ""Romanzo Criminale"" or the Neapolitan lingo in ""Gomorrah.""

""I am always looking to make something as close to reality as possible,"" Mr. Sollima says. ""Getting the language right helps to create a strange and electric atmosphere.""

The Wall Street Journal spoke to Mr. Sollima, who has also directed movies like ""Sicario: Day of the Soldado"" (2018), about the cocaine economy and the challenges of shooting a global TV series. Here, an edited transcript.

WSJ: What were the challenges of turning a nonfiction book like ""ZeroZeroZero"" into a fictional TV series?

A: Roberto Saviano's book was a journalistic expose so it provided a lot of great information without any narrative structure. What we did basically was to take some of the different worlds that he explored in ""ZeroZeroZero"" and develop those, while trying to stay true to the spirit of his book. We took inspiration for most of the characters from real-life people but I don't think audiences will be able to recognize who they are.

WSJ: Were you convinced by the thesis of Mr. Saviano's book that through the cocaine trade you can see the world?

A: Yes, for me the book's a really smart take on globalization through the prism of one of the world's most controversial merchandises: Cocaine. It is fascinating to see how all the countries that are affected by narcotrafficking change because of money that has been laundered and recycled into their economies. Even for those not using or dealing cocaine it has become part of our lives because of the incredible amount of money it generates.

WSJ: In Mr. Saviano's book he argues for the legalization of cocaine but you don't put forward that argument in the series. Why?

A: I don't feel that a TV show or a movie is a place where you should get political. When you're dealing with a really complex matter like this one I think it's better to ask smart questions than give unhelpful answers. It's up to the audience to have its own point of view on this topic.

WSJ: ""ZeroZeroZero"" was shot in Italy, the U.S., Mexico, Morocco and Senegal. Did you face any difficulties?

A: Yes, we ran into political problems in Mexico. We were supposed to shoot most of our scenes in Monterrey. But when we were about to start filming there [in 2018] a lot of people were killed during the local elections. So we had to move our shoot because it wasn't safe for us. We also experienced logistical problems in Calabria because we shot up in the mountains where it was pretty tough to transport our crew and equipment.

WSJ: ""ZeroZeroZero"" portrays a world without any moral point of view to latch onto. Do you think this is more of a European sensibility than an American one?

A: I don't know about that. It's more my sensibility. I have never liked to express my moral point of view in my work. The challenge is to portray a world as it is without any filter and without judging. For me that is at the heart of good storytelling. I think audiences are smart enough not to need a guide telling them how they should be feeling.

WSJ: Andrea Riseborough plays Emma Lynwood, a woman who is thrust into a male-dominated world yet is never overawed by it. Was this a character inspired by someone in real life?

A: No, she was a pure invention. The Lynwood family doesn't have any inspiration from real life. I thought it was cool to have a woman who is handling the family business. Her father is the figurehead of the family shipping company but she is the one who does everything that needs to be done. In the beginning she opposes her father because she would like the family's business to be legitimate. But she discovers that's not possible because everything that is legitimate in their company is dependent on the incredible amount of money that comes from the drug trafficking.

WSJ: Now that you've been courted by Hollywood are you still planning to keep developing Italian projects?

A: That is what I am trying to do. Right after ""Soldado"" I did ""ZeroZeroZero"" which for the most part is a European production that started as an Italian project. It's interesting to see a foreign movie like ""Parasite"" win the Academy Award. With the advent of streaming platforms like Netflix and Amazon people have grown used to watching drama from foreign countries. Modern audiences are curious and not bothered by subtitles. I think that existed before ""Parasite"" which has just confirmed what we already know.

The global networks of modern crime are reflected in a growing number of television series shot in multiple languages. Here are other series in the same genre:

""McMafia"" (AMC)

This eight-part crime drama was inspired by British journalist Misha Glenny's 2008 nonfiction book ""McMafia: A Journey Through the Global Criminal Underworld."" Its filming locations included London, Croatia, Qatar, Mumbai, Prague, Cairo, Belgrade, Belize, Istanbul, Moscow and Tel Aviv. A second season was recently commissioned by the BBC.

""Narcos"" (Netflix)

This American crime drama is mostly set and filmed in Colombia, but with some scenes in the United States. The first two out of three seasons focus on the rise and fall of Pablo Escobar. The dialogue switches between Spanish and English. A spin-off series ""Narcos: Mexico,"" which explores the origin of the modern war on drugs, premiered its second season last month.

""The Bureau"" (iTunes)

This French political thriller about terror-related crimes focuses on the lives of agents working for the DGSE, France's main external security service. Its first four seasons were shot between Paris and Morocco which stood in for locations in Algeria, Iran and Syria. A fifth season was recently commissioned by Canal+.

""Giri/Haji"" (Netflix)

This eight-part British crime thriller set in Tokyo and London switches dialogue between English and Japanese. It follows a Tokyo detective who travels to London in search of his brother, who he previously thought was dead. It contrasts the criminal codes of the Yakuza with unruly elements of the London underworld.

Warren, Unlike Sanders, Makes the Medicare Math Add Up

Bernie Sanders released an updated plan last week to pay for Medicare for All. The plan is light on details, but leaves the senator at least $12.5 trillion short of covering the cost of his health-care proposal over 10 years. It calls for some tax increases on working families, but the real burden may be much higher than advertised: Mr. Sanders may have to raise taxes on American workers by 16 percentage points or more to avoid multitrillion-dollar deficits. Fortunately, Elizabeth Warren's financing plan for Medicare for All offers a better alternative.

Mr. Sanders's blueprint identifies $17.5 trillion in new federal revenue over the next 10 years, sourced to new or higher taxes on workers and corporations, among other changes to the code. Mr. Sanders bases his calculations on a study by Yale researchers published recently in the Lancet, which found that his plan would reduce national health spending from $52 trillion over a decade to $47 trillion. Mr. Sanders claims he will redirect the current projected $30 trillion in federal, state and local health-care spending over the next decade to Medicare for All. Thus, he says he only needs $17 trillion to fill the gap.

There are three problems with his math. First, the Yale study didn't account for the cost of Mr. Sanders's long-term care program -- estimated at around $2.5 trillion. Second, the study assumed reimbursement cuts to hospitals that Mr. Sanders hasn't explicitly endorsed. Third, Mr. Sanders's $30 trillion in projected federal spending includes funding for the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and more. This money can't be spent on Medicare for All unless it is zeroed out from these vital public-health agencies.

Most analyses have found that the Sanders Medicare for All proposal would require around $30 trillion in new federal spending over a decade. That leaves Mr. Sanders $12.5 trillion short of what he needs to cover the cost of his plan.

How could Mr. Sanders fill the gap? His plan includes two proposals that affect middle-class families. One is a 4% ""income-based premium"" on workers, which excludes the first $29,000 in income for a family of four. This ""premium"" would be an additional tax on income above the exclusion floor, and presumably even less income would be excluded for single workers or those without children. The senator says this tax will generate $4 trillion over 10 years. To make up the $12.5 trillion shortfall, that tax would need to be roughly four times as large -- the equivalent of a tax increase of 16% of income.

Mr. Sanders's second proposal is a 7.5% payroll tax paid by employers that exempts the first $1 million of a company's payroll. Mr. Sanders estimates this would generate $5.2 trillion over 10 years. To generate the missing $12.5 trillion, that payroll tax rate would need to reach roughly 26.5%. And while the employer receives the bill, higher payroll taxes are mostly passed on to workers in lower wages, reduced hours or both.

Mr. Sanders could raise taxes on the wealthy and big corporations. But he already plans to do that: His financing for Medicare for All and other plans includes a wealth tax, a substantial corporate tax increase, a financial-transactions tax, an increase in the top personal tax rate, and a capital-gains tax increase. There isn't room to squeeze trillions in additional revenue out of these sources.

Mr. Sanders is adamant that total costs for middle-class families will go down, because new taxes will be less than what families save on health-care costs. This is plausible in the aggregate at certain income levels. But it is implausible that every middle-class family will come out ahead -- especially if the plan is fully paid for in taxes.

The plan Ms. Warren released in October addresses these vulnerabilities. Unlike Mr. Sanders's plan, it commits to specific reimbursement rates for health-care providers -- roughly 110% of current Medicare rates. Her plan brings the overall cost of Medicare for All down to $20.5 trillion over 10 years, according to an analysis I did with Donald Berwick, who ran the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Obama. Ms. Warren's plan doesn't raise taxes on the middle class. Every business that pays for employee health insurance today will pay less for each employee during the transition.

As Democrats choose a nominee, they should consider which candidate's Medicare for All financing plan is best for working families and provides the most appealing general election message.

U.S. News: High Court to Take Up ACA Case --- A ruling, likely not before the election, will potentially address all parts of health law

WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court agreed to once again decide the fate of the Affordable Care Act, but it likely won't do so before the 2020 presidential election.

The court on Monday announced it would consider an appeal by a group of Democratic-led states that are defending the 2010 health-care overhaul legislation, a signature achievement for President Obama. The ACA is under legal attack from a group of Republican states, which found a new tactic for challenging the law in 2018 -- based on a provision requiring Americans to buy health insurance or pay a penalty -- after the Supreme Court previously preserved the ACA in decisions in 2012 and in 2015.

The high court isn't placing the case on an accelerated schedule, meaning the justices won't get to it before their summer break. Instead, the case will be scheduled for the court's next term, which begins in October 2020 and runs through the following June.

The timing means the decision is unlikely to come before Election Day, leaving the ACA in legal limbo. The slower timeline also means the Trump administration won't necessarily be forced to grapple with U.S. health-care policy before voters go to the polls.

In weighing the case, the justices could rule on the viability of every provision of the sweeping law. In addition to the mandate that most people carry health insurance, the ACA barred insurers from denying coverage -- or charging more -- to people with existing health conditions. It also allowed young adults to stay on their parents' plans until they turned 26 and expanded the availability of Medicaid coverage for limited-income Americans.

The ACA contains hundreds of other provisions, including ones that require contraception coverage and federally recommended vaccines to be covered at no cost, and that mandate nutritional labeling on restaurant menus and vending machines.

The New Orleans-based Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in December that the individual insurance mandate, a central feature of the ACA, was unconstitutional.

The ruling avoided saying whether the rest of the sprawling health law could remain in force without the mandate. The appeals court instead ordered the Texas judge who first heard the case to reconsider his decision that no part of the ACA remained valid.

The health law remains in effect during the litigation. President Trump has pledged to roll it back and has long promised to release his own health plan. His administration isn't defending the law in court and instead is siding with the challengers in the case.

Republican plaintiffs, led by the state of Texas, found an opening to challenge the law anew after Congress in 2017 reduced the insurance-mandate penalty to $0. The change came as part of a broad tax-overhaul package passed by a GOP Congress and signed by Mr. Trump.

Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said, ""Without the individual mandate, the entire law becomes unsupportable. The federal government cannot order private citizens to purchase subpar insurance that they don't want, and I look forward to finally settling the matter before the U.S. Supreme Court.""

Lower courts agreed with that argument. Congress's taxing power was central to the majority opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts in 2012 to uphold the insurance mandate.

The law's supporters say it doesn't make sense that the mandate would suddenly become unconstitutional now that it is less burdensome.

The same five justices that upheld the ACA in 2012 remain on the court.

California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who leads a coalition of 20 states and Washington, D.C. defending the ACA, said he was pleased with the high court's decision to hear their appeal. ""As Texas and the Trump administration fight to disrupt our health-care system and the coverage that millions rely upon, we look forward to making our case in defense of the ACA,"" he said.

The Justice Department, which is representing the Trump administration in court, declined to comment.

It Is Too Soon to Buy Stocks on Coronavirus Dip --- Shares seem cheaper but might soon look more expensive as forecasts catch up with situation

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

How far do stocks have to fall before they are worth buying? Part of what has made the market so perilous is that, without the ability to even roughly estimate what the ultimate effect of the novel coronavirus's spread will be on profits and the economy, it is impossible to tell.

In the space of less than two weeks since it last hit a record high, the S&P 500 has fallen about 9%. That has made the index appear far less expensive: It now trades at about 17.6 times analysts' estimated 2020 earnings, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv, down from 19.2 at its peak.

Yet over that time profit estimates have barely budged, and analysts' current forecasts imply earnings per share for companies in the S&P 500 will rise by 7.4% this year from last.

As a group, analysts have a deserved reputation for hands-over-their-eyes optimism, and indeed at least until recently many of them were seriously underestimating the effects of the outbreak. But that isn't entirely what is going on here.

Rather, because they lack the information they need to incorporate the coronavirus epidemic into their estimates, analysts are largely letting their stale estimates stand while acknowledging that the risks are skewed substantially to the downside.

They are following the lead of companies that, insofar as they have reduced sales and earnings forecasts as a result of the coronavirus epidemic, have only done so if they already have experienced quantifiable direct effects to their businesses.

Economists and strategists have begun forecasting much more severe coronavirus effects than what analyst estimates and corporate earnings and sales guidance show.

Goldman Sachs economists, for example, have lowered their estimates for both global and U.S. gross domestic product, and Goldman strategist David Kostin is now forecasting no earnings growth. If that is right, the S&P 500 trades at about 18.7 times expected earnings -- about 6% richer a valuation than what a price-earnings ratio using analyst estimates suggests.

Yet Mr. Kostin's estimate has large error bars around it given that economists, too, are in the dark about what the coronavirus impact will be. Goldman's economists, for example, have trimmed their U.S. GDP estimates repeatedly over the past month or so, including over the weekend. Toward the end of January, they estimated GDP would grow at a 2% annual rate in the first quarter and 2.6% in the second quarter. Now they expect GDP will grow by just 0.9% in the first quarter, not at all in the second and with a recovery beginning in the third. They also reckon the Federal Reserve will cut its target range on overnight rates by half a percentage point this month, and another half thereafter. Like most economists, Goldman's think the U.S. will avoid a recession, but they note ""the downside risks have clearly grown."" And if there is a recession? Then Mr. Kostin thinks earnings will fall by 13%. But again, that is just a forecast. Investors tempted by apparent bargains should think twice.

U.S. News: Bump-Stock Ban Allowed to Stand

The Supreme Court on Monday refused to consider a challenge by certain gun owners to the Trump administration's ban on bump stocks, rapid-fire devices that were used in the 2017 Las Vegas mass shooting.

The court, in a brief written order, let stand an appeals court decision last year that said gun owners had failed to show the Justice Department acted unreasonably and outside its legal authority when it prohibited bump stocks.

President Trump has courted gun-rights advocates by voicing support for strong Second Amendment protections. But in the wake of the Las Vegas massacre, which left 58 victims dead, he ordered his administration to ban devices that effectively turn legal weapons into machine guns, which are generally prohibited by federal law.

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, part of the Justice Department, followed with a regulation in late 2018 that did so. Attorney General William Barr signed off on the ban after he took office.

Gun owners that filed suit argued the ATF's regulation marked a departure from how the agency had previously interpreted statutes addressing machine guns.

The Justice Department said its approach reflected the best interpretation of federal law.

A divided appeals court rejected the challengers' claims in April, and the Supreme Court's order left that decision in place.

The high court previously declined to temporarily halt the ban before it went into effect last year.

Grammys Chief Ousted After Investigation

The organization that hands out the Grammys said it fired its chief executive, Deborah Dugan, more than six weeks after placing her on administrative leave amid conflicting allegations of harassment.

The Recording Academy's board placed Ms. Dugan, its first female CEO, on involuntary leave just a few days before its flagship awards show, saying a subordinate had complained that Ms. Dugan had treated her abusively. Ms. Dugan responded in a discrimination complaint a few days later that it was she who had been harassed by the academy's general counsel, Joel Katz. Ms. Dugan alleged in the complaint that Mr. Katz, a music-industry lawyer, invited her to a private dinner soon after she was named CEO, at which he called her ""baby,"" made inappropriate comments about her appearance and tried to kiss her.

A lawyer for Ms. Dugan said Monday: ""The decision is despicable and, in due course, the Academy, [its] leadership and its attorneys will be held accountable under the law.""

Howard Weitzman, a lawyer for Mr. Katz, said in January that Ms. Dugan's allegations ""are false and Mr. Katz categorically and emphatically denies her version of that evening.""

The academy released a letter on Monday saying it had commissioned two independent investigations: one into the allegations against Ms. Dugan, the other into her own complaints. In a separate statement, the vice chair of the academy's board of trustees, Tammy Hurt, said ""the investigation overwhelmingly confirmed the serious complaints that had been lodged against her by a multitude of Recording Academy staff members.""

Without offering further details on the allegations against Ms. Dugan or the investigations' findings, the organization indicated its board chairman, Harvey Mason Jr., would continue serving as interim CEO as it begins searching for a new permanent chief.

Ms. Dugan was named CEO last summer. Her predecessor, Neil Portnow, resigned after making public remarks that were widely interpreted as sexist. Mr. Portnow told an interviewer that women who want to rise through the music industry's ranks should ""step up.""

Ms. Dugan's discrimination complaint against the academy raised several allegations, including that board members had conflicts of interest and that the organization's awards-voting system was rigged. The academy's statement on Monday called such allegations ""unwarranted and damaging.""

Chinese Businesses Start to Feel Squeezed

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

The last time most people saw a chart as cliff-shaped as China's February purchasing managers index was probably during the global financial crisis.

Quarantine measures to contain the coronavirus have all but brought the economy to a halt: The headline factory PMI dropped nearly 15 points to its weakest level ever. The services PMI fell even further.

Investors, who pushed the Shanghai bourse up 3% Monday, are betting this is a clear case of bad news equals good news. Surely the central bank will ride to the rescue?

More help from Beijing is definitely coming, but the scale of the response may not be as large as investors hope for the simple reason that China's banking system isn't well-equipped to help the small businesses most at risk.

There were a few encouraging signs from the PMI. Around 80% of medium- and large-size enterprises are now open again, according to the statistics bureau.

But the overall picture remains grim. Only 58% of migrant workers who left major cities before the Lunar New Year holiday had returned by Sunday, according to Morgan Stanley. Intracity traffic congestion remains about 20% lower than at the same time last year.

And as restaurants and factories sit idle, companies with high fixed costs -- like salaried employees and debt payments -- are burning cash.

The first quarter is always tough for such businesses in China because of bonuses paid to employees, combined with the long holiday. The coronavirus has supercharged the problem. ANZ Bank estimates the quarantine measures will cost corporate China at least 2.6 trillion yuan ($372 billion) in cash flow in the first quarter, while consulting firm Gavekal puts the hit at around 4 trillion yuan.

Large listed companies and state-owned firms can survive by borrowing, squeezing suppliers or simply running down cash balances.

But small private companies that don't have large cash reserves and have trouble getting loans from the state-owned banking system may have no choice but to cut staff, salaries or investment. The hit could be substantial: Gavekal estimates companies could be forced to cut investment by 2 trillion yuan, about 2% of gross domestic product.

Policy makers will probably try to offset some of this with higher investment in public works. More government debt issuance seems likely in coming weeks. Banking regulators are also telling lenders to give small businesses a break on debt repayment in the first half.

But none of this adds up to a 2009-style stimulus yet. Even assuming some catch-up in the second quarter, significantly slower growth this year looks baked in the cake.

World News: OECD Warns Epidemic Threatens Growth

Global economic growth will slow sharply this year as governments attempt to contain the coronavirus epidemic, although the scale of the setback is highly uncertain, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said.

In its ""best case"" scenario, the Paris-based research body on Monday said the global economy would grow by 2.4%, weaker than the 2.9% expansion projected before the viral outbreak. That lost growth is roughly equivalent to $400 billion. But it said much more severe slowdowns are possible.

Global growth slowed in 2019, and was particularly weak in the final three months of the year. Given that starting point, the OECD said it is possible the global output will fall during the first three months of this year, putting the economy at risk of recession.

However, the research body is forecasting a rebound in growth during 2021, assuming the outbreak is contained over the coming months. But that recovery wouldn't be immediate, and some lost output would never be recovered.

""It's not like it plunges and then it recovers quickly,"" said Laurence Boone, the OECD's chief economist.

To date, the outbreak has been most severe in China, and the government has responded with travel bans and quarantine requirements that have closed factories and left service providers without customers.

In its best-case scenario, the OECD forecasts that China's economy will grow 4.9% this year, down from its previous projection of 5.7%. However, it expects growth to rebound to 6.4% in 2021, having previously forecast an expansion of 5.5%.

Leaders of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund said Monday they are prepared to use tools including emergency financing to help countries address the coronavirus.

""We will use our available instruments to the fullest extent possible, including emergency financing, policy advice and technical assistance,"" they said.

IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva and World Bank President David Malpass said international cooperation is essential to deal with the health and economic effects. Finance ministers for the Group of Seven advanced economies plan to hold a conference call Tuesday morning to discuss their response to the virus, a U.S. Treasury spokeswoman confirmed.

In the U.S., the factory sector remained narrowly in expansion territory in February, although concerns about the coronavirus and its impact on supply chains rattled manufacturers.

The Institute for Supply Management said Monday its manufacturing index fell to 50.1 in February from 50.9 in January. Readings above 50 indicate activity is expanding across the manufacturing sector, while those below 50 signal contraction.

""Tariffs have been overshadowed by the global coronavirus disruptions as the top issue on supply chain managers' agendas -- at 42% of general comments, up from 2.5% in January,"" said Tim Fiore, who oversees the ISM survey of factory purchasing and supply managers. ""I don't think we've hit the peak of the impact.""

A survey of businesses released Monday by data firm IHS Markit found that manufacturing activity in China experienced its steepest slump on record during February. The country's Purchasing Managers Index fell to 40.3 from 50.1 in January, its lowest level since April 2004. A reading below 50 points to a drop in activity.

China accounts for a little more than 16% of global economic output, so disruption in the world's second-largest economy is expected to have an impact on a number of other economies. The OECD said those with the closest links -- Japan, South Korea and Australia -- will suffer most from a drop in Chinese tourists, a fall in Chinese demand for commodities and other goods, and an interruption in the supply of Chinese-made parts that are needed to complete products made in other countries.

The OECD said that makers of computers, electronics, pharmaceuticals and transport equipment around the world are particularly reliant on Chinese parts.

Teen Suspect's Understanding Is Key

Whether young criminal suspects are capable of understanding the criminal-justice system and their Miranda rights might be tested in the case of a 13-year-old boy charged in the killing of a Barnard College student.

Last week, a lawyer for the teen asked a judge to allow two experts on teens' comprehension to serve at his murder trial as witnesses.

One expert, Jennifer Woolard, a professor of psychology at Georgetown University, has compared teens' ability to understand the legal process with that of mentally ill adults.

Suspects younger than 14 perform poorly in their understanding of the legal processes, with roughly one-third of them showing ""a level of impairment consistent with that of persons found incompetent to stand trial,"" according to a study she co-wrote.

The other expert, Emily Haney-Caron, an assistant professor of psychology at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, has argued that suspects younger than 15 should be prohibited from waiving their Miranda rights because they aren't mature enough to understand the consequences of talking to police without counsel.

Miranda warnings state that a suspect has the right to remain silent and have a lawyer present. Their roles in juvenile cases have been questioned by some attorneys who argue that certain young defendants don't understand the crucial need to exercise those rights.

New York state family court Judge Carol Goldstein on Friday prohibited Ms. Haney-Caron from testifying in the boy's trial, citing insufficient evidence of her expertise on Miranda rights and teens. However, the judge permitted Ms. Woolard to testify Friday. The boy's trial is set to begin in the coming weeks.

Ms. Haney-Caron and Ms. Woolard declined to comment.

The 13-year-old is charged as a minor with murder in the second degree and robbery in the first degree in the fatal stabbing of Tessa Majors, an 18-year-old freshman who was killed Dec. 11 in Manhattan's Morningside Park. He has denied the charges through his attorneys and is being held as he awaits his trial.

Two other boys, both 14, were arrested and charged with murder as adults. They have pleaded not guilty.

The day after the killing, the 13-year-old was interviewed at Manhattan's 26th Precinct by New York Police Department Detective Wilfredo Acevedo. The boy's uncle was present, but the boy had no lawyer.

In the interview, the boy admitted to participating in the killing of Ms. Majors, Detective Acevedo said at a hearing in December. The detective said he recited the Miranda warning for the teen before the interview.

Marsha Levick, chief legal officer at the Philadelphia-based Juvenile Law Center, who co-wrote a 2018 academic journal article with Ms. Haney-Caron, cited research on brain development to assert young teens lack the capacity to give valid waivers to their Miranda rights. ""The law has not caught up with the science in this issue,"" Ms. Levick said in an interview.

Some evidence suggests juveniles are more likely than adults to confess to crimes they didn't commit. Thirty-eight percent of exonerations for crimes allegedly committed by youth under 18 involved false confessions, compared with 11% for adults, according to one study of individuals who were wrongly convicted and later cleared of all charges.

NYPD spokeswoman Devora Kaye said a large number of experienced homicide investigators in the case of Ms. Majors ""have used proven legally permissible methods that have been upheld by the courts to bring justice for the victim and her family.""

""From the outset, given the seriousness of the crime, as well as the age of the suspects, the department proceeded with careful consideration,"" Ms. Kaye said.

Both a representative for the city attorneys who are prosecuting the boy and a representative for the boy's defense attorney, Legal Aid Society lawyer Hannah Kaplan, declined to comment.

Liz Crotty, a former Manhattan assistant district attorney, said other evidence, besides the boy's alleged statements, would be important for prosecutors in the case. ""You have to look at the totality of the factors, I think, even more so when it's younger children,"" Ms. Crotty said.

Eugene O'Donnell, professor of law and police studies at John Jay College, said it is important to make sure statements by young suspects are given freely and knowingly because the unfiltered claims by the accused can be powerful for jurors. ""Once a jury hears out of the mouths of kids they're implicating themselves, it's really powerful evidence,"" he said.

Outbreak Pounds European Bank Stocks

European banks have long been considered one of the weaker links in the global financial system. The coronavirus outbreak on the continent poses a fresh test of their health.

Shares in European banks have been among the worst hit since the virus began to spread, first through Italy, and now through much of the rest of the region. Their stocks took another hammering Monday amid signs the impact of the virus is starting to hurt economies, which has immediate effects on banks' business of taking and lending money.

Shares of UniCredit SpA and Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, both based in Milan, the epicenter of the virus outbreak in Europe, fell 4.4% and 2.8% respectively.

Germany's Deutsche Bank AG, which is undergoing a big overhaul, was seeing its stock make rare gains until the coronavirus took effect. Shares of the bank fell 1.5% Monday after falling 17% last week.

France's BNP Paribas SA and Societe Generale SA are down close to 20% this year. Asia-focused but London-listed Standard Chartered PLC and HSBC Holdings PLC have also seen their shares fall sharply.

Already toiling amid negative rates and slow growth, banks have been slashing costs to survive. Now they face the prospect of the economies and companies they serve being hit by the coronavirus outbreak, worsening a challenging outlook.

The cost of funding of major European banks -- a measure of how risky investors perceive them to be -- has risen sharply since last week as markets grapple with the speed at which the virus spread to the continent. Bank stocks, meanwhile, have sunk, leaving many banks deeper into the red.

""The market conditions and sentiment continue to head south, with no bottom as-of-yet seen,"" said Tom Kinmonth, a fixed-income strategist at Dutch bank ABN AMRO.

Banks in Europe are better equipped to face a crisis since boosting capital and liquidity levels following the sovereign- debt crisis in 2010. Funding costs are still below those at the start of last year despite last week's spike, Mr. Kinmonth said. But a global recession would translate into a pickup in defaults and souring loans, forcing banks to take losses and hurting already weak profitability.

Rattled markets, meanwhile, will hurt investment-banking activities and private-banking operations. Deutsche Bank, Barclays PLC and Swiss banks such as Credit Suisse AG and UBS Group AG would be particularly hit, RBC Capital Markets analysts said.

""The key question mark revolves around the depth and length of the [virus] containment measures, and the impact these will have on the economies, which would then in turn affect bank financials, starting from asset quality,"" said Marco Troiano, deputy head of the banks team at rating agency Scope Ratings.

Italian lenders are particularly vulnerable on that front. Some northern Italian towns were quarantined over a week ago as cases of the virus surged. Two regions most affected -- Lombardy, where Milan is the capital, and Veneto, home to Venice -- account for almost a third of the country's economic output and about 40% of Italy's exports.

Any sharper slowdown will affect people's ability to pay their debts. While bad loans from the past crisis have fallen in recent years, they still account for 7% of the total in the system.

Jerome Legras, head of research at Axiom Alternative Investments, said disruption for banks is more akin to the panic seen after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in New York, rather than the sovereign-debt crisis that put European countries in a multiyear recession.

Still, he said he is being cautious on banks that have a large international footprint, especially in Asia, and lenders that are sensitive to low rates, in case central banks decide to react.

The gloomy tone comes as many European banks reported disappointing results for last year, with most blaming low or negative interest rates that have eaten into their profit margins to a point they can't cover their costs. One of the hopes for the sector has been consolidation, particularly after the European Central Bank, which supervises the continent's largest banks, showed willingness to ease the process, which is risky and expensive.

Last month, Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo launched a 4.9 billion euro ($5.4 billion) takeover bid for a smaller rival UBI Banca SpA, with many expecting other deals to come. But the current market commotion will likely freeze any merger discussions, analysts say.

WASHINGTON -- Novartis AG's Sandoz subsidiary will pay a $195 million criminal penalty for fixing prices on generic drugs, the Justice Department announced Monday.

The department said Sandoz admitted it was guilty of participating in several conspiracies to rig bids and fix prices on an array of generic medicines.

Sandoz entered into a deferred prosecution agreement and is cooperating with the federal government's investigation, the department said. The criminal penalty was the highest the department has assessed for a purely domestic price-fixing cartel, officials said.

Under the agreement, the four felony counts against Sandoz will be dropped after three years if it lives up to its commitments to the Justice Department.

""Today's resolution, with one of the largest manufacturers of generic drugs, is a significant step toward ensuring that prices for generic drugs are set by competition, not collusion, and rooting out antitrust crimes that cheated American purchasers of vital medicines,"" said Assistant Attorney General Makan Delrahim, the Justice Department's antitrust chief.

""We are disappointed that this misconduct occurred in the face of our clear antitrust compliance policies and multiple trainings -- and in full contravention of the company's values,"" said Sandoz President Carol Lynch.

ALBANY -- Former SUNY Polytechnic Institute President Alain Kaloyeros and another scientist are suing an arm of the state university, saying it isn't doing its job to monetize a chip-making process they patented in 2002.

Dr. Kaloyeros, who left the school after he was charged by federal prosecutors in a 2016 bid-rigging scheme, said in a lawsuit filed Friday that the SUNY Research Foundation has deprived him and a former graduate student of tens of millions of dollars of income. The former graduate student, Dr. Ana Londergan, is now an engineer at Qualcomm Inc.

The suit, filed in state court in Albany, seeks monetary damages and demands that the Research Foundation relinquish the patent. The foundation was set up to own and manage the intellectual property of faculty and researchers at the State University of New York's 64 campuses. It is responsible for commercializing patents.

Holly Liapis, a spokeswoman for the SUNY Research Foundation, said it ""has standards and practices for protecting intellectual property, including the transfer of technologies and the management of royalties."" She declined to comment on the litigation.

Dr. Kaloyeros is a leading nanotechnology scientist and helped establish SUNY Polytechnic's campus in western Albany as a research center for companies, including International Business Machines Corp. and Samsung Electronics Co.

After taking office in 2011, Gov. Andrew Cuomo tasked Dr. Kaloyeros with spreading the high-tech school's footprint to develop facilities in other upstate areas, including a solar panel factory in Buffalo. SUNY Poly announced plans for a film studio near Syracuse, a chip fabrication factory outside Utica and a pharmaceutical plant near Dunkirk. Many of the projects were delayed by the charges against Dr. Kaloyeros.

In 2018, Dr. Kaloyeros and three construction executives were found guilty of rigging the bids to build the Buffalo facility as well as a factory in Syracuse. Dr. Kaloyeros was sentenced to 3 1/2 years in prison. He maintained his innocence and remains free pending an appeal.

The patent referenced in the lawsuit relates to a process for using ultrathin layers of cobalt as an interconnection material in microchips. The suit claims an unidentified chip manufacturer began using the process in 2016 without paying any royalties to the foundation, which would then be shared with the inventors.

China Property Market Draws In Bond Investors

Even as home sales in China dry up because of the coronavirus epidemic, international bond investors are keeping faith with major real-estate groups.

The resilience of Chinese property debt contrasts with a steep decline in business, as developers are forced to close sales centers, and with a slide in property shares signaling that the sector's earnings are likely to suffer.

In a Feb. 26 note, Goldman Sachs analysts said recent property-sales volume across 30 major cities was barely a quarter of the seasonal norm. Heavyweight China Evergrande Group, the country's most indebted developer, has moved to drum up business with promotions such as offering steep discounts for residential-property purchases made online.

Despite the challenges, credit markets appear confident that big players have the financial firepower to withstand months of disruption. It helps that many companies issued dollar debt in the first few weeks of this year, shoring up their ability to meet coming obligations.

For example, some recently issued dollar bonds from Evergrande, which pay 11.5% coupons and are due in 2023, were quoted at about 99.1 cents on the dollar on Friday, according to FactSet data. Five-year bonds in rival Kaisa Group Holdings, issued in January, were quoted at 96.8 cents on the dollar. A brief selloff in some sector bonds began in late January but largely retraced within two weeks.

The strong performance also reflects a widespread belief that Chinese authorities could offer extra support to an economically significant sector if needed. ""The government will be pulling whatever levers they can to help this industry through this crisis,"" said Charles Macgregor, head of Asia at Lucror Analytics, a credit-analysis firm. Mr. Macgregor said home purchases should recover as life returns to normal in the second quarter.

Freddy Wong, head of Asia Pacific fixed income at Invesco, said: ""We didn't see a major selloff as the market is expecting incremental policy support as the situation settles down in the coming days and months.""

Given the importance of a healthy property sector to China's economy, Mr. Wong said the government could take measures such as cutting down-payment requirements for home buyers and easing restrictions for firms on buying land for future development.

Some existing moves should help developers' finances. Local governments have stepped in with a variety of short-term measures, including tax relief, easier bank-loan approvals, and allowing developers to extend project delivery dates, according to research from Lucror.

Authorities are giving developers more leeway to borrow in foreign currencies, something the state usually controls tightly.

Fed Cuts Rates Amid Virus Fears --- Stocks, bond yields fall after central bank takes biggest emergency action since '08 crisis

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve executed an emergency half-percentage-point rate cut and markets slid, reflecting fears the coronavirus epidemic is raising recession risks for the U.S. and global economies.

The Fed reduced the federal-funds rate to a range between 1% and 1.25% in the first rate change in between scheduled Fed policy meetings since the 2008 financial crisis. Stock markets fell anyway. Major market indexes declined around 3% and the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury dipped below 1% for the first time as investors sought havens.

The central bank has typically reserved such moves for times when the economic outlook has quickly darkened, as in early 2001 and early 2008, when the U.S. economy was heading into recession.

Recession risks have risen enough to ""warrant a Federal Reserve shock-and-awe approach,"" said Tiffany Wilding, an economist at Pacific Investment Management Co.

The market's moves Tuesday showed the extent to which investors worry the central bank can't on its own prevent a drop-off in confidence and spending without a commanding response from public-health authorities and other government agencies.

The rate cut was approved unanimously by the Fed's rate-setting committee, which met by videoconference on Monday night. In a statement, officials held out the prospect of additional stimulus by pledging to ""act as appropriate"" to support the economy.

Fed officials moved to prevent a pullback in credit availability to households and businesses that could amplify any slowdown in U.S. growth, especially if steps to mitigate the spread of the virus -- school and business closures, canceled public events and changed social behavior, broadly speaking -- curtail spending and depress hiring.

""The virus and measures being taken to contain it will weigh on economic activity here and abroad for some time,"" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a news conference Tuesday.

The Fed's response shows how policy makers are bracing for greater economic distress from a contagious, flulike virus than seemed possible just a week ago.

In China, where nearly 3,000 people have died since the initial outbreak there, steps to contain its spread prompted steep declines in production. The coronavirus has infected more than 10,000 people outside China.

The epidemic roiled global financial markets last week amid signs containment efforts were jeopardized by new clusters in Italy, Iran and South Korea. Stocks posted their largest weekly losses since the 2008 financial crisis. Commodity prices fell, signaling a hit to global demand, and long-term U.S. government-bond yields reached record lows, reflecting lower growth expectations and investors seeking havens.

""The concern was that by the time they got to the meeting, things could have spiraled far enough that they would have a much bigger problem,"" said William English, a former senior Fed economist who now teaches at Yale University, referring to the Fed's scheduled March 17-18 policy meeting.

Positive test results for infections in the U.S. last weekend further raised the prospect of changes to behaviors that could lead to a drop in consumer spending, especially travel, tourism and entertainment.

Even if any shock is temporary, there are big unknowns over how long it will last and how deep output might decline. While an interest-rate cut won't address the cause of the downturn, Mr. Powell said he hoped it could soften damage to spending and confidence, stem financial-market disruptions and speed a recovery once any epidemic is under control.

""A rate cut will not reduce the rate of infection. It won't fix a broken supply chain. We get that,"" Mr. Powell said. ""But we do believe that our action will provide a meaningful boost to the economy.""

When the Fed cut rates three times last year, officials characterized those moves as an insurance policy against the risk of a global slowdown amplified by the U.S.-China trade war. Because the source of the latest shock isn't primarily economic, it could be more difficult for interest-rate policy to buoy consumer spending and confidence.

""Finance didn't start this thing. It's not the Asian debt crisis. It's not a currency crisis, a mortgage crisis. It's not from Fed policy being too tight,"" said Steven Blitz, chief U.S. economist at research firm TS Lombard.

Mr. Blitz said it was reasonable to expect a short but swift downturn that would reverse by the summer, once the impact of the virus fades. But he added it was difficult to tell if other fissures in the economy might now surface after an 11-year rally in the stock market accompanied by a corporate-lending boom, all underwritten by lower interest rates.

""The risk is that whenever any recession takes hold, a different reality can emerge from what caused it once unaccounted-for excesses underlying the U.S. economy are laid bare,"" he said.

A separate risk is that the Fed's response won't be effective without a robust response by public-health authorities that maintains confidence in the nation's ability to contain or mitigate the spread of illness.

Even then, steps to limit outbreaks could lead to changes in social behavior that temporarily depresses spending and curtails hiring. That could lead weak businesses to fail and distressed households to fall behind on monthly payments.

""Right now the public health response is the most important. How effective are they treating people?"" said Claudia Sahm, a former Fed economist who is now economic-policy director at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, a liberal think tank. ""The Fed is not going to be the lead policy lever.""

President Trump in recent days called on the Fed to cut rates and said he was disappointed the central bank didn't do more on Tuesday, repeating his longstanding preference for U.S. borrowing costs to be lower than other advanced economies, including those with negative rates.

Mr. English said while he was confident the Fed wasn't being swayed by political pressure, there is a risk that the central bank's credibility suffers because not everyone will see it that way.

After Tuesday's cut, investors expected the Fed would lower rates again in the coming weeks, including at the March meeting.

Fed officials repeatedly said last year it would be important to act aggressively at the first sign of a downturn in spending or hiring because they have less room to counteract a recession by cutting rates.

Fed officials are likely to look for evidence that businesses not directly affected by the virus are seeing a weakening of demand as they plot their next move. ""Are households and businesses hunkering down to see how this goes? If they see that, the Fed would provide more accommodation,"" Mr. English said.

Minnesota Resorts Are On Thin Ice --- Slush forces new ways to reach fishing spots

LAKE WINNIBIGOSHISH, Minn. -- Tyler Croaker was cutting a new road for his family's ice-fishing resort last week, when he felt the front of his snowplow begin to sink under the ice on the frozen lake. He jammed on his brakes and got lodged about 3 1/2 miles from shore and 15 feet to 30 feet from the bottom.

""It just broke through,"" he said of the 1-ton truck's V-shaped snowplow. Instead of a deep chunk of ice, a thin layer covered a couple of feet of thick slush, into which the truck's plow sank. ""It's the problem all over the lake.""

In Northern Minnesota, ice-fishing is big business. Normally, resorts plow fluffy snow off several feet of solid ice, to create vast networks of roads for anglers to use.

This year, early snows blanketed the ice before it was thick enough to drive on and eventually got so heavy that the ice cracked, just about killing the season. The bad conditions forced resorts to cancel reservations, ask for low-interest state loans and call on every bit of ingenuity at their disposal to salvage what they could.

Since anglers' trucks couldn't go on the ice, some resorts used small SUVs with tracks instead of wheels to ferry guests to fishing spots, dubbing the service ""Uber on the Ice."" Others used suburban-style snowblowers to clear paths that allowed anglers to walk across a thin frozen layer on top of about two feet of slush.

Some simply battled on, plowing a truck-length or two on the crust, until their vehicle broke through. They would then pull the vehicle out, wait a day or two for the cleared area to freeze over, and then drive over that frozen spot until they got stuck again.

""I've never seen anything like this,"" said Tyler's dad, Roger Croaker, 49, who has worked at Nodak Lodge in Bena, Minn., for 31 years and owned it since 2005. His business is down 75% for the season, which ends in mid-March -- a time that makes up about 40% of his yearly revenue.

When Tyler, 31, got stuck, he calmly called his dad, who drove to the rescue over bumpy ice roads in his half-ton pickup. After six or seven attempts, Roger finally pulled the bigger vehicle free of the slushy hole.

Around Thanksgiving, most resorts were celebrating an early freeze, with about a foot of solid ice. Then a series of storms began dumping snow that blanketed the ice in a five-county region from Park Rapids to Kabetogoma, cutting off further freezing of that bottom layer for the rest of the season.

The worst blow came just after Christmas, when about 15 inches of heavy, wet snow was too much for the ice at the bottom of the pile. It cracked under the weight, allowing water to seep up and create a slushy mess -- a rare occurrence so late in the season, when the ice is usually thick and strong.

Most resorts were booked solid in January, the real heart of the season, when anglers would come to catch fish such as Northern Pike and Walleye. Resort owners canceled reservations and posted on social media to turn away day visitors who pay an entrance fee to drive their vehicles onto the frozen roads -- which would normally extend 20 miles to 30 miles across the lakes for many resorts.

""People want to fish so bad. We were getting 180 and 200 phone calls a day... How else do you make it through a Minnesota winter?"" said Kim Leonhardt, 47, who owns High Banks Resort with her husband, Rick, 49. The top layer of slush began to freeze but was nowhere near strong enough to support a snowplow. So High Banks used an armada of tracked SUVs and even a re-purposed van to ferry fishing fans onto the lake.

Still, with limited access during the best ice fishing of the season, business at High Banks is off 40%. The resort counts on ice fishing for about half of its yearly revenue.

Chad Mertz, at the Pines Resort & Campground, had positioned six fishing houses about 2 miles offshore before the post-Christmas storm. He was determined to build a road to them before they sank into the slush. With snow still falling on the thin layer of ice on top of the slush, his plan was to clear what he could to expose the slush to the cold air and allow it to freeze. It was a grind.

At one point, he got four of his trucks trapped between cracks on the ice. The whole crew had to walk home. ""It was cold,"" he said.

On nearby Leech Lake, Adventure North Resort had better luck. The resort set up ice-fishing houses just a quarter of a mile offshore. Instead of using heavier equipment, they got out a small snowblower and kept a path cleared for people to walk out to them.

They ended up having one of their best Januarys, said Shay Fortier, who owns the resort with her husband, Steve Krogen. She said when they took over the resort 19 years ago, a small snowblower was all the equipment they could afford. ""We were returning to our roots,"" she said.

By mid-February, a cold snap was able to penetrate through the slush and snow, and most resorts began making progress creating roads.

Jim and Kathy Mahon of Rochester, Minn., had been forced to head north to Lake of the Woods to get their ice-fishing fix earlier in the season. Last week, they sat sipping beer at the bar of the High Banks after catching more than 100 fish on Lake Winnie, as locals call it.

Mr. Mahon admitted his wife was the real fisher, having caught 61 perch to his 41. She had also won $1 side bets on first fish and biggest fish, Mr. Mahon said.

""You are allowed to use two poles, but they were biting so fast, you only had time to use one,"" Ms. Mahon said.

Banking & Finance: Rate Cut Opens Opportunities for Borrowers to Save

The Federal Reserve cut its short-term benchmark rate by half a percentage point Tuesday. The timing of this rate cut, which comes in between the Fed's scheduled policy meeting, hasn't occurred since the 2008 financial crisis.

This lowers the federal-funds rate to a range between 1% and 1.25%.

Last year, the Fed cut rates three times to keep the U.S. economy moving amid slowing global growth and trade tensions. This year, disruptions from the coronavirus epidemic has unsettled global financial markets, with policy makers preparing for the economic fallout from the spread of the virus. The Fed's next scheduled meeting is March 17-18.

Interest rates affect the cost of borrowing, so falling interest rates can ripple through the cost of mortgages, the interest earned on savings accounts and more. Below, a few things to watch for:

Mortgages

The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 3.45%, according to Freddie Mac. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note -- which has hit record lows in recent days -- is used as a benchmark for different types of loans, including mortgages.

Falling interest rates could also mean it is a good time to consider refinancing. With rates trending down, whether it makes sense to refinance a mortgage now comes down to a host of personal factors. Black Knight Inc., a technology and data firm, reported that refinancing activity has nearly doubled over the past three quarters.

The Fed's previous rate cuts sparked a spending streak among U.S. households, including boosting the mortgage market to its highest level since the financial crisis.

Auto loans

Auto loans have fixed interest rates, which are pegged to Treasury yields, but the falling interest rates won't predict what dealers and lenders can charge for your auto loan. At the end of February, the average rate on a five-year new car loan was 4.56%, according to Bankrate.com.

If you're considering buying a new car or trading up, pay attention to car prices and your existing debt load: Many Americans are now taking out auto loans that last longer than six years, according to Experian PLC, and buying new cars with negative equity.

High-yield savings accounts and CDs

The interest rates offered on savings accounts and many certificates of deposit move with the federal-funds rate.

According to the FDIC, the average annual percentage yield on a one-year CD is 0.48%, and firms are continuing to cut rates on high-yield offerings. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s Marcus account has dropped to 1.7%, and robo advisers Betterment and Wealthfront have also lowered the rates on their saving products to 1.84% and 1.78%, respectively.

Credit cards

A decline in interest rates can sometimes affect the average credit card annual percentage rate, or APR, which is pegged to the prime rate.

However, The Wall Street Journal found that even as interest rates fall, some credit card rates are going up. This is because popular, generous rewards and points programs are costing banks more, so many are raising rates to cover such costs.

According to WalletHub's January report of more than 1,000 credit-card offers, the average APR for those with good credit at the end of 2019 was 20.68%.

Student loans

Falling interest rates may benefit you in other areas of your financial life, but your student loans, unfortunately, are less likely to be affected.

If you have private education loans, you could pay less interest and could consider refinancing. Those rates are tied to the London interbank offered rate.

For those with federal loans, interest rates are already set every May, based on a 10-year Treasury note auction. These interest rates are fixed for the entire life of the loan.

The rate for direct subsidized and unsubsidized undergraduate loans disbursed between now and June 30 is 4.53%. So while this latest drop in interest rates won't currently affect those with federal student loans, next year it could have an impact on loans distributed for the 2020-21 academic year.

U.S. News -- Capital Account: Fiscal Policy, Not Fed, Is Best Virus Remedy

Wall Street and President Trump have begged, admonished and tweeted for the Federal Reserve to come to the economy's rescue. Tuesday morning, the Fed obliged.

But their faith is likely to prove misplaced. The Fed cannot save the U.S. economy from the coronavirus, for two reasons.

First, it can't restart factories that are missing parts as the virus disrupts supply chains, nor can it persuade worried vacationers to fly. Second, and potentially more important, central banks are losing their grip on the business cycle.

The Fed had little interest-rate ammunition with which to boost growth even before Tuesday's cut; the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan effectively have none. The world is facing its first big shock in an era when central banks are no longer omnipotent.

The good news is that the same factors that make monetary policy less potent make fiscal policy even more so. With investors rushing to buy government bonds and driving yields down, the U.S. and other rich governments can borrow all they need to fight the risk of both pandemic and recession risk.

U.S. recessions have historically been precipitated by rising inflation and interest rates, collapsing asset prices, or both. Central banks responded by lowering interest rates and, if necessary, buying assets such as bonds or making direct loans to impaired banks, as they did during the global financial crisis in 2008 to 2009.

Since that crisis, structural factors such as low productivity growth, aging populations and risk aversion kept economic growth and inflation low around the world, making it difficult if not impossible for central banks to raise rates. The ECB and Bank of Japan cut theirs below zero. The Fed raised its short-term interest rate target to between 2.25% and 2.5% in 2018, then had to cut it three times last year, to between 1.5% and 1.75%, because of a global slowdown and trade war.

On Tuesday, it cut its benchmark rate by a half percentage point.

Central banks hoped that with time, inflation and growth would firm enough for interest rates to return to some normal, positive level. The risk was always that some shock would come along to short-circuit that process.

Epidemics historically haven't been disruptive enough to affect gross domestic product much.

That probably won't be true this time. Supply-side disruptions of pandemics have been compounded by demand-side effects: precautionary measures by the authorities, employers and individuals to avoid infection.

These behavioral effects account for 80% to 90% of the economic hit from epidemics, according to work by Warwick McKibbin, an economist at Australian National University. As with a biological or other terrorism threat, ""A large number of people would feel at risk at the onset of a pandemic, even if their actual risk of dying from the disease is low,"" he and a co-author wrote in a report for the Brookings Institution this week.

Goldman Sachs estimates 10% to 15% of U.S. GDP consists of services such as entertainment, restaurants, church services and public transportation that would suffer if people limit interaction and avoid large gatherings. Goldman also estimates the disease will knock roughly 3 percentage points off annualized growth in the next quarter, with these demand-side effects accounting for almost half.

The Fed can't offset these effects, said Jan Hatzius, Goldman's chief economist.

He said the Fed can help cushion the hit to demand when employees lose their jobs because of supply disruptions or consumers staying home, or spending and investment retreat due to lower stock prices and uncertainty. Lower mortgage rates, for example, could add some construction jobs, ""but it's all pretty small.""

Another risk: If the Fed lowers interest rates close to zero to deal with the current crisis it will, like the ECB and Bank of Japan now, have no rate ammunition to deal with the next one.

Nellie Liang, a former Fed economist now at Brookings, said the central bank can take other actions, such as reminding banks they can borrow from the Fed's discount window if they need funds to help their customers, and dissuade them from foreclosing on customers who miss a payment because of the virus.

But the real firepower lies with fiscal policy. Congress is working on a $7 billion to $8 billion package to combat the virus. The U.S. could easily borrow more: Congress authorized $65 billion in recovery spending after the 9/11 attacks, $100 billion after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and $51 billion after Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

President Trump has suggested a payroll-tax cut. On Monday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren proposed $400 billion of stimulus -- roughly 2% of GDP.

Whether that much is needed is unclear. But Ms. Warren is targeting fiscal firepower in a way monetary policy cannot: the Massachusetts Democrat, who is running for president, would cover the bills of patients being tested or treated for the virus and increase health-center capacity.

Some service-sector workers might stay on the job even if they are infected, because they can't afford to stay home. Ms. Warren proposes paying emergency sick leave to anyone with symptoms, or who has a dependent with symptoms, so they can stay home.

That is a twofer: It offers protection against recession and epidemic at the same time.

Tennessee Twisters Kill at Least 25

Tornadoes ripped through Tennessee on Tuesday, killing at least 25 people as the twisters carved a path through scenic mountain communities and razed venues in a trendy Nashville neighborhood.

A line of storms began barreling across Tennessee on Monday, spawning three tornadoes in the middle part of the state while many residents slept, according to the National Weather Service. They smashed homes and businesses and left tens of thousands of residents without power.

Gov. Bill Lee said 19 of the deaths, including some children, took place in Putnam County, about 80 miles east of Nashville and home to parks and waterfalls.

Putnam County Mayor Randy Porter said one possible reason so many people died is that the tornado struck suddenly in the middle of the night when people were asleep and might not have heard warning sirens and cellphone alerts.

""It hit so fast,"" Mr. Porter said. ""A lot of folks didn't have time to take shelter.""

The remainder of the deaths were in the counties of Wilson, Benton and Davidson, home to Nashville. One twister cut through Nashville, hitting neighborhoods including Germantown, an affluent area with upscale apartments and restaurants, and East Nashville, a section with popular bars and music spots.

""It is heartbreaking. We have had loss of life all across the state,"" Mr. Lee said. ""We're doing everything that we can to respond to this.""

Emergency officials answered more than 400 calls and transported about 160 people to hospitals, said Nashville Fire Chief William Swann. At least 48 buildings were destroyed, he said. About 73,000 people were without power in several counties, according to the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency.

Residents described a ravaged landscape of downed power lines, collapsed homes and businesses and debris strewn across the streets. Local officials warned residents to stay off the roads as emergency crews assessed the damage.

""Nashville is hurting, and our community has been devastated,"" Nashville Mayor John Cooper said. ""Together, we will get through this and come out stronger.""

In East Nashville, Matt Niehoff said he woke up a little before 1 a.m. local time Tuesday to what sounded like a low-flying jet, then heard glass shattering in his house and the wind whipping as the tornado tore through. The twister blew in a front window and ripped the roofs off the front porch and garage.

Outside, thick old trees that lined his street toppled and snapped, one landing on a neighbor's roof, said Mr. Niehoff, 36 years old. Blocks away, in the bustling Five Points area, a main street was littered with debris. Some prized businesses, including a burger place, a tea house and a concert venue, were damaged or destroyed.

""It's hard to take in the severity of it,"" Mr. Niehoff said.

Schools were closed Tuesday due to damage, and state offices were shut in at least eight counties, TEMA said.

The extreme weather came as Tennessee was one of 14 states holding primaries on Super Tuesday. Voting still took place, but some polling locations in affected counties were closed or delayed in opening, Secretary of State Tre Hargett said. His office, as well as the Tennessee Democratic Party, were directing voters to alternate locations.

After the state party sued to extend voting hours, a state judge in Davidson County ordered elections officials to keep all polling locations in the county open until 8 p.m. local time and five large stations open until 10 p.m. Mr. Lee said the state deployed generators to some polling stations without power. ""We're going to make it possible for as many folks as we can to vote,"" he said.

Josh Westerhold, a 39-year-old East Nashville resident, said his regular polling station was closed because of the storm. As a result, he went to cast a ballot at a community center that was taking in voters from several other precincts. On Tuesday afternoon, he was still waiting in a snaking line that he estimated would take as much as two hours.

President Trump promised support to rebuild in remarks at the National Association of Counties Legislative Conference. The president said he would visit the state Friday.

In Putnam County, emergency responders were going house to house to assess damage in the hardest-hit neighborhoods.

Sixty-five people were treated at a regional hospital for injuries, said Mr. Porter, the mayor. He said he had taken a helicopter flight in the morning to survey the area and that many homes were completely destroyed.

""It's a pretty wide path of damage,"" Mr. Porter said.

World News: Iran Frees Inmates to Ease Risk

TEHRAN -- Iran is temporarily releasing tens of thousands of prisoners in an attempt to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in the country's crowded prisons, as it struggles to contain one of the worst outbreaks of a disease that has killed dozens of people and infected 23 lawmakers.

More than 54,000 prisoners have gone out on furlough after testing negative for the virus, judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said on Tuesday. He indicated that several prominent Iranian political prisoners and British dual national Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe would be allowed out.

Iran has ramped up efforts to contain the virus in recent days after accusations it was seeking to hide the extent of the outbreak. As it widens a screening campaign, the number of confirmed cases has jumped sharply, with a 56% increase to 2,336 on Tuesday from a day earlier, Health Minister Saeed Namaki said.

Mr. Namaki, whose deputy is among a score of officials to have contracted the virus, said it had claimed 11 more lives since Monday, bringing the death toll to 77 -- the highest in the world outside China.

Parliament sessions have been suspended after 23 out of 290 lawmakers fell ill with the virus, deputy speaker Abdolreza Mesri was quoted as saying by the Young Journalists Club. ""We advise deputies to cut their contact with people,"" he said. The head of Iran's emergency services has also tested positive, spokesman Mojtaba Khaledi told the Fars news agency, along with two officials on the country's medical council.

It wasn't clear whether the dead include any people in prisons, which have emerged as a flashpoint for transmission in other countries such as China.

Iran's prison population stood at about 240,000 in mid-2019, a social affairs official said.

Prisoners with long sentences or those deemed dangerous to the public aren't among those released, and some of those who were freed had to pay large sums in bail.

Citing the judiciary spokesman, Iran's ambassador to the U.K. said Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is serving a five-year sentence for her conviction on what U.K. officials say are trumped-up charges of spying, is healthy and would be granted furlough on Tuesday or Wednesday to join her family in Tehran. Her family had earlier said Ms. Zaghari-Ratcliffe was unwell and had likely contracted the coronavirus.

It isn't clear whether three Iranian-Americans who are being held will be granted furlough as well. Lawyer Jared Genser, who represents Iranian-American Siamak Namazi, said Mr. Namazi was at risk of contracting the virus after a fellow prisoner on his ward in Evin Prison tested positive.

""Many other sick prisoners who have asked to be tested for coronavirus have had those requests denied,"" Mr. Genser said, describing medical facilities within the prison as rudimentary. He said prisoners had been locked down since Monday in their cells, which each hold at least 10 to 20 people. Until then, they were allowed to circulate within their wards and eat meals together, as well as congregate in the library, exercise facilities and a television lounge.

Iranian authorities couldn't be reached for comment.

Even with prisoners confined to their cells, the risk of transmission remains high because they must pass through a common hallway to use the restroom.

Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. has set aside $40 million to resolve foreign bribery probes centered on its business in China.

The Los Angeles-based multilevel-marketing company is in negotiations with the U.S. Justice Department and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve the investigations, which focus on its compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the company said in its annual report.

Herbalife said it couldn't predict the exact timing of a possible settlement. The provision, which represents the cost the company could incur as a result of any settlement, was recorded in the annual report on Feb. 18.

The sum ""doesn't indicate where we might ultimately land,"" Alex Amezquita, a senior vice president of finance and strategic planning at Herbalife, said during an investor call. ""It is simply an artifact of the discussions that have continued to progress.""

Last year, two former Herbalife executives, both Chinese nationals, were indicted in the U.S. on criminal and civil charges of violating the FCPA, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.

U.S. News: Court Weighs Consumer Agency's Structure

WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court indicated Tuesday that it may curtail the independence of an eight-year-old agency created to protect consumers from abusive financial practices, but showed little inclination to eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau outright, as a California law firm had asked.

The case centers on the bureau's structure: Its director is nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate for a five-year term, but can only be removed for ""inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office."" Conservatives argue that limit impinges on the president's constitutional power over the executive branch, which they say must include authority to remove officials at will.

Lower courts have upheld the CFPB's structure, citing Supreme Court precedents that rejected challenges to other executive-branch agencies that Congress partially insulated from political interventions, including the Federal Trade Commission and, under a now-expired law, independent counsels.

Kannon Shanmugam, representing Seila Law LLC of Orange, Calif., which is under investigation by the agency for abusive telemarketing practices in its debt-relief business, told the justices that such rulings shouldn't be extended to cover the CFPB. He argued the bureau's structure was so flawed that the agency should be shut down and, at minimum, the court void the civil investigative demand the CFPB served on his client.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had a sharp response to the plaintiff's argument that the director's power infringes on the civil liberty of those targeted by the agency's enforcement actions. ""Now whose liberty are we speaking of?"" she said. ""What about the consumers? I mean, Congress passed this law so that the consumers would be better protected against financial fraud.""

The Trump administration refused to defend the CFPB structure, and sent Solicitor General Noel Francisco to argue that the president must be free to fire the director. The Supreme Court then appointed a renowned conservative lawyer, Paul Clement, to defend the structure of the CFPB, an agency conceived by Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. The Democratic-majority House of Representatives, in turn, sent its general counsel to back Mr. Clement's argument.

The outcome, however, may have been presaged in January 2018 when Justice Brett Kavanaugh, then a federal appeals judge, filed a dissent in a separate case upholding the CFPB's configuration. The dissent contended that the for-cause requirement for removing the director marred a constitutional design that helped ""safeguard liberty"" by assigning the president ""authority to supervise, direct, and remove at will subordinate officers in the Executive Branch.""

The remedy, he wrote then, was eliminating the for-cause provision, but otherwise leaving the CFPB intact.

At Tuesday's session, Justice Kavanaugh elaborated on his concerns. ""The problem really reveals itself,"" he said, when a new president is stuck with a holdover CFPB director who may have ""a wildly different conception of consumer financial protection.""

President Trump, who has sought to relax some consumer protections pursued by his predecessor, faced that situation until Obama-appointee Richard Cordray stepped down as CFPB director in November 2017.

The term of the current director, Kathy Kraninger, expires in 2023, meaning she would be running the CFPB well into the next presidential term unless she were to resign or be removed for bad behavior.

The justices focused less on the case's near-term political consequences, though, than their different understandings of the constitutional structure.

Justice Elena Kagan rebutted the focus on removal authority that is central to the conservative theory of the president's exclusive power over the executive branch.

""This is a Constitution that doesn't say anything about removal,"" she said. ""Indeed, it doesn't say anything very much about the structure or organization of the government in general,"" suggesting the framers left that to the elected branches to decide.

U.S. News: States Can Charge Immigrant ID-Theft

A divided Supreme Court on Tuesday boosted the ability of states to prosecute illegal immigrants for identity theft when they provide false Social Security numbers or other information on job applications.

The court, in a 5-4 opinion by Justice Samuel Alito, reinstated convictions obtained by Kansas prosecutors against three restaurant workers for using other people's Social Security numbers on forms given to their employers.

The central question in the case, Kansas v. Garcia, was whether such state prosecutions were barred by a provision of federal immigration law that says any information submitted with federal work-authorization forms can't be used for state law-enforcement purposes.

Justice Alito, writing for a conservative majority, said the answer was no. The mere fact that Kansas law on identity theft overlapped with federal law ""does not even begin to make a case"" that the state's prosecutorial efforts should be pre-empted, he wrote.

""In the present cases, there is certainly no suggestion that the Kansas prosecutions frustrated any federal interests,"" Justice Alito said. Joining him in the majority were Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.

The Trump administration had sided with Kansas in the case, arguing that Congress never meant to carve out an immigration-related exception that would prevent states from enforcing their own identity-theft laws.

In dissent, Justice Stephen Breyer, writing for the court's liberal wing, said U.S. immigration law gave federal authorities the sole responsibility to police fraud committed to obtain eligibility to work.

The law ""reserves to the federal government -- and thus takes from the states -- the power to prosecute people for misrepresenting material information in an effort to convince their employer that they are authorized to work in this country,"" Justice Breyer wrote.

Joining him in dissent were Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
The Coronavirus 'Stimulus'

The Federal Reserve has become the default doctor for whatever ails the U.S. economy, and on Tuesday the financial physician applied what it hopes will be monetary balm for the economic damage from the coronavirus. Financial markets were underwhelmed after the big rally on Monday, which may speak to the limited effect that lower interest rates can have on the supply shock of a pandemic.

The unanimous decision by the Federal Open Market Committee to cut the fed funds rate by 50 basis points to 1%-1.25% was at least bold. Perhaps more significant, the Fed also cut the rate it pays on excess reserves that banks park at the central bank by 50 basis points to 1.1%. This gives banks more of an incentive to put reserves to work in the real economy.

The theory behind the rate cut appears to be that aggressive action is the best way to send a strong message of economic insurance. Perhaps this will help consumers -- whose spending has kept the economy growing despite weak business investment -- maintain confidence in the expansion. Other central banks are also likely to follow the Fed's lead.

Will this make much of an economic difference? Count us skeptical. Financial conditions weren't tight even with a flight to the safety of U.S. Treasurys. The fall in the 10-year note to a historic low of 1% and the recent correction in stocks reflect the expectations of slower growth and thus lower corporate earnings.

But this relates mainly to the damage to global supply chains and expected limits on travel and commerce as the world tries to mitigate the rates of infection. Nobody is going to take that flight to Tokyo because the Fed is suddenly paying less on excess reserves.

The other concern is whether the Fed will have the nerve to raise rates again if the pandemic damage turns out to be less than feared. That won't be easy in an election year, and November is still eight months away. President Trump on Tuesday tweeted a demand that the Fed do more even after its 50-point cut.

The Fed's great mistake after 9/11 was that it kept rates at or near 1% for far too long even after the 2003 tax cut had the economy humming. The seeds of the housing boom and bust were sown. The housing market has begun to take off again in recent months, and in the near term that will help cushion the economy during the coronavirus panic. The trick will be not letting it get carried away into another national price spiral.

This being an election year, the political class is also starting to demand more fiscal ""stimulus."" Mr. Trump tweeted approval for a payroll-tax cut for workers, while Elizabeth Warren bid higher, as she always does, for a $400 billion spending bill. It's only a matter of time before Bernie Sanders raises her, and we start hearing about the fabled ""Keynesian multiplier"" when $1 in new spending yields $1.70 in economic benefit. If Mr. Trump falls for that, he'd be embracing Joe Bidenomics.

We tried the temporary payroll-tax cut idea in the slow growth Obama era, reducing the worker portion of the levy to 4.2% from 6.2% of salary. It took effect in January 2011, but the unemployment rate stayed above 9% for most of the rest of that year.

Temporary tax cuts put more money in peoples' pockets and can give a short-term lift to the GDP statistics. But the growth effect quickly vanishes because it doesn't permanently change the incentive to save and invest. Workers understand their financial circumstances haven't fundamentally changed and act accordingly.

The main redeeming quality of a payroll-tax cut is that it isn't new spending and might offer a refuge for politicians who feel they need to ""do something"" in an election year. But unless it is permanent, it won't be a stimulus for the economy -- and probably not for the election.

Shifting Story: City Halts Order to Shrink a Tower

New York City officials Tuesday halted a judge's order that a developer stop construction and demolish much of a 55-story condominium tower in Manhattan.

The February ruling said the developer of the project known as 200 Amsterdam had to shrink the building because it violated the city's zoning code.

Under the ruling, the building would have to shrink to less than 80,000 square feet and lose perhaps 40 stories in height, said George Janes, a zoning consultant, who worked with opponents of the project.

The ruling sent shock waves through the real-estate industry. Developers worried it could spark challenges to other completed or nearly completed buildings where developers had already spent hundreds of millions of dollars.

New York's real-estate community was already feeling it had become a target of New York City and state lawmakers, who last year imposed higher transfer taxes and passed new tenant protection laws.

In this case, the city came to one developer's defense when city lawyers notified the court that they had filed an appeal in the 200 Amsterdam case. Under state law, when New York City is a defendant, it is entitled to an automatic stay of a ruling against it, lawyers said.

The case will now be considered by an appellate panel and could face a review by the state's highest court, the Court of Appeals.

The ruling by Justice Franc Perry of state Supreme Court in Manhattan overturned a series of decisions by the city's buildings department, as well as a review panel, the Board of Standards and Appeals, that had upheld the building permit issued in 2017 to the developer, SJP Properties.

The 668-foot-tall building, at 200 Amsterdam Ave., has already topped out, and many of the 112 condominiums there are on the market. Construction on the site has been continuing, despite the threat of partial demolition.

""We will continue to vigorously appeal this ruling in partnership with the City and are confident that the facts and justice will prevail,"" said a spokeswoman for SJP Properties.

The real-estate community was quick to criticize the judge's ruling.

""If a specious lawsuit can reverse a nearly complete project, developers and lenders will lose faith that the City's regulatory framework can actually be trusted,"" James Whelan, the president of an industry group, the Real Estate Board of New York.

The case turned on an arcane issue in the zoning code: how city tax lots can be combined into larger zoning lots that allow for the transfer of building rights to a new construction site.

Developers routinely hire zoning consultants to research past advisory opinions and interpretations by the buildings department to find ways to maximize the height and bulk of new buildings -- along with potential profits.

At 200 Amsterdam Ave., the zoning lot was assembled from a collection of partial tax lots left out of other construction projects on the same block. A 1977 buildings-department memo allowed these partial tax lots to be combined into a single building site.

The permit application for the Amsterdam Avenue building shows a spiderlike network of skinny partial lots. The combination allowed the construction of a 370,000-square foot building.

Not About Roe v. Wade

The Supreme Court on Wednesday will hear its first abortion-related case during the Trump Presidency. Cue the consternation. No, the Court's conservatives aren't about to overturn Roe v. Wade. But they do have an opportunity to return to first judicial principles and correct the Court's mistake of four years ago.

Abortion providers in June Medical Services v. Russo are challenging a 2014 Louisiana law that requires them to obtain admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles. The law was intended to root out fly-by-night abortion shops and applies the same state licensing standards to abortion providers as to surgical ambulatory centers.

After Antonin Scalia's death in 2016, a 5-3 majority of the four liberals and Justice Anthony Kennedy struck down a similar Texas law in Hellerstedt. The majority said the safety benefits didn't justify the potential increased burden on women seeking an abortion. Justice Samuel Alito wrote a dissent joined by John Roberts and Clarence Thomas, and now the Court has two new Justices and a full bench.

The Justices agreed to hear the challenge to Louisiana's law and, importantly, they also chose to consider whether abortion providers have legal standing to sue on behalf of women seeking abortions. Third-party standing is a judicial innovation advanced by a 1976 plurality in Singleton in the Burger Court era. This has let providers challenge sundry abortion regulations without having to show injury to a specific woman. In an amicus brief, the state of Texas notes that providers have challenged laws requiring sterilized instruments, a working toilet and caps on ultrasound fees.

As the state of Louisiana argues, the law offers no impediments to women vindicating their abortion rights in court if they believe they have been injured by the law. Many law firms represent low-income women pro bono. Yet women aren't the plaintiffs in this case.

Abortion providers are suing instead to avoid increased compliance burdens. Four of the six doctors employed by clinics challenging the Louisiana law had obtained hospital admitting privileges in the past. Five did not have privileges at the time the law was passed. Three later didn't make a good-faith effort to do so, another retired, and one had no medical-school training to perform abortions. After examining this factual record, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the Louisiana law.

Liberals are warning about a Roe slippery slope if the Court overturns Singleton or Hellerstedt. But a six Justice majority in Kowalski (2004) rejected third-party standing for attorneys seeking to vindicate the legal rights of hypothetical future clients. The same principle should apply to abortion providers.

As Justice Thomas noted in his Hellerstedt dissent, ""When the wrong party litigates a case, we end up resolving disputes that make for bad law."" Dismissing the challenge to the Louisiana law would send a clear message to lower courts and liberals who are trying to extend third-party standing to other controversies.

Many U.S. Cities See Downturn at Hand --- Booming regions mask fiscal weakness in places tethered to shrinking industries

HARVEY, Ill. -- Christopher Clark was elected mayor last year, pledging to cut business taxes and lower water bills. They were popular goals that seemed in reach given that city revenues had been rising almost every year since the recession.

On taking office, Mr. Clark figured out the city's progress had stalled. Property tax collections were down, and businesses were cutting jobs. A fall in city revenue, coupled with growing debt payments, meant there would be no relief from business taxes or water bills.

""We just have to figure out ways to do more with less,"" Mr. Clark said, a mantra surfacing in dozens of U.S. cities.

A decade of growth in the U.S. economy allowed cities to patch fiscal holes left by the financial crisis and recession. A surprising number now see signs of trouble.

The proportion of American cities expecting general-fund revenue to drop more than 3% when the books close on the 2019 fiscal year increased to 27% from 17% in fiscal 2018, when adjusted for inflation. That is one of the findings from a Wall Street Journal analysis of data collected from 478 U.S. municipalities by the National League of Cities, an advocacy group.

The total general-fund revenue reported by these cities -- locales that span the U.S. -- is expected to be lower in fiscal 2019 than in fiscal 2018, adjusted for inflation, the first such dip in seven years. The cities range in population from the low tens of thousands to the millions.

General-fund revenue typically represents dollars not earmarked for a specific purpose, a flexible pot of money to spend on public goods and services.

""It's a big deal when you have this many cities concerned about the near-term future,"" said Matt Fabian, a partner with municipal bond research firm Municipal Market Analytics. ""Maybe they don't hire new police as quickly as they did before. . .Maybe they put off plans to address the big challenges that cities are facing like pensions and climate change.""

American cities are generally doing better than rural communities, buoyed by the U.S. expansion. Yet the boom in such metropolitan areas as Denver, Salt Lake City and Nashville, Tenn., masked fiscal weakness in cities tied to manufacturing and other shrinking industries.

Fallout from the coronavirus disease on the U.S. economy and city budgets is another potential setback. In the past week, New York City has held daily meetings of pension advisers, and California put out a warning to prospective municipal bond investors.

All regions of the U.S. contains cities that are losing fiscal ground, the Journal found. In the West, 29% of cities expected declines of more than 3% in general-fund revenue in fiscal 2019, up from 18% in fiscal 2018. In the South, the proportion of cities reporting a revenue drop went to 20% from 16%, using the same measure; in the Northeast, it went to 31% from 14%.

On the flip side, nearly 60% of U.S. cities reported general-fund revenue increases that outpaced inflation in fiscal 2018. Yet even in this group, expectations are fading: Cities expecting similar growth in fiscal 2019 fell to 53%.

Stagnating or declining revenues are easier to manage for growing cities in the West and South. In New England and the Midwest, many places are struggling with losses of population as well as industry.

Job losses hit hardest in cities that have been barely keeping pace with expenses during the recovery. Tighter household budgets translate into smaller sales-tax allocations. City populations shrink when residents follow jobs out of town, hurting home prices, commerce and property tax collections.

The general-revenue declines struck earliest in the Midwest, where combined inflation-adjusted city revenues fell by 4.3% in the 2018 fiscal year from 2017, the Journal found.

Over the 12 months ending in November, 28 metropolitan areas in the Midwest lost manufacturing jobs, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, including Detroit, Youngstown, Ohio, and Louisville, Ky.

Some losses stem from the shifting global economy and disruptions from the U.S.-China trade war. In Blue Springs, Mo., population 55,000, an auto-parts manufacturer last fall announced it was closing its plant to save costs, a loss of more than 150 local jobs. Operations are moving to Monterrey, Mexico, a company executive said. The city expects general-fund revenue to fall slightly for the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30.

Many cities operating with little fiscal breathing room have been sweating to cover day-to-day city operations under the burden of growing retirement costs and past borrowing.

Bond and pension liabilities owed by roughly 1,000 U.S. cities ballooned nearly 25% to about $500 billion in 2018 compared with 2013, according to an analysis of data from Merritt Research Services. Roughly 50 million Americans live in citiesthat are devoting at least a fifth of annual spending to debt.

As many as 20 of the largest U.S. cities could face either service cuts or tax increases to cover the costs of pensions, retiree health care and interest on bond debt, according to a J.P. Morgan Asset Management study. New Haven, Conn., and Jersey City, N.J., for instance, raised taxes last year to cover such expenses.

Few municipalities are in a deeper hole for their size than Harvey, a city of 24,641 that was founded in 1891 by a lumber tycoon.

Harvey, located about 17 miles south of downtown Chicago, grew into an industrial center, producing car mufflers, farm and mining equipment and military airplane parts. When Mr. Clark, the new mayor, was born a half-century ago, the population was nearly 35,000. Roughly 46% of employed men over 16 worked in manufacturing, according to the 1970 census.

""Everybody had a nice fenced-off yard,"" Mr. Clark recalled of his boyhood neighborhood. ""There was either a Cadillac or a Lincoln in front."" The local Dixie Square Mall had more than 50 stores, including Woolworth and Montgomery Ward.

Mr. Clark drove a forklift before getting a scholarship to law school. He opened his law practice 10 years ago in a former jewelry store downtown.

Factories closed in the 1980s, taking jobs with them. By 1990, nearly 15% of men ages 25 to 54 were unemployed, according to the census. Dixie Square Mall was demolished in 2012 after closing years earlier.

Longtime residents dispersed to other states. For years, they held annual gatherings, called ""Harvey Days,"" in Florida, California and Arizona. The reunions drew thousands of people who had lived, worked or attended high school in Harvey, said Carl Durnavich, who helped organize many of them.

After the financial crisis, city services hit bottom. Broken streetlights went unrepaired, and the fire department was down to one working fire engine. Firefighters who couldn't fit aboard, crammed into a pickup truck, said Ron DeYoung, president of International Association of Fire Fighters Local 471.

The economic recovery finally hit town. One of the city's remaining manufacturers, Sterling Site Access Solutions, which straddles Harvey and the adjacent town of Phoenix, Ill., added roughly 100 jobs between 2013 and 2018. About half were skilled manufacturing positions. The local plant of an international lubricant-maker also expanded its workforce.

In 2018, the city's total private-sector jobs ticked up for the first time in six years, according to a state report. Then, the following year, job numbers fell, eroding most of the gains.

Voters selected Mr. Clark, an outspoken alderman, as mayor. Local employers hailed him as an ally. In the weeks after Mr. Clark's inauguration, residents reported that some alleys had been cleared for the first time in years.

Harvey seemed poised for a turnaround. Signs of distress emerged instead. Property taxes, the city's largest revenue source, fell in the 2018 fiscal year, which ended April 30, 2018. The decline wasn't reported until an audit was completed in October.

Raising rates to make up the losses risked driving away residents and business. Sterling opened a new plant last year, but it was in Texas. Carter Sterling, the company's chief executive, said he decided to expand out of state, in part, because property taxes in Harvey and neighboring Phoenix were too high. Property owners in Harvey pay some of the highest rates in the Chicago metropolitan area, according to an analysis from the Civic Federation, a business-backed watchdog group.

David Abshire, vice president at LB Steel, a local manufacturer, said the city's property tax rates discourage new business, especially with city services falling short. Mr. Clark isn't considering lowering property taxes, he said, because Harvey needs revenue.

Mr. Abshire praised the mayor's work, but he said he was waiting for the city to raze the collapsing building across the street from LB Steel. It makes a poor impression on executives he invites to see his nearly 500,000 square-foot facility. ""We have world-class customers coming here,"" Mr. Abshire said.

City officials said they were working on securing funds to tear down many vacant structures in town.

Decisions by Mr. Clark's predecessor, Eric Kellogg, drove up the city's bond debt to $35 million. Its liability to police and firefighter pension funds grew to $82 million. Use of some of the bond proceeds drew scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which charged the former mayor with fraud after finding the city spent investor money for a hotel project on payroll instead. In a civil settlement with the SEC, Mr. Kellogg agreed to stay out of bond deals. He didn't respond to requests for comment.

The state in 2018 began garnishing millions of dollars in city revenues to refill pension coffers. Like many cities, Harvey had long made smaller-than-needed payments to swelling pension obligations. During Mr. Kellogg's tenure, the city paid nothing into police and fire pension funds for several years, according to city reports.

Harvey has less than 33 cents on hand for every dollar of benefits it has promised retired and working police officers and about 17 cents for every dollar owed retired and working firefighters. One measure of its shrinking fortunes: The city sends paychecks to more retired firefighters than working ones.

Mr. Clark had hoped officials representing police and fire pension funds would agree to accept smaller payments over a longer period, giving the city more leeway for urgent expenses. Fund officials haven't agreed.

Bringing an economic recovery to Harvey will be a huge challenge, said City Councilwoman Shirley Drewenski, a college administrator. Her 3-bedroom house, built by her parents, was valued at $46,580 by the county assessor's office, less than what she paid for her new car.

Mr. Clark is focused on making the most of the revenue he has. The city public works department bought two new snowplows and new mowers. Some streetlights are set to be repaired with a grant for energy-saving LED lighting.

""You know that some things aren't going to happen,"" he said of the city's prospects ""You know that you're going to live a life of hand-me-downs.""

Rate Cuts No Miracle Cure --- Fed can support the economy in the fight against virus but can't lead it

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

Maybe the best thing that can be said about the Federal Reserve's interest-rate cut on Tuesday is that the central bank got it out of the way.

After all, with evidence piling up that the new coronavirus epidemic may represent the most serious threat the economy has faced since the last recession, and with economists repeatedly cutting their economic forecasts, a rate cut by the time of the Fed's meeting scheduled for later this month seemed a done deal.

Investors' apparent disappointment over a statement from Group of Seven finance ministers and central bankers earlier in the day pledging to use ""all appropriate policy tools"" to support growth -- but not offering any concrete steps -- may have underscored the Fed's need to act. The very brief boost that the news gave to risky assets speaks volumes about what it can and can't accomplish.

In acting early, and in cutting its target range by a half a percentage point rather than just a quarter point, the Fed sends the message that it is prepared to do whatever it can to bolster the economy against the effects of the outbreak.

That includes further rate cuts and, if it ends up taking overnight rates down to zero, bond buying, ""forward guidance"" promises to not raise rates for a long time and other kitchen-sink measures in an attempt to stave off a recession.

But the Fed's powers are, in this particular case, muted.

With its target range on overnight rates at 1% to 1.25%, it has a limited amount of rate-cutting firepower. Historically when the Fed has faced a recession, it has cut rates by around 5 percentage points to turn things around. Low long-term interest rates -- the 10-year Treasury now yields just 1% -- makes bond buying less potent as well.

Moreover, monetary policy isn't a good tool to fight economic problems stemming from the coronavirus epidemic.

Lower rates can't fix supply-chain problems faced by companies reliant on Chinese goods, for example, or make nervous consumers book vacations to Miami.

Still, the Fed's easing move is better than nothing and the economy will be better off with them than without them. Investors, and Americans at large, should be comforted that the Fed has their back.

By acting forcefully, the Fed may also help bring home the message that while it can support the economy in the fight against the coronavirus, it can't lead it.

Outage Persists at Robinhood Online Brokerage Firm

An outage that took down popular online brokerage Robinhood Financial LLC extended into a second day Tuesday, locking customers out of the markets on a wild trading day.

Shortly after the opening bell, Robinhood said it was ""experiencing downtime,"" as many of its 10 million users tried and failed to log in for the second day in a row. On Monday, the platform suffered a daylong outage that left customers unable to reap the benefits of a 5.1% rally in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Problems resumed soon after markets opened Tuesday and lasted about two hours. Customers were left on the sidelines when the Federal Reserve cut rates by half a percentage point to combat coronavirus fears, roiling markets.

Robinhood said it ""experienced an issue with a part of our infrastructure"" that allows the company's systems to properly communicate with each other. The company didn't provide any other details about the cause of the outage, though a spokesperson said no customer data, information or funds were lost.

Customers were furious. Some have demanded compensation; others have said they plan to take their money elsewhere. Robinhood said it would work to resolve customer complaints case by case.

Kanak Hyanki was eager to make a few quick trades Tuesday morning after being shut out of the market Monday. The 38-year-old Washington, D.C., resident logged in after he got an email from Robinhood saying service had been restored, yet he was unable to trade.

""If you're losing out on opportunities like this when the whole market is going up and down, then there's no point of the commission-free model,"" Mr. Hyanki said. ""Frankly, if I get a chance, I will take my business elsewhere.""

Robinhood, founded in 2012, has lured millions of users with its commission-free trades, smartphone app and easy-to-use platform. Robinhood's popularity has forced rivals Charles Schwab Corp ., TD Ameritrade Holding Corp . and E*Trade Financial Corp . to eliminate commissions.

Other online brokerages have experienced brief outages during the weeklong market swoon spurred by the worsening coronavirus epidemic. The S&P 500 wiped out $3.6 trillion in market value during the seven-day selloff between the Feb. 19 close and Friday.

Across social-media platforms throughout the past week, customers of TD Ameritrade , Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group have complained about glitches.

For traders who have weathered market ups and downs for years, the outage was reminiscent of a software bug that shut down trading of securities listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market in 2013. Yet unlike the Nasdaq incident, the rest of the world kept trading on Monday and Tuesday.

Aaron Wang, a 32-year-old product manager for a software startup in San Francisco, said he tried logging in ""every few moments"" throughout Monday.

He, like other traders, missed the largest percentage gain that the Dow industrials experienced since March 2009. And they weren't able to trade through Tuesday's volatility in the wake of the Fed's announcement. The Dow swung more than 1,000 points from its high to its low.

Justices Signal Curbing SEC Remedies

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Supreme Court justices Tuesday indicated they may be inclined to rein in how courts and regulators order wrongdoers to return money earned through illegal investment schemes.

In arguments, liberal and conservative justices questioned how they could narrow the remedy without quashing it outright, an alternative they appeared to reject. The Securities and Exchange Commission obtains billions of dollars in such relief every year with the goal of returning it to harmed investors.

Challengers say courts lack express authority from Congress to order the punishment, which is known as disgorgement. The critics also argue the SEC sometimes fails to return the money to investors, making the payments look more like a penalty that would require explicit congressional authority.

Justices on Tuesday appeared to dwell less on those questions and more on how disgorgement should be calculated and where the money should go.

""Would the government have any difficulty with a rule that the money should be returned to investors where feasible?"" asked Justice Neil Gorsuch. The more liberal Justice Elena Kagan posed a similar question, as did other justices.

Arguing the case for the SEC, Deputy Solicitor General Malcolm Stewart later said he didn't object to that approach.

The SEC says it tries to return ill-gotten gains to investors whenever possible. In some cases, such as those alleging bribery of foreign officials or insider trading, there are no obvious victims to return money to, regulators say.

The SEC says courts' authority to require disgorgement comes from their power to enforce corrective measures that make victims whole again.

The dispute before the court relates to an enforcement action taken against Charles Liu and Xin Wang in 2016. The couple was accused of defrauding investors who handed them $26 million to build a cancer-treatment center. Courts ordered Mr. Liu and Ms. Wang to give back that entire sum, not just the profits they were accused of pocketing.

U.S. News -- Analysis: After Rate Cut, Pressure on Fed Persists

By Nick Timiraos

The three main reasons behind the Federal Reserve's interest rate cuts on Tuesday help explain why the central bank is likely to lower rates again.

The Fed hoped to boost public confidence, prevent financial conditions from worsening and cushion the U.S. economy against a global growth downturn.

While the rate cut may help on each of those fronts, the outlook could grow darker in the weeks ahead as the number of U.S. coronavirus cases rises.

The rate cut Tuesday came between the Fed's regularly scheduled policy meetings, illustrating urgency to get ahead of an unfolding shock, even if the underlying nature of the threat isn't economic.

Since 1998, the Fed has cut interest rates six other times between regularly scheduled meetings. Following each of those moves, the Fed has lowered rates again at its next policy meeting.

""For us, what really matters of course is not the epidemiology, but the risk to the economy,"" said Fed Chairman Jerome Powell on Tuesday. ""So we saw a risk to the outlook for the economy and chose to act.""

Any good economic data released in coming weeks can be easily dismissed because they will show how the economy fared prior to the spread of the virus. And more bad news seems likely.

Confidence could falter as health authorities test more widely for the infection, revealing how far it has spread and possibly prompting school closures and remote work arrangements.

""The effects are at a very early stage,"" said Mr. Powell, referring to increasingly negative sentiment from travel and hospitality businesses. ""We expect that will continue. It will probably grow.""

The same dynamic could weigh on financial markets. Measures to contain and mitigate the damage could force companies to lower their earnings forecasts and weigh on stock and corporate-bond markets. The Fed acted Tuesday rather than wait until its March 17-18 meeting to prevent a deeper pullback in credit availability that can occur when lenders reassess borrowers' creditworthiness.

Mr. Powell said the Fed was prepared for a possible increase in corporate defaults or business failures. ""We don't see any of that happening yet. Of course, we are thinking about what we can do, should those things happen,"" he said.

Finally, the U.S. economy faces disrupted supply chains and weaker global economic activity. This downturn could deepen if policy makers abroad aren't able or willing to spur growth. Interest rates are already low and many central banks don't have the wherewithal to reduce them much further.

Countries already experiencing low rates of growth -- such as Italy, Japan and Germany -- are very likely to sink into recession in the coming months. ""We need to be mindful that the impact from the outbreak could be big,"" Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda said Wednesday.

Other central banks with interest rates above zero cut them this week. The Bank of Canada reduced its policy rate by half a percentage point, and the Reserve Bank of Australia reduced its policy rate by one-quarter of a percentage point to a record low of 0.5%.

The Fed's cut took its benchmark rate to a range between 1% and 1.25%, leaving it more room than most other developed-economy central banks to cut further. U.S. rate cuts also make it easier for central banks in emerging markets to lower their borrowing costs without triggering capital flight.

U.S. bond markets may be showing greater signs of hazard ahead. The 10-year Treasury yield fell to new lows on Tuesday and Wednesday. While declines in bond yields in recent weeks have reflected lower inflation expectations and investors seeking havens, most of the most recent drop reflects lower growth expectations, said Roberto Perli, an analyst at research firm Cornerstone Macro.

Over more than 6,000 trading days since 1997, growth expectations reflected in the benchmark 10-year Treasury have fallen by a larger magnitude than they did on Tuesday only 25 times, and most of those were during or before recessions hit, he said.

Lower borrowing costs aren't likely to be effective without broader confidence-building efforts by federal and local authorities to demonstrate they have put in place measures to slow the spread of the new coronavirus.

China Imprisons a Swedish Bookseller

The sentencing of bookseller Gui Minhai to 10 years in Chinese prison is another example of the Chinese Communist Party's willingness to trample on the rule of law and thumb its nose at the world. The Chinese-born Mr. Gui is a Swedish citizen, yet China has forced him to renounce his rights as a foreigner. Sweden's diplomats were barred from observing his trial and have been denied consular access.

Mr. Gui is also a Hong Kong resident, but the city's Chief Executive Carrie Lam has washed her hands of him. Three years ago she said it ""would not be appropriate"" for her to raise his case, or that of others from Hong Kong detained in the mainland, with the Chinese authorities.

Mr. Gui's ordeal began with his apparent kidnapping five years ago in Thailand, where he has a second home. A few months later he appeared on Chinese state television, ""confessing"" involvement in a fatal traffic accident that allegedly occurred more than a decade earlier.

Since then he has mostly been held incommunicado in Ningbo, China. He spent two years in prison, and then a few months in some form of house arrest. Swedish diplomats negotiated his release in 2018, and were with him on a train to Beijing when he was abducted again. Two years later, he has been sentenced, for ""illegally providing intelligence"" to ""overseas"" parties -- a far cry from a traffic accident.

Why was Mr. Gui targeted? In Hong Kong, he ran a publishing house and bookshop that sold books about China's top leaders. Some criticized Chinese politics and others were more salacious and gossipy. These books were banned in China, and so people came to buy them in Hong Kong, where they weren't illegal and still technically aren't. Mr. Gui, together with Lam Wing-kee, Lee Bo, Lu Bo and Zhang Zhiping, ran a thriving business in Causeway Bay. The booksellers disappeared, one by one, in 2015, though all except Mr. Gui were eventually released.

Three days after Mr. Gui's sentencing in Ningbo, three key pro-democracy leaders, media mogul Jimmy Lai and former legislators Lee Cheuk-yan and Yeung Sum, were arrested early in the morning by Hong Kong police on spurious charges of participating in ""illegal assembly."" Unlike Mr. Gui, they were released after a few hours and will appear in court in May with legal representation.

In recent years other foreigners have been detained in China in cruel and illicit ways for political reasons -- British businessman Peter Humphrey, Swedish activist Peter Dahlin, Taiwanese activist Li Ming-che, and Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor. But Gui's case reveals that Beijing is prepared to reach across borders, across diplomatic norms and far beyond legal limits to silence critics.

The world's democracies need to wake up to the danger. Sweden has primary responsibility for securing Mr. Gui's release, but its leverage is limited, and the case threatens the whole international world order.

U.S. News: Rescue Teams Comb Through Tornado Rubble

Search-and-rescue teams continued to look for survivors Wednesday in hard-hit Putnam County, east of Nashville, a day after tornadoes tore across the state and left a trail of ruin.

The twisters killed at least 24 people, according to the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency. Officials had said the death toll was 25 but revised it late Tuesday.

Homes and businesses were reduced to rubble in a swath of middle Tennessee, including Nashville. About 40,000 people still lacked power Wednesday, the agency said.

Eighteen of the deaths occurred in Putnam County, a scenic area about 80 miles east of Nashville known for hiking and fishing. Five of them were children under the age of 13, county Mayor Randy Porter said. As of Wednesday morning, 18 people remained missing in the county, down from about 88 on Tuesday.

""We're hoping that most of those are people that are safe that just haven't let us know that they are,"" Mr. Porter said. ""We're going to be working through that list diligently today to try to make sure that hopefully tonight to have that number down to zero.""

On Wednesday, the county was deploying six-person search-and rescue teams to continue to comb through the rubble of buildings and open expanses littered with debris, said Putnam County Sheriff Eddie Farris at a news briefing. He said the teams still had about 40% of the rubble to go through, in a county where roughly 100 homes were destroyed or severely damaged. They will search the remains of houses, basements and crawl spaces.

""We still could have some people trapped,"" Mr. Porter said.

Another area the teams planned to tackle is a roughly two-dozen-acre marshy field with dense vegetation that lay in the path of the storm, Sheriff Farris said. The task is especially urgent because of the possibility of more inclement weather coming in the next day.

The work of accounting for the missing proved difficult Tuesday because of poor cell service, with cell towers down and the network flooded by people trying to reach one another, Mr. Porter said.

U.S. News: Schumer Is Rebuked by Chief Justice

WASHINGTON -- Chief Justice John Roberts on Wednesday criticized the Senate's top Democrat for saying the Supreme Court's two Trump appointees will ""pay the price"" should they vote against abortion rights.

""I want to tell you, Gorsuch. I want to tell you, Kavanaugh. You have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price!"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) said, speaking of Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh at a rally outside the courthouse while the justices heard arguments over a Louisiana abortion law. ""You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.""

Chief Justice Roberts, who in 2018 spoke out against President Trump's attacks on federal judges, cited Mr. Schumer's remarks in a statement issued after Wednesday's hearing concluded.

""Justices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous. All Members of the Court will continue to do their job, without fear or favor, from whatever quarter,"" the statement said.

Mr. Schumer's spokesman responded: ""Sen. Schumer's comments were a reference to the political price Senate Republicans will pay for putting these justices on the court, and a warning that the justices will unleash a major grass roots movement on the issue of reproductive rights against the decision.""

Supreme Court justices have been in the political cross hairs recently.

During a visit to India last month, the president said Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg should be recused from cases involving him though he didn't threaten the justices. Chief Justice Roberts didn't address the president's remarks.

Mr. Trump, on Twitter Wednesday night, called Mr. Schumer's comments ""a direct & dangerous threat to the U.S. Supreme Court.""

""If a Republican did this, he or she would be arrested, or impeached,"" Mr. Trump wrote. ""Serious action MUST be taken NOW!""

In November 2018, the chief justice rebutted comments from Mr. Trump disparaging federal courts in California.

Banking & Finance: Fed Alters Capital Rules for Big Banks

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve retooled capital rules for the largest U.S. banks, completing one of the biggest changes to the postcrisis rulebook for Wall Street during the Trump administration.

Fed officials on Wednesday said the changes would simplify rules for big banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. without posing risks to the stability of the financial system.

The overhaul ""simplifies the post-crisis capital framework for banks, while maintaining the strong capital requirements that are the hallmark of the framework,"" Fed Vice Chairman for Supervision Randal Quarles said.

The overhaul reflects the latest moves by the Fed to recalibrate oversight of big U.S. lenders. Already, officials have completed separate changes aimed at easing liquidity and capital rules for regional U.S. banks and retooled speculative trading limits for large firms.

Fed governor Lael Brainard, an Obama-era appointee, cast the sole dissenting vote against the plan, saying she believed it would reduce banks' required capital levels and the amount they set aside as a buffer above their regulatory requirements.

She said the plan ""gives a green light for large banks to reduce their capital buffers materially, at a time when payouts have already exceeded earnings for several years on average.""

But Mr. Quarles said the changes would maintain the overall level of capital in the system and modestly increase required capital levels for the largest firms.

His estimates were based on stress-test data from 2013 to 2019, he said.

World News: Epidemic Strains China's Labor Market --- Business slowdowns threaten an already weakened workforce; quit or take less pay

Corrections & Amplifications

In a survey of more than 8,000 working professionals by Chinese recruitment website Zhaopin in mid-February, nearly one-third of respondents said they had observed companies cutting jobs, and 46% said they knew of firms that hadn't paid salaries on time. A World News article Thursday about China's labor market and an accompanying chart incorrectly said that the survey was of more than 8,000 companies and that the responses represented the companies' plans rather than respondents' observations. Also, 19% of respondents said they had observed business failures. The chart incorrectly said 19% of businesses had filed for bankruptcy.

(WSJ March 7, 2020)

(END)

A sharp economic slowdown in China caused by the coronavirus epidemic is putting new pressure on the country's labor market, as businesses struggling to maintain or revive operations resort to pay cuts and layoffs -- or simply shut down.

More job cuts could further depress consumer spending and weaken an economy that is projected to slow significantly or contract in the first quarter.

Jim Huang, chief executive of China-America Commodity Data Analytics, a consulting firm, said he had no choice but to lay off 18 of his 20 employees in Wuhan after it became impossible to run his business in the hard-hit city because of a government quarantine there.

Many of his employees were in other parts of China when the lockdown started and couldn't return, he said, making it difficult to serve clients and keep cash coming in. Mr. Huang, a U.S. citizen, said he is thinking of giving up as he waits out the epidemic in the U.S., where he is buying a farm.

""I believe we have already entered into a recession"" in China, he said. ""If things get better, cool. If not, I'll start a new chapter of my life here.""

Other Chinese companies face similar problems. Uxin Ltd., an online used-car dealer with more than 12,000 employees, began furloughing staff at the beginning of March and paying reduced salaries meant to cover minimum living costs, citing ""difficulty in operations,"" according to a letter sent to some employees.

The company on Monday said it had taken a ""series of measures to quickly adapt business for long-term growth,"" including, with employees' support, ""enacting a temporary workload-based staffing program"" to cut costs. A spokeswoman declined to comment further.

Although companies are pushing to restart factories and ramp up business as fast as possible, quarantines and other government restrictions have made it hard to do so. As of late February, only 30% of China's small and midsize companies had returned to normal operations, according to a survey by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.

A survey of more than 8,000 firms by Chinese recruitment website Zhaopin in mid-February showed that nearly one-thirdplanned to cut jobs, while 46% said they might not be able to pay salaries on time.

Many companies remained hopeful that hiring would snap back sharply once the outbreak is contained.

Disruptions in China's labor productivity and supply chain are expected to scale back foreign investment sharply during the first half of the year, but are unlikely to deter investors' longer-term interest, some analysts say.

Chinese officials have many tools to help stabilize the job market, including ordering local governments to offer unemployment subsidies and extending credit to stressed companies.

""Every effort must be made to prevent massive layoffs, and local governments must help keep employment stable,"" Premier Li Keqiang said in February.

China's urban unemployment rate crept up to 5.2% in December from 4.8% at the beginning of last year. Many economists and scholars have long warned that official unemployment figures are likely to be understated; Chinese officials stand by their numbers.

Even if the epidemic is controlled by the end of March, it could wipe out as many as five million jobs, said Dan Wang, an analyst at the Economist Intelligence Unit.

Miniso, a fast-growing retailer backed by Tencent Holdings Ltd. and private-equity firm Hillhouse Capital Management Inc., told staff in a letter Feb. 21 that while it didn't intend to lay off workers as a humanitarian principle, it planned to slash the next paycheck -- covering January's wages -- by 20% and by at least 30% for February and March.

A former Miniso employee in Guangzhou said his manager told him he could quit and be paid in full for the first two months of the year or stay on staff and accept a forced salary cut and suspension in March.

The 27-year-old former employee said he was under great financial pressure, with an auto loan, 2,000 yuan ($287) in monthly rent, and as much as 3,000 yuan in monthly consumer loans. ""My savings can only sustain for another two months. But looking for a new job hasn't been easy. No companies are open for interviews at the moment.""

A Miniso spokesman said the company revised its initial proposal and paid January salaries in full after receiving feedback from employees. The company had no intention to lay off staff but would ""make proper adjustments"" to salaries for February and March depending on workloads, he added.

OTTAWA -- The Bank of Canada on Wednesday took a cue from the Federal Reserve and cut its benchmark interest rate by a half percentage point in response to mounting worries about the economic toll of the coronavirus epidemic.

It also signaled a willingness to ease further to guard against a deteriorating outlook.

The central bank said the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected more than 10,000 people outside China, represents a material negative shock to the Canadian and global economic outlooks. Its announcement came one day after the Fed's emergency rate cut, also by a half percentage point.

Wednesday's half-percentage-point cut brings the central bank's overnight rate to 1.25%, down from 1.75%.

The Case For Ginsburg To Recuse Herself

President Trump recently lashed out at Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. ""Both should recuse themselves on all Trump, or Trump related, matters!"" he tweeted. He's wrong about Justice Sotomayor but has a point about Justice Ginsburg.

In a lone opinion dissenting from the court's order in Wolf v. Cook County, Justice Sotomayor said she wouldn't stay a lower court's injunction against a Trump immigration policy. ""Claiming one emergency after another,"" she wrote, ""the Government has recently sought stays in an unprecedented number of cases, demanding immediate attention and consuming limited Court resources in each."" (Three other justices dissented without issuing opinions.)

Justice Sotomayor's opinion doesn't disparage Mr. Trump. She criticizes the government's position, but she's harsher on her colleagues in the majority, writing that their ""recent behavior on stay applications has benefited one litigant over all others."" Mr. Trump is the one personalizing a legal dispute, and it would pervert justice if litigants could force judges to remove themselves from cases simply by denouncing them publicly.

Justice Ginsburg is a different case. In public interviews in 2016 she called Candidate Trump a ""faker"" and said: ""I can't imagine what this place would be -- I can't imagine what the country would be -- with Donald Trump as our president."" She even mused about fleeing the country: ""'Now it's time for us to move to New Zealand."" She apologized -- kind of: ""Judges should avoid commenting on a candidate for public office."" She admitted her remarks were ""ill advised,"" and that ""in the future I will be more circumspect.""

The controversy died down, in part because hardly anyone expected Mr. Trump to become president. Now that he's raised the matter again, is he right? The answer seems to be yes. Litigants -- including Mr. Trump -- have a right to appear before judges who have not prejudged the case or the person.

In Cheney v. U.S. District Court (2004), Justice Antonin Scalia rejected a petition to recuse himself from a case involving the vice president, with whom he had gone on a hunting trip. ""While friendship is a ground for recusal of a Justice where the personal fortune or the personal freedom of the friend is at issue, it has traditionally not been a ground for recusal where official action is at issue,"" Scalia wrote.

But Justice Ginsburg's antagonism toward Mr. Trump wasn't personal. In effect she campaigned against him on the grounds that he was unfit for office. The Code of Conduct for Federal Judges directs that no judge should ""publicly endorse or oppose a candidate for public office.""

The code doesn't apply to Supreme Court justices, but they are expected to police their own ethics. In this untraditional era, Mr. Trump has ignored decades of ethical norms. But is it a good idea for Justice Ginsburg to follow his lead?

U.S. News: High Court Tussles Over Abortion Law

WASHINGTON -- Supreme Court justices voiced clashing views in a case that will test whether a more conservative high court will move to narrow access to abortions.

During an hourlong oral argument Wednesday, the court considered a 2014 Louisiana law that requires doctors performing abortions to hold admitting privileges at a hospital no more than 30 miles away.

The Supreme Court, by a 5-3 vote, struck down a similar Texas law in 2016, making Wednesday's case partly a question of whether the justices will reaffirm that precedent -- or begin to relax legal doctrines holding ""undue burdens"" on abortion rights unconstitutional.

Challengers in the case, a Shreveport, La., abortion clinic and two physicians who provide abortions, argued that admitting privileges provide no health or safety benefits. Instead, the rules are aimed at curbing abortion and impose an undue burden on women by leaving the state with just a single clinic, lawyer Julie Rikelman of the Center for Reproductive Rights told the court.

Louisiana's lawyer, state Solicitor General Elizabeth Murrill, said the requirements were intended to protect the health and safety of patients, to vet doctors and to bring abortion regulations in line with those for other outpatient procedures.

No issue before the court is more heated than abortion, and none carries greater political implications, with the next president expected to have one or more vacancies to fill. The Trump administration sent a Justice Department lawyer to argue on behalf of the Louisiana law. As a candidate, President Trump, who has named two justices to the court, predicted his appointees surely would vote to overrule Roe v. Wade, the 1973 opinion establishing abortion rights.

At Wednesday's hearing, justices' questions ran the gamut, from broad ruminations on the significance of precedent to scrutiny of how diligent specific doctors in Louisiana -- each identified by court order as John Doe, to protect them from potential harassment from abortion foes -- were in seeking admitting privileges.

Justice Samuel Alito asked early on why abortion providers even had standing to bring legal claims based on alleged burdens faced by patients -- those the state is trying to protect from abortion providers.

Ms. Rikelman responded that the providers, as those being directly regulated by the state, had proper legal standing

""Well, that's amazing,"" Justice Alito said. Throughout the argument, he returned to the theme that abortion clinics potentially held a conflict of interest with women seeking abortions.

Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg pointed out cases where the court allowed third parties to assert constitutional rights on behalf of their clients. In 1976, for instance, the court struck down an Oklahoma law prohibiting sales of low-alcohol beer to men under 21, but allowing its sale to women over 18.

She and other liberal justices said the admitting-privileges requirement made no sense, since they may be granted or denied for reasons unrelated to physician competence. Complications from abortion are rare, she said; when one requiring hospitalization does arise, it typically is after the patient has returned home and would likely go to the closest hospital.

""I'm prepared to concede that it may not happen all that often,"" said Jeffrey Wall, the U.S. deputy solicitor general who argued in support of Louisiana.

Justice Neil Gorsuch was uncharacteristically silent during the argument.

There were signs that some justices might be seeking a middle ground that could put a reckoning over abortion rights off to another day.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggested the 30-mile limit, rather than admitting privileges by themselves, could be such a place.

""Would this be different if they did something as limited as, for example, 'You have to be admitted somewhere, because being admitted somewhere does further the credentialing benefits"" the state says hospital privileges provide, she asked.

""The medical consensus is clear that in no state do they serve health and safety benefits,"" Ms. Rikelman said.

""It's not just credentialing. It is all of the other factors that also play into it,"" said Louisiana's lawyer, Ms. Murrill. ""It does provide continuity of care. It does address the noncompliance with health and safety regulations"" that she said have characterized some abortion providers.

A decision in Wednesday's case, June Medical Services LLC v. Russo, is expected before July.

World News: ECB Looks At Options To Bolster Economy

FRANKFURT -- The Federal Reserve's surprise rate cut this week puts the European Central Bank under pressure to act as the eurozone's already lethargic economy creaks under the spreading coronavirus epidemic.

There is just one problem: The bank's past efforts to stimulate growth means it doesn't have enough ammunition left to match the U.S. measures. This comes on top of existing doubts about whether monetary policy is the right tool to tackle the fallout from the epidemic.

The outbreak is the first major test for Christine Lagarde, the recently appointed ECB president. An attorney, former French finance minister and former managing director of the International Monetary Fund, she has no prior central banking experience.

While central banks in Australia, Canada, China, Japan and the U.S. have already moved aggressively to support their economies, the ECB has so far held back, even though the bloc's economy has been weak for a year. On Wednesday, a day after the Fed cut rates by 0.5 percentage point, eurozone finance ministers were discussing the region's response to the crisis on a call that was joined by Ms. Lagarde.

The ECB has fewer obvious tools to combat any slowdown than the Fed. The ECB already cut its key interest rate to minus 0.5% last September to support the economy, and restarted a controversial program to purchase 20 billion euros ($22.3 billion) a month of eurozone government and corporate debt.

But the bank still has a broad toolbox compared with many of its peers. It could push negative interest rates further below zero -- although that could put pressure on the region's banks -- and it is considering rolling out targeted loans for banks and businesses hit by the virus.

The ECB, which is likely to announce its next policy steps at a news conference on March 12, could also step up the pace of its 2.6 trillion euro bond-buying program, which could help ease pressure on the region's governments and companies, and support any fiscal stimulus.

ECB officials would prefer eurozone governments to bear more of the burden of supporting the region's economy. Germany and Italy have both announced small fiscal measures in recent days, such as subsidies and tax breaks for companies. But many eurozone governments already have high debt levels, Germany is philosophically opposed to deficit-financed spending, and -- despite years of negotiations -- there is still no central eurozone budget.

Following the conference call Wednesday, eurozone finance ministers said they are willing to step up spending to support growth. ""We are prepared to take further policy action,"" said Mario Centeno, who heads the Eurogroup of finance ministers. ""This includes fiscal measures, where appropriate.""

World News: U.S.-Taliban Deal Faces New Hurdles --- Afghan leader refuses to meet Trump's envoy, as American military conducts new strikes

BEIRUT -- The Trump administration is facing an uphill battle to keep a landmark agreement with the Taliban on track after a resurgence of violence and growing diplomatic strain between Washington and Kabul.

President Ashraf Ghani declined on Wednesday to meet with President Trump's special envoy, who arrived in Kabul in an effort to salvage a four-day old agreement calling for the U.S. military to withdraw from Afghanistan by next fall, an Afghan government official said. The U.S. envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, is expected to instead meet Mr. Ghani's vice president, Amrullah Saleh.

Mr. Ghani's difficulties with the U.S. have been increasing in recent months. The U.S. hasn't recognized his re-election following a disputed presidential contest against Mr. Ghani's rival, Abdullah Abdullah, last year. And Mr. Ghani has refused to cooperate with the Trump administration on its pledge to the Taliban to secure release of up to 5,000 insurgents held by the Afghan government.

Under the deal, the prisoner release must precede any talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government. Those talks are set to start Tuesday, but a delay is likely.

On Wednesday the U.S. military conducted an airstrike against the Taliban in defense of Afghan forces, the first since the U.S. signed a deal with the militant group to map out an end to 18 years of war, America's longest.

The Taliban fighters were targeting an Afghan security checkpoint in southern Afghanistan, U.S. officials said.

Hours before the U.S. airstrike, Mr. Trump said he had a ""good talk"" with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Taliban co-founder who signed the deal in Doha, Qatar.

The agreement doesn't explicitly call for an immediate reduction in violence. However, the U.S. military accused the Taliban of ""squandering"" its chance to end the war by stepping up its attacks against Afghan security forces after the deal was signed in Qatar. The Taliban previously had agreed to a seven-day reduction in violence as a show of good faith before the deal was signed.

The Taliban spokesman in Doha said the group was committed to implementing the deal and moving toward a reduction in violence.

""The other side must also remove the barriers to the implementation of all parts of the Agreement,"" Suhail Shaheen said on Twitter.

U.S. officials had hoped the Taliban would agree to informally extend the seven-day truce, but the Taliban declared its plans to resume attacks on Afghan security forces. The deal stipulates only that the Taliban must include a cease-fire as an agenda item when Afghan talks begin.

Since the signing of the deal Saturday, Taliban forces have carried out at least 76 attacks in nearly three quarters of the country's provinces, according to the country's National Security Council.

U.S. News: Appeals Court Narrows Asylum Policy Ruling

A federal appeals court for now agreed to narrow the effect of its recent ruling that blocked a Trump administration policy of returning immigrants at the southern U.S. border to Mexico while their requests for asylum are considered.

The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco, in an order issued Wednesday, said it ruled correctly last week that the administration's ""Remain in Mexico"" policy is unlawful.

But the court acknowledged the ""intense and active controversy"" over nationwide injunctions against administration policies and said it would limit its ruling for now to the two border states within its jurisdiction: Arizona and California.

That means the Trump administration could continue enforcing the policy in the border states of New Mexico and Texas for months while it mounts a Supreme Court appeal.

The Ninth Circuit also said none of its ruling would go into effect until March 12, giving the Trump administration a week to ask the Supreme Court for an emergency stay to keep the policy in place everywhere for the time being.

The ""remain in Mexico"" policy, formally called the Migrant Protection Protocols, made its debut in January 2019 as the Trump administration sought alternatives to releasing families seeking asylum into the U.S., where they were permitted to live for months, and often years, as their cases made their way through backlogged immigration courts.

The government has sent more than 60,000 migrants seeking asylum back across the border in the past year, where they were required to wait in violent Mexican border cities for months for U.S. court dates.

Many migrants who have been returned to Mexico -- about half, according to recent data -- simply drop their claims before they are decided.

With the Ninth Circuit saying it will begin blocking the Trump policy in Arizona and California, the court order could inadvertently create a new magnet for migrants to cross the border there, rather than in South Texas, which is a shorter trip from Central America.

Immigration officials launched the policy in Arizona last year after word spread that migrants arrested crossing the border near Nogales, Ariz., weren't being sent back to Mexico.

Fearful Investors Pile Into Germany's Bunds

As the economic fallout from the coronavirus spreads across Europe, the safest haven available to investors is in chronically short supply.

German government bonds, known as bunds, are the benchmark safe asset in the eurozone, playing a similar role to Treasurys in the U.S. They are what investors compare all other returns against and the thing everyone wants to own when markets are in turmoil.

Because Germany issues very little debt, and because a chunk of the bond supply is locked up by European Central Bank buying, when investors clamor for bunds, yields fall quickly.

The 10-year bund traded as low as minus 0.69% on Thursday, down from minus 0.39% on Feb. 18 when the coronavirus selloff intensified in Europe, according to Tradeweb. The downward trajectory in bund yields has been faster than other European government bonds, sliding more in percentage-point terms than both the French and Dutch equivalents.

""When there is a proper dislocation in the market, German bunds continue to be the safe haven in Europe. Even with negative yields, we still see the flight to quality,"""" said Iain Stealey, international chief investment officer for fixed income at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.

Driving the yields lower are strong signals from the ECB that it will follow the Federal Reserve's surprise rate cuts with action of its own next week. It is scheduled to meet on Thursday. ECB President Christine Lagarde said Monday that the bank is ready to take ""appropriate and targeted measures"""" in response to the epidemic and its impact on the economy.

That could include lowering the already negative rate the ECB charges banks on deposits or increasing the size of its bond-purchase program.

""We're expecting something more targeted, which could mean expansion"" of quantitative easing, said Cathal Kennedy, European economist at RBC Capital Markets. That would likely mean the ECB buying more government and corporate debt.

Germany's penchant for frugality means it runs a budget surplus and issues very little debt. Berlin had a total of 1.58 trillion euros ($1.76 trillion) of outstanding debt securities in January. That is compared with more than $16 trillion from the U.S. and $10 trillion in Japan.

The plunge in bund yields seems to reflect skepticism that Germany will change its tune and increase that supply of debt despite yields on its debt of all maturities typically being in negative territory.

""How bad does the European economy have to get before Germany wants to do that, that's the big question,"" Mr. Stealey said. ""That's really what we'll be focusing on.""

Also keeping supply tight: The ECB currently owns 30% of German government debt, which includes sovereign, regional and municipal bonds, according to Societe Generale.

MANSION --- The Market: The Rapid Growth Of the Mega-Rich --- The number of people worth $30 million or more is way up

New York City condo developers are facing a supply overhang and tax changes resulting in greater costs for buyers. But there is one bright spot: an uptick in the number of people around the world who can afford their seven-digit apartments.

Approximately 31,000 ultra-high-net-worth people were minted in 2019, an annual growth rate of 6% and more than three people per hour, according to a new report by U.K.-based real-estate firm Knight Frank and New York brokerage Douglas Elliman. The report defined ultra-high-net-worth individuals as people with a net worth of $30 million or more. The previous year saw a rate of just 4%.

North America created the most of this cohort, adding 13,911 in 2019, compared with 4,682 in Europe. Asia also saw its population increase dramatically over the past year, adding 11,788 such individuals, according to the report.

The trend is set to continue. The number of ultra-high-net-worth individuals around the world is forecast to grow by about 27% in the next five years, according to the report. That means there will be about 650,000 people around the world with at least $30 million by 2024.

Countries with the fastest-growing population of these individuals include India, which is slated to see a 73% increase by 2024, as well as Egypt, Vietnam and China.

Luxury New York real-estate agent Leonard Steinberg of Compass said these are the kind of numbers that drive real-estate marketers in cities like New York.

""The billionaire class is a small group of people and they're exceedingly over exposed,"" he said. ""The lesser known rich don't get nearly as much press. Real-estate marketers are paying close attention to where they are,"" he said.

A search of website StreetEasy shows that there are about 155 listings in Manhattan priced at $10 million or more, though those numbers don't include all new development inventory.

The report also points to a shift in how ultra-high-net-worth individuals are spending their money, said Liam Bailey, global head of research at Knight Frank. Amid concerns of a global economic slowdown, they are shifting investing strategies in 2020, eschewing equities for private-equity investments, cash, gold and real estate.

Roughly 43% of the respondents in the survey of 620 wealth advisers, who manage about $3.3 trillion on behalf of these individuals, said they would increase their real-estate exposure in 2020, the data shows. Meanwhile, roughly 38% said they planned to cut their allocations in equities.

Predictions about small groups aren't an exact science. Knight Frank also has an economic interest in selling high-end homes.

For buyers in Asia particularly, the U.S. is still the top destination for residential real estate outside their home countries, according to an attitudes survey cited in the report.

""The appeal of holding a dollar-denominated asset in the world's biggest economy is likely to increase on the back of 2019's three rate cuts, with some buyers viewing the lull in the run up to the presidential election as a potential opportunity,"" the report said.

However, it was cities in Europe and Asia that topped Knight Frank's pricing index in 2019. Germany's Frankfurt topped the list of fastest-growing cities in terms of real-estate prices, posting a 10.3% gain in 2019, thanks in part to rock-bottom interest rates.

In Asia, the city of Taipei posted a gain of 8.9%.

Vancouver was the weakest performer, with a decline of 8.3%. Once a popular market with Chinese buyers, the market has been affected by a torrent of regulations since 2016, including a 20% foreign-buyer tax.

New York also instituted a mansion tax, which charges buyers a larger one-time tax payment at the time of closing. It increases incrementally with purchase prices of $2 million or more, topping out at 3.9% for properties sold for $25 million or more.

Business News: Outbreak Crisis Bankrupts Airline --- British regional carrier Flybe grounds flights, enters protection as bookings plunge

The coronavirus outbreak claimed U.K. regional airline carrier Flybe, which entered bankruptcy administration and forced the cancellation of dozens of flights across the country.

The carrier, owned by a consortium including Britain's Virgin Atlantic, has struggled financially for months -- long before the widespread emergence of the virus outbreak. Its shareholders infused cash into it as recently as January, and the British government agreed to extend the payment of air-passenger taxes to help lessen strain.

But a bigger, hoped-for government rescue package didn't materialize, and a recent virus-related plunge in bookings forced Flybe's owners to balk at putting any more money in. A spokesman for Virgin said, ""the impact of Covid-19 on Flybe's trading means that the consortium can no longer commit to continued financial support.""

All flights by Flybe -- which flies mostly regional routes across the U.K., including to many of its less well-served regions -- and sister carrier Stobart Air were grounded early Thursday, stranding passengers.

Virgin, which is 49% owned by Delta Air Lines Inc., said it was looking at options to support the airline's roughly 2,400 staff. Last year, Flybe accounted for about 38% of U.K. domestic flights, according to the European Regions Airline Association. It had operated 139 routes, serving eight countries from 56 airports. It is a big player in some of Britain's second-tier cities, like Manchester and Birmingham, in England, and Aberdeen, Scotland.

Airlines around the world have been hammered by the virus outbreak. Travelers are canceling flights and not booking new ones. Several large companies, including Nestle SA, are forbidding staff to embark on business travel, one of the biggest profit drivers for the industry.

The International Air Transport Association forecast Thursday that the virus could reduce passenger revenue world-wide by between $63 billion and $113 billion this year -- a dramatic step up from the trade group's last estimate, in February, of just under $30 billion.

Until recently, most of the industry carnage was contained in China, the epicenter of the virus outbreak. Airlines have grounded planes and taken draconian cost-cutting measures. Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd., Hong Kong's flag carrier, has required all staff to take three weeks' unpaid leave.

The pain has now spilled over into Europe and is washing up on U.S. shores, too. Deutsche Lufthansa AG, Germany's flagship, announced a total of 7,100 European flight cancellations for the month of March. Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, the budget trans-Atlantic carrier, said Thursday it was canceling 22 flights between Europe and the U.S.

Flight bookings to Europe fell 79% compared with the same period a year earlier, according to ForwardKeys, which tracks travel data.

""We've taken a big hit,"" said Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair Holdings PLC, the Dublin-based budget carrier, speaking at an industry conference in Brussels this week. ""What I foresee is very deflated bookings for the next 2-3 weeks."" Beyond that, he said, bookings will depend on how the virus spreads.

Punctuating the geographic spread of the industry pressure, United Airlines Holdings Inc., which has already slashed international flights, said late Wednesday it would cut domestic flights, too.

HNA Group Co., the owner of Chinese carrier Hainan Airlines, is another victim of the epidemic, though so far has managed to keep its airline flying. The group asked for a government takeover.

U.S. News: Tech Giants Vow Help Against Child Exploitation

Representatives from law enforcement and the technology industry pledged to step up their fight against child sexual abuse on the internet, but they remained at odds over government concerns about misuses of the encryption technology deployed by some companies.

Attorney General William Barr on Thursday said six major technology companies had agreed to a set of voluntary principles that would guide their approach to fighting online sexual exploitation of children.

The technology companies have agreed to a series of high-level principles that will govern the way they police online content -- ideas such as focusing their efforts on areas that have been difficult to monitor, such as live streaming, and taking into account solutions proposed by victims. Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Microsoft Corp., Snap Inc. and Twitter Inc., as well as the online gaming hub Roblox Corp., have been developing these principles since July, the Justice Department said.

But Mr. Barr and some of the U.S.'s closest international intelligence-sharing partners -- a group known as the Five Eyes -- remain concerned that encryption technology, particularly Facebook's plans to add end-to-end messaging encryption, could leave them in the dark. Some members of that group last year voiced their concerns about the spreading private-sector use of such technology.

""Encryption remains the elephant in the room,"" James Brokenshire, a minister with the U.K.'s Home Office, said Thursday in Washington. ""Last year, Facebook identified around 12 million incidents of child sexual exploitation abuse on Messenger -- something that I absolutely commend them for doing -- yet plans to encrypt this service would leave you blind to the same crimes.""

Facebook, meanwhile, reiterated its concern that any government efforts to roll back encryption would undermine the security of its products.""We believe companies and governments can work together to keep children safe online while still protecting people's privacy and continuing to secure their messages with encryption,"" a company spokesman said via email.

Mr. Barr also rebuked Apple Inc. less than two months ago for its encryption and other digital-security measures when he escalated pressure on the company to open a pair of iPhones belonging to an aviation student from Saudi Arabia who killed three people at a Florida Navy base late last year.

Mr. Barr has shown a willingness to confront tech companies in a way that has concerned even some like-minded Federal Bureau of Investigation officials who fear it could hurt the relationships they have built with Silicon Valley.

Yet Mr. Barr, speaking at the media event Thursday where officials declined to answer questions, appeared to soften his tone. He again lamented suspects' ability to communicate through ""virtually unbreakable encryption,"" saying ""predators' supposed privacy interests should not outweigh our children's privacy and security; there's too much at stake."" But, he added that he was heartened that companies had signed onto the principles.

Four years ago, the Justice Department launched a legal fight against Apple, looking to compel the iPhone maker into granting it access to the mobile phone used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif., terror suspects. Government officials ultimately backed down after a private firm found a way to access the phone.

Apple wasn't named in Thursday's announcement, but a company spokesman said it endorses the principles.

In addition to Mr. Barr's statements,Sens. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) and Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.) have proposed legislation that could pressure tech companies into providing law-enforcement access to these systems.

Apple, like Facebook, has said any system that would grant such access would undermine the security of their products and create opportunities for criminals and authoritarian governments to improperly access user data.

Potomac Watch
Schumer and the War on Judges

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's verbal threats against two Supreme Court justices aren't surprising, in light of three years of ""resistance"" hostility to Trump judicial picks. What is remarkable is that Democratic leaders continue to take such a losing approach to an issue that will be central to the 2020 election.

Mr. Schumer did hit a new low Wednesday, when he stood outside the Supreme Court and rallied a mob of abortion-rights activists by vowing that Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch would ""pay the price"" for releasing ""the whirlwind."" ""You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions,"" he thundered. When even liberal legal scholar Larry Tribe called the remarks ""inexcusable,"" Mr. Schumer made a halfhearted attempt to walk them back, saying he ""shouldn't have used the words.""

Yet the Schumer threats are of a piece with today's standard Democratic approach to the court: Attack and intimidate. Of everything Democrats lost to Donald Trump in 2016, the forfeiture of the judicial branch still grates the most. They remain furious that Obama nominee Merrick Garland never got his Supreme Court robe. They are livid that the Kavanaugh confirmation provided the high court its first solid conservative majority in decades. They are outraged that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has confirmed nearly 200 Trump judges, including 51 on the appellate courts.

Unable to stop the appointments, Democrats have shifted to threatening the appointees. These have included attacks on individual judges. The hit job in 2018 on Judge Kavanaugh was about defeating his nomination, or at least cowing him into more liberal rulings. Since his confirmation, Democrats have continued to hold the threat of impeachment over his head, again in the hope of intimidating him into taking their side on key cases.

Or take Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's sucker punch of Chief Justice John Roberts during the Trump impeachment trial, in which she forced him to read aloud her question challenging his ""legitimacy."" Even Justice Sonia Sotomayor got in on the action, with a recent opinion that outrageously suggested her fellow conservative justices were biased in favor of Mr. Trump.

Then there are the ceaseless threats to the institution. Rhode Island's Sheldon Whitehouse and four other senators last year filed a friend-of-the-court brief warning of political consequences if the justices didn't side with them against gun rights. ""The Supreme Court is not well,"" the brief asserted. ""Perhaps the court can heal itself before the public demands it be 'restructured in order to reduce the influence of politics.'""

Liberal proposals to remake the judicial branch are a dime a hundred. Some propose packing the Supreme Court by increasing its size and creating new vacancies for a Democratic president and Senate to fill. Others demand term limits, though that would require a constitutional amendment. Yet others propose stripping or curtailing the judicial branch's authority to review entire swaths of legislation.

Mr. McConnell, in a Thursday floor speech rebuking Mr. Schumer, likened the left's message to a gangster's intimidation: ""That's some nice judicial independence you got over there. It'd be a shame if something happened to it.""

The attacks and threats thrill the progressive base, but they are about as politically wise as impeachment. The most important step Mr. Trump took on his path to the presidency was releasing his list of proposed replacements for the late Justice Antonin Scalia. That inventory of impressive jurists not only reassured conservatives but motivated them to vote.

Mr. Trump will make sure his court successes are at the center of his re-election campaign. He will again highlight the stakes, especially for the Supreme Court. And here are Democrats making his case more powerful by promising not only to put an end to Trump picks, but to undo his court victories to date. Talk about a Republican turnout motivator.

Democratic court radicalism also has the potential to turn off centrist voters. This week saw Super Tuesday voters offer a stark rebuke to Bernie Sanders's burn-it-down politics. (Mr. Sanders's proposal is to transfer the high court's conservatives to a different court and replace them with his own picks.) A 2019 Rasmussen poll found only 27% of Americans open to court packing. Even as American faith plummets in most government institutions, the public retains broad support for the Supreme Court. They don't appreciate the attacks.

Instead of trashing the court, maybe Democrats could make their own lists of Supreme Court picks. They'll need to do something, because the court issue is coming at them like a freight train. And all they've got is venom.

Boeing, Families Forge Tense Ties In Year After Crash --- Victims' kin in Ethiopia want a memorial, so they must work with plane maker, airline

GARA BUKAN, Ethiopia -- In the remote fields where an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 MAX crashed a year ago, the ground is still littered with shards of metal, bolts and colorful bunches of wires that once kept Flight 302 aloft. A solitary hiking boot protrudes from the ground.

""It's a graveyard,"" said Nadia Milleron, whose daughter Samya Rose Stumo died there on March 10. Ms. Milleron received her daughter's remains in 122 formaldehyde-soaked bundles with labels like ""arm,"" or ""hair."" Some relatives didn't even get that much.

The grieving families of the 157 dead want to mark that ground with a permanent memorial and a paved road to reach it. They envision a hospital or school to benefit local people who helped collect pieces of the wreckage and remains. Many will travel on Boeing Co.'s dime to Addis Ababa to commemorate the first anniversary of the crash next week.

The result is that families are caught in a grim partnership with the two companies that have been the source of their pain.

Nobody involved has a playbook to follow. The families, spread over some three dozen countries, are still reeling from their losses. Ethiopian Airlines has never had to deal with a tragedy of this magnitude, and Boeing has little experience working directly with families of crash victims.

Boeing has been slow to acknowledge the role its design and engineering mistakes played in the Ethiopian disaster and the similar accident off the coast of Indonesia less than five months earlier. Families have filed more than a hundred lawsuits accusing Boeing of disregarding human lives and of putting profits over safety when it developed the MAX and when it opted not to ground the plane after the first crash.

In court filings, Boeing has denied the allegations. ""Safety is at the core of everything we do at Boeing,"" a spokesperson said. ""We do not trade safety for lower cost, because without safety and quality, we don't have a business.""

The company has engaged victim-compensation attorney Kenneth Feinberg to disburse $50 million in direct payments to families of the 346 people who died in the two crashes, and to oversee the distribution of another $50 million to assist communities affected by the crashes. The memorial discussions are taking place apart from this.

To make any of their hopes for a crash site a reality, the families need Boeing's money and the airline's cooperation. Accepting either means having their lives inextricably bound to these companies for possibly years to come.

""It's not easy to sit with them at a table and just start talking like nothing has happened,"" said Samira Eissa, whose 49-year-old father died in the crash. Ms. Eissa, 22, has been juggling planning meetings for the anniversary with her studies in Germany. ""But as I see it, those are the people who put harm to us . . . so those are the ones who should be paying for that damage.""

A planning session to commemorate the anniversary of the crash took place in late January in Ethiopian Airlines' Addis Ababa headquarters. The conference room looked out onto the airport where the doomed flight originated.

As the date drew near, Emmy Auma Odero was afraid of what she might do when she came face-to-face with representatives from Boeing and the airline. Her sister Immaculate Achieng Odero was 29 when she died in the crash, leaving behind a 3-year-old daughter.

""I talked to my mom. I told her pray for me, because I don't know how I'm going to face these people -- look them in the eye, sit across from them,"" she said. ""I was very, very angry. And I'm still angry.""

Nine volunteers who lost siblings, parents and others spent hours with executives from Boeing's government arm and a handful of Ethiopian Airlines officials.

Some relatives were upset about Ethiopian's proposal to hold an international design competition for a physical monument at the site of the crash, including prize money and a panel of professional judges. The families said the process Ethiopian had outlined seemed rushed -- as if the carrier was trying to put the incident behind it. They wanted to have more to say about the memorial's design, and argued they weren't being given enough time to weigh in.

At the meeting, Boeing's Tim Keating, executive vice president of government operations, stepped in, according to people in attendance, telling the Ethiopian executives that their plans were moving too quickly for many of the families.

Ethiopian Airlines executives acknowledged that communications between the airline and the families of the victims were shaky at first. ""Ours is a balancing act. I think maybe at the beginning we should have seen that there were going to be challenges,"" said Kagnew Fisseha, vice president of holidays and digital sales for the airline, who is acting as a spokesman for Ethiopian. The memorial plans were paused.

Even logistical meetings have turned emotional, said Allan Jaboma, a Kenyan who lost his sister, who had been on her way home from a pediatric oncology conference. Nearly everyone cried at the first conference call of the committee working on the memorial, he said.

""It's nagging and we can't move on. Because we have to see all this through,"" Mr. Jaboma said.

As the anniversary looms, the parties have clashed over travel arrangements. Some families pushed back against Ethiopian's initial proposal to include just two guests per victim. Boeing agreed to cover travel costs for four. Some have said they would rather not travel to the event on Ethiopian Airlines, or that they want to avoid Boeing jets.

""It's going to be the hardest trip I've ever taken,"" Ms. Eissa said.

A person familiar with Boeing's planning said the company was able to accommodate many of the requests.

Boeing representatives who have worked most closely with the families are making sure other company employees are aware of the crash's emotional toll. ""We're telling these stories across Boeing, we're letting [Boeing employees] know, and that there are consequences. That this is a big deal,"" said Mr. Keating, who also oversees Boeing's charitable activities.

Some of the sharpest conflicts have been with Ethiopian Airlines. Many didn't receive remains for seven months and fault the airline for being slow to sweep the site again when summer rains brought additional bones to the surface.

Last fall, Ethiopian filled in the crater at the site of the plane's impact, burying coffins containing the remains too small to be identified. Families were notified a day or two in advance -- almost nobody was able to make the trip in time to witness what they considered to have been a funeral for the dead.

""We want to know every step,"" said Konjit Shafi, whose 31-year-old brother Sintayehu -- the family's primary breadwinner -- died in the crash while on his way to a recertification course in Nairobi for his job at an automotive company. ""I need them to be closer to the families than this and update us more often.""

Ethiopian's Mr. Fisseha said the victims' remains were identified as quickly as possible through DNA tests. ""The identification process was really difficult,"" he said.

Roland Rehhorn and Joan Vincent, whose 24-year-old daughter Angela Rehhorn died in the crash on her way to attend a United Nations meeting on the environment, traveled from their home in Ontario to Washington last year to meet with Boeing executives, including then-CEO Dennis Muilenburg.

""I remember sitting in that room with Dennis Muilenburg, and I remember thinking, 'this is really weird,'"" Ms. Vincent said. ""I was in conflict sitting there,"" she said.

""It's kind of confusing,"" Mr. Rehhorn said. ""You're kind of litigating against them, but yet they're there to help.""

At the meeting in Washington, family members held enlarged photos of their dead relatives. Paul Njoroge, a Canadian who lost his wife, three young children, and his mother-in-law, displayed only pictures of their caskets. ""I told them that the faces of my wife and children did not matter to them,"" Mr. Njoroge said. ""I said they should look at those coffins and think about the pain, anguish and devastation they caused me.""

Families of victims are hoping to use a portion of the $50 million Boeing has set aside for community assistance to build a hospital or high school and to improve access to drinking water or electricity for the benefit of local residents near the crash site.

Demoze Wodajo, the top government official for the district, said the community is starting to worry about the delays. ""We have been discussing, but Ethiopian is not confirming back whether projects will be implemented or not,"" he said. ""Ethiopian always responds that they will consider the projects.""

Though they have agreed to work together for now, the families remain at odds with Boeing. Many relatives have said they want to keep the MAX from ever flying again. Some have met privately with top officials at aviation regulators in the U.S., Canada and Europe to push for stricter scrutiny of the plane. They have blasted Boeing's current and former leaders as culpable for the crashes.

Boeing has already removed Mr. Muilenburg, who led the company during the crashes, and has taken other steps aimed at strengthening its engineering and safety processes. Still, some family members have publicly called for new Chief Executive David Calhoun or other board members to resign.

Several remain skeptical of the company's motives. ""Anything being done in honor of our loved ones should not be done as a way for corporations to earn their community badge or rehabilitate their reputation,"" said Zipporah Kuria of the U.K., whose father died in the crash.

Boeing executives involved in the company's efforts say they aren't trying to score public-relations points, but to ensure the families continue to have a role.

""Sometimes they're angry with us and that's OK, we accept that,"" said Jennifer Lowe, another Boeing executive who has been working with the families.

World News: Epidemic Sparks Scrutiny Of Labs Handling Pathogens

SHANGHAI -- Scientists at a specialized Wuhan laboratory have been at the forefront of China's response to its continuing coronavirus epidemic, but are drawing attention to risks associated with the expanding global study of deadly pathogens.

The Wuhan Institute of Virology contributed to China's fast identification this year of the outbreak's source as a previously unknown coronavirus. It was a monumental achievement for a government that aims to rival the West in high technology, including bioscience.

Yet, the institute's location at ground zero of the most infectious epidemic in China's modern history has also made it a target for peddlers of alternate theories that humans first contracted the virus as the result of an accident of some kind at the laboratory. Leading scientists in China and internationally have dismissed such views, saying the virus likely originated in wildlife, perhaps bats, before spreading to humans, possibly through a food market in Wuhan.

But biosafety experts agree that as more countries handle deadly and exotic microbes at containment labs like the one in Wuhan, risks of accidents or terrorism are growing. In a rush to open labs that scientists say can appear motivated by national pride, governments on every major continent now handle dangerous pathogens that were once confined to a handful of institutions like the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""The release of pathogenic microorganisms from high-containment laboratories, such as the pandemic CoV-19, seems more likely in countries without current, historically solidified standards or legislation,"" says Thomas Binz, who leads biosafety efforts at Switzerland's Federal Office of Public Health.

The showpiece of Wuhan's virology institute is a facility opened in 2017 as the most secure of its kind: Biosafety Level 4, or BSL-4, which means maximum containment of the kind of pathogens that are deadliest to humans. ""Infections caused by these microbes are frequently fatal and without treatment or vaccines,"" according to a CDC description of what belongs in such a lab.

While noting that no international rules govern biosafety, the World Health Organization about two years ago counted 54 high-containment labs in 24 countries. Its list included 31 operational BSL-4s, plus 12 more in some stage of construction, with China, Ivory Coast, Saudi Arabia and South Korea described as new entrants.

Modern BSL-4 labs, which often have a national-defense function and work with a nation's military, feature sealed rooms, special ventilation and rigid procedures for scientists, who work in protective bubble suits usually seen only in Hollywood thrillers.

The one in Wuhan, China's first to handle human pathogens, was engineered by a military contractor for the People's Liberation Army and certified domestically. It has studied HIV, Ebola and now Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus discovered in the city.

James W. Le Duc, a former CDC biosafety expert who runs a biocontainment facility at the University of Texas in Galveston, says two of the Wuhan institute's scientists trained with him, and his engineering team visited China to advise ""how to drive the place and keep it safe.""

Despite careful protocols, accidents happen. The CDC says that in 2014, tubes being used in a study of live Ebola virus in its Atlanta BSL-4 facility got mixed up and the wrong ones were mistakenly transferred to a less-secure lab, though no one got sick.

The CDC says it developed the world's first BSL-4 facility in a truck trailer in 1967 in response to the emergence of Marburg virus, a close cousin of Ebola. Among the U.S.'s 10 BSL-4 labs designed to handle microbes harmful to humans is the CDC's biggest yet, a $480 million, 95,000-square-foot, high-containment lab in Atlanta.

East is East: Hindu Supremacism Turns Deadly in Delhi

Deadly riots in Delhi last month killed at least 44 people, most of them Muslim, and raised the prospect of heightened conflict between India's 966 million Hindu majority and its 172 million Muslims. But the violence also highlights another domestic fissure: between Hindus who back religious pluralism and their coreligionists who are bent on asserting their supremacy in what they see as their homeland.

This isn't a new divide, though its recent deepening could threaten India's stability. For close to 100 years Hindus have faced a choice between the inclusiveness of Mahatma Gandhi (1869-1948) and the tribal appeal of Hindu nationalism's chief ideologue, Vinayak Savarkar (1883-1966). Savarkar espoused the idea that India belongs to followers of so-called Indic faiths, that is, those that originated in the subcontinent. This casts Muslims and Christians as inherently at odds with Indianness, no matter how long they or their ancestors have lived on Indian soil.

In Savarkar's view, Muslim and Christian Indians form a kind of fifth column because their holy lands are not the same as their fatherland. By contrast, both Gandhi and India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, espoused civic nationalism, which views all Indians as equal regardless of their faith.

Long consigned to the margins of national life, Savarkar's ideas find many takers in India today, particularly in the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party. But though the idea of civilizational conflict with the Abrahamic faiths may appeal to die-hard Hindu nationalists, it's not clear that it offers a viable way to govern a country in which 1 in 5 Indians is not Hindu.

The recent violence in Delhi -- the worst outbreak in the city since anti-Sikh riots killed more than 3,000 people in 1984 -- is a manifestation of this ideological schism. Muslims are participants in the debate, and bore the brunt of the violence, but the real battleground is among Hindus for the simple reason that they make up four-fifths of India's population. If Savarkar's ideas prevail among the majority, India will cease to be a land that strives to treat its minorities fairly. It will become more like the rest of the subcontinent, where religious minorities often live on the majority's sufferance.

Ironically, the controversial citizenship law that sparked the bloodletting in Delhi, which coincided with a visit by President Trump, recognizes the shoddy record of minority rights in India's near abroad. The law, enacted in December, for the first time introduces a religious test for citizenship by allowing followers of six faiths from Muslim majority Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh who arrived in India before 2015 to fast-track naturalization. The law pointedly excludes all Muslims -- including Pakistan's persecuted Ahmadiyya Muslims and Shia Hazara minority.

Since December, Muslims, secularists and students have protested the law. They fear that combined with a proposed (and currently deferred) national register of citizens, the new law will force Indian Muslims to produce documentation proving their citizenship, or risk disenfranchisement or being herded into detention camps. Such documentation isn't ubiquitous in India and it's likely that legal citizens will be caught up in the fray. Such a process, riddled with sloppiness, inconsistencies and casual cruelty, is already under way in the northeastern state of Assam.

In the run up to the violence, BJP leaders gave incendiary speeches and compared the protesters to traitors who deserved to be shot. Skirmishes between stone-throwing Hindu and Muslim mobs quickly devolved into deadly violence in which dozens of people were hacked, burned and shot dead. Mobs razed scores of small businesses. Thousands of people have fled their homes in fear.

BJP supporters point out that both Hindus and Muslims suffered in the violence. A rough count based on the official list of victims' names suggests that more than a quarter of the 44 killed were Hindu. In some neighborhoods, Hindus suffered disproportionately at the hands of Muslim mobs. Those killed included a police constable and a young intelligence officer.

All this may be true, but no reasonable person can view this as a contest of equals. The police in Delhi, overwhelmingly Hindu and under the command of the BJP's hard-line Home Minister, Amit Shah, did not even pretend to be evenhanded. In some places they reportedly stood down instead of confronting mobs. In others, there's evidence they actively abetted Hindu rioters.

A sensible government would work out a way to show compassion for persecuted religious minorities in India's neighborhood without stoking fears among Indian Muslims. A responsible ruling party would not confuse legitimate political protest with treason. But that would mean rejecting Savarkar's pernicious idea that Hindus are somehow more Indian than those who hold other faiths -- something Prime Minister Modi appears unwilling to do.

U.S. News: One Case Dogs Prosecutor Race

CHICAGO -- The primary campaign for Chicago's top prosecutor has been a fight over bail reform, gun control and when to press charges against shoplifters, but the race might come down to one issue: Jussie Smollett.

A trio of Democrats vying for the job have hammered incumbent Cook County state's attorney Kim Foxx for months on her record. But a focus on her handling of what authorities say was Mr. Smollett's bogus claim of a hate crime have contributed to a drop in her polling numbers and threatened to upend her re-election.

In January of last year, Mr. Smollett, an actor from the Fox television show ""Empire,"" claimed two men attacked him while using pro-Trump, racist and antigay slurs. The story soon unraveled as investigators determined Mr. Smollett knew the alleged attackers. He was charged with 16 counts of disorderly conduct -- counts that were ultimately dropped by Ms. Foxx's office.

Since then, a special prosecutor was assigned to reinvestigate both Mr. Smollett and Ms. Foxx's handling of the case.

Last month, the special prosecutor reindicted Mr. Smollett on six counts of disorderly conduct. He pleaded not guilty to the charges.

The investigation into Ms. Foxx is ongoing. She has been criticized for talking with a member of the Smollett family and connecting them with police investigators soon after he made his claims, actions which led her to recuse herself from the case. She was criticized again when her office dropped the charges against him, leading to allegations she hadn't actually recused herself.

Ms. Foxx has said she ""fell short"" on handling of the case by not communicating her decisions to the public, but defended her record more broadly.

""I feel like the voters of Cook County have the opportunity to look at the entirety of my record; and those who have concerns about this case, we've tried to answer them the best that we can,"" Ms. Foxx said in an interview. ""This is one case out of thousands that we have handled.""

The Cook County state's attorney is one of the most high-profile prosecutor's offices in the nation with more than 700 lawyers on staff responsible for misdemeanor and felony crimes in Chicago and the surrounding areas.

Ms. Foxx took office in 2016 with a slate of priorities including changing the bail system, decriminalizing marijuana use and prosecuting fewer gun-crime and shoplifting cases in a city known to be one of the most-violent in the country.

During her tenure, Ms. Foxx has prosecuted fewer gun crimes, has cut her use of cash bail and has effectively raised the threshold to $1,000 from $300 for the amount a person must shoplift before they are prosecuted as felons.

Opponents say Ms. Foxx's decisions have led to more dangerous streets as fewer gun arrests go to trial, as alleged criminals are put back on the streets before their trials and as shoplifters are emboldened.

During her tenure shootings have fallen 33% according to the Chicago Police Department, but in the past month gun crimes have increased sharply, giving her opponents fodder. In 2020, there have been 253 shootings compared with 195 in the same period last year.

But the race might come down to a single issue.

""There's only one thing that will define her legacy and that's Jussie Smollett,"" former city alderman Bob Fioretti, one the candidates challenging Ms. Foxx in the March primary, said in an interview.

""When you blow a big case the public loses confidence in everything you do,"" Donna More, a primary candidate who is a former assistant Cook Co. state's attorney, said in an interview.

The incumbent's main challenger is Bill Conway, a Navy veteran and former Cook County assistant state's attorney whose self-funded campaign has caused the cost of this year's primary to skyrocket.

Mr. Conway currently has nearly $6 million on hand largely thanks to his father, William Conway, a co-founder of the Carlyle Group hedge fund. The elder Mr. Conway has thus far given $7.5 million to his son's campaign, according to Illinois Sunshine, which tracks money in state politics.

Mr. Conway and his campaign didn't respond to requests for an interview or comment.

Ms. Foxx's re-election committee has $2.5 million on hand, but she has also been supported by a political-action committee funded by a $2 million infusion from billionaire George Soros's Democracy PAC.

Ms. Foxx holds a slight lead over Mr. Conway in the most-recent polling on the race, conducted last month by ALG research, a Democratic public-opinion firm.

The Democratic primary is March 17.

Insurance Tycoon Is Guilty in Bribe Case

Insurance mogul Greg Lindberg was found guilty Thursday on bribery charges after jurors determined he had attempted to bribe North Carolina's insurance commissioner by promising $2 million in campaign donations to obtain favorable regulatory treatment.

A self-proclaimed billionaire, Mr. Lindberg amassed a business empire in recent years, fueled in part by an unusual stream of loans from his insurance companies. He also had become the leading political donor in North Carolina and a major campaign donor nationally.

The judge declined prosecutors' request that Mr. Lindberg be taken into custody immediately, while awaiting sentencing. Mr. Lindberg will choose a judicial district as his base and travel outside it at the discretion of a probation officer while continuing to wear an electronic monitoring device.

The government alleged Mr. Lindberg sought the replacement of a senior regulator who was overseeing his insurers with someone of his own choosing. The move was aimed at getting a clean bill of health for Mr. Lindberg's life insurers, prosecutors argued, so he could make more acquisitions to further expand his conglomerate.

Jurors in federal court in Charlotte, N.C., listened to hours of secret recordings made by North Carolina Insurance Commissioner Mike Causey, who was cooperating with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and had numerous meetings and phone calls with Mr. Lindberg and his co-defendants.

Lawyers for Mr. Lindberg and two co-defendants had argued that the executive believed he was staying within election law as he made contributions to the state's Republican Party, to be forwarded to the commissioner's 2020 re-election effort.

The defense team argued Mr. Lindberg had been wrongfully entrapped by Mr. Causey into making the donations.

One co-defendant, John D. Gray, a consultant, was also found guilty. Another co-defendant John V. Palermo, an executive who worked for Mr. Lindberg's conglomerate, was found not guilty.

Jurors found Messrs Lindberg and Gray guilty of two related criminal offenses. One of the two charges could bring a maximum of 20 years of jail, and 10 years for the other, but the actual sentences are likely to be lighter.

Lawyers for both Messrs. Lindberg and Gray said they would appeal.

""We think the great weight of the evidence demonstrated this was a setup by a dishonest politician to eliminate a political rival,"" said Brandon N. McCarthy, one of Mr. Lindberg's lawyers.

""We respect the process, but we believe the jury came to the wrong verdict,"" said Jack M. Knight Jr., an attorney who represents Mr. Gray.

Brian S. Cromwell, an attorney for Mr. Palermo, said in a statement that evidence introduced at the trial showed that ""Mr. Palermo was simply an employee tasked with administrative functions who was in the wrong place at the wrong time.""

The case has been widely watched since indictments were unsealed in April 2019, in part because the case entangled North Carolina's Republican Party.

A fourth defendant, Robin Hayes, a former congressman and former chairman of the state GOP party, pleaded guilty last October to a single count of lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Mr. Hayes allegedly agreed to take Mr. Lindberg's donations to the state party and forward them to Mr. Causey's campaign. He awaits sentencing.

Mr. Lindberg bought life insurers in the U.S. and abroad beginning in 2014. He then lent at least $2 billion of their assets to entities he controlled, in an unconventional strategy that began before Mr. Causey took office.

After Mr. Lindberg's indictment, North Carolina regulators took control of four of the insurers. Those insurers have since asked a state court to appoint a receiver over hundreds of Mr. Lindberg's private entities that owe them money.

A separate federal probe is continuing to investigate potential fraud in Mr. Lindberg's business dealings, filings show.

In court Thursday, a prosecutor said as much as $1 billion of insurance proceeds were ""missing or unaccounted for."" He also noted that Mr. Lindberg had sent $3.8 million to 11 women from countries such as Russia and Ukraine in the past 18 months.

A spokesman for Mr. Lindberg said allegations of a financial hole are ""totally false."" He said Mr. Lindberg doesn't know where the government got 11 women. Mr. Lindberg paid $3 million to three U.S.-domiciled women who were egg donors, the spokesman said, while another $800,000 was paid to an employee of one of Mr. Lindberg's non-U.S. businesses.

Mr. Causey, who was on the witness stand for five days, said he ""is relieved"" the trial is over. He said he is focused on salvaging as much value as possible in the insurers.

""There is still the possibility that there are buyers are out there"" to acquire them, he said.

The defense lawyers sought to persuade the jurors that the government overstepped boundaries prohibiting authorities from inducing people into wrongdoing. Such entrapment can occur when a person with no intent to commit a crime is persuaded by law-enforcement officers or their agents to commit the offense.

Mr. Lindberg's lawyers contended that Mr. Causey had strong motivation to entrap Mr. Lindberg, who had been a major supporter of the former insurance commissioner, Wayne Goodwin, a Democrat. Mr. Causey narrowly defeated Mr. Goodwin in November 2016 and faces him in his re-election bid in November.

In multiple recordings, jurors heard Messrs. Lindberg and Gray criticize the deputy commissioner who was overseeing the Lindberg insurers and whom they wanted replaced. They told the commissioner they supported robust and stringent regulation, but contended that the deputy was ill-qualified to understand the insurers' investments.

New York Police Department officials said Thursday that overall crime in New York City rose by 22.5% in February, attributing the increase to a new law that eliminates bail for defendants accused of low-level and nonviolent offenses.

The biggest increase in crime involved stolen vehicles. In February, 493 were stolen, a 61.6% rise from the 305 during the same time a year earlier, according to newly released NYPD data.

The city also recorded 1,413 assaults in February, a 9.2% rise from 1,294 during the same time last year, NYPD data showed. There were 45 shootings last month, a 7.1% increase from 42 in February 2019. Murders were down 20% in February, and rapes decreased by 6% last month, according to NYPD data.

A state bail law that went into effect on Jan. 1 requires judges to free defendants accused of misdemeanors or nonviolent felonies. In a statement Thursday, the NYPD said that ""criminal justice reforms serve as a significant reason New York City has seen this uptick in crime.""

NYPD officials said since the beginning of 2020, 483 people who had already been arrested for a felony crime were rearrested for committing 846 additional crimes.

To address the crime increase, the NYPD is redeploying officers and moving some people from administrative roles.

""Victims are who this is all about -- finding justice for anyone who's already been victimized, trying our hardest to prevent future crimes and future victims,"" NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said at a news conference Thursday.

The Legal Aid Society, which supports the bail law and represents criminal defendants, said the police department was manipulating its data.

U.S. News: ICE Agents Sent To Sanctuary Cities

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is ramping up its enforcement efforts in 10 sanctuary cities, redeploying 500 investigators to increase surveillance and help arrest people living in the country illegally.

These agents, who typically work on complex long-term investigations, have been reassigned by ICE leadership to assist in the operation, set to run through the end of the year in cities that decline to assist in federal immigration enforcement, including New York, Chicago and San Francisco.

Agents with Homeland Security Investigations, a law-enforcement agency within ICE, began to be pulled off active investigations at the Justice Department in the past week -- including those focusing on human trafficking, child pornography and cybercrime cases -- and redeployed to the initiative.

The redeployment was reported earlier by the New York Times.

The shift comes weeks after a separate decision to temporarily redeploy 100 officers and agents with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, including several tactical border patrol units, to assist with the arrest operation.

Henry Lucero, who heads Enforcement and Removal Operations, the ICE arm that carries out deportations, said the need for increased personnel to arrest immigrants in sanctuary communities is a direct response to policies preventing local officials from notifying ICE when they plan to release unauthorized immigrants from law-enforcement custody.

ICE's arrest efforts have been stymied in recent years by uncooperative police agencies and by immigration advocates' efforts to inform people about their rights in such situations.

Sanctuary jurisdictions -- cities and states that restrain their law-enforcement officials' ability to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement -- argue the administration's focus on them is discriminatory and that greater coordination with ICE would discourage immigrants from working with local law-enforcement, making their communities less safe.

The dispute between these jurisdictions and the Trump administration has escalated in recent months.

Mortgage Rates Fall To Lowest Level Ever

Mortgage rates fell to their lowest level on record Thursday, pulled down by fears that the spread of coronavirus could weigh on the U.S. economy.

The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 3.29% from 3.45% last week, mortgage-finance giant Freddie Mac said. Mortgage rates are closely linked to yields on the 10-year Treasury, which this week dropped below 1% for the first time following an emergency Federal Reserve rate cut.

A decline in mortgage rates typically boosts home sales. But a worsening coronavirus epidemic and the efforts to contain it -- quarantines, business shutdowns and travel restrictions -- could keep would-be home buyers on the sidelines during what is usually a busy spring selling season.

The greater Seattle area, home to the first major U.S. coronavirus outbreak and one of the country's hottest housing markets, could offer some clues about what is to come, said Tendayi Kapfidze, chief economist at loan-comparison website LendingTree.

""If people don't want to go out and see houses, that's going to put a damper on demand,"" Mr. Kapfidze said.

If the virus hobbles the U.S. economy as it has China's, workers could lose their paychecks -- albeit temporarily -- and their ability to make big purchases.

The shutdown of many Chinese factories already has disrupted the supply chains of some U.S. companies, including home builders. That is a problem in a market that is already short on supply, said Realtor.com senior economist George Ratiu.

There are ""barely enough homes for sale to last three months at the current sales pace,"" he said. (News Corp, parent of The Wall Street Journal, operates Realtor.com under license from the National Association of Realtors.)

Already, signs of a slowdown are appearing in the housing market. Low rates pushed home sales to a high mark for the year in December. But existing home sales fell in January from a month earlier, an indication that cheaper borrowing costs are no longer enough to overcome five straight months of rising home prices and limited housing supply.

For now, though, plenty of buyers are using the opportunity to refinance and buy.

Charles and Thomas Porter of Raleigh, N.C., took advantage of falling rates to save on their mortgage payments twice. They refinanced about a year ago with online mortgage company Better.com to cut their 30-year fixed rate to 3.5% from 4.375% and to get rid of mortgage insurance.

Now, they are in the process of buying a four-bedroom house in Charlotte. Charles Porter, who works for a home-building company, and Thomas Porter, who works in pharmaceutical research, locked in a rate of 3.125%, also with Better.com.

The lower rate ""helped us feel confident in the move,"" Thomas Porter said.

The decline in rates is likely to continue to fuel a refinancing frenzy that pushed mortgage lending to its highest level since 2006 last year. About 14.5 million homeowners would benefit from refinancing if 30-year rates hit 3.25%, just below their current level, according to mortgage-data firm Black Knight Inc.

Refinancing applications were up 26% from the previous week and more than 200% from the same time last year, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data released Wednesday.

The jump in refinancings poses a challenge for banks and other mortgage lenders, which often hire staff when the housing market picks up each spring.

""You can never anticipate a drop like this, and there's no way you can staff up fast enough,"" said Esther Phillips, senior vice president of sales at Key Mortgage Services Inc.

Some homeowners and real-estate agents have complained of delays in closing their mortgages in recent weeks.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. moved some of its home-equity employees to the mortgage business last week to handle an increase in purchase applications and maintain its closing window.

This week, the bank paused email marketing campaigns on refinancing because of high application numbers, said Chase Home Lending Chief Marketing Officer Amy Bonitatibus. Chase is encouraging people to complete their applications online, she said.

Wells Fargo & Co., the largest mortgage lender in the U.S. by originations, said it has been hiring people to underwrite, process and close mortgages to meet demand.

Lenders can control the influx by holding their rates at a level that will attract a manageable number of applications. During those periods, mortgage rates tend to fall slower than the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note, widening the gap between them. On Thursday, that gap widened to 2.19 percentage points, its biggest since February 2009, according to an analysis by Dow Jones Market Data.

Still, many say lenders are better equipped to handle a rush of mortgage demand than last year, when the refinancing boom caught many off guard.

""This year maybe they are in a position to capitalize on it better than they were in 2019,"" said John Toohig, head of the group that trades whole loans, including mortgages, at Raymond James Financial Inc.

On Thursday federal prosecutors accused former UAW president Gary Jones of participating in a conspiracy to embezzle more than $1 million in dues money, among other alleged crimes. The details would make Jimmy Hoffa blush.

The feds say that for years Mr. Jones and ""other senior UAW officials"" filed fraudulent expense reports seeking union reimbursement for ""leadership and training conferences."" But instead of legitimate union purposes, hundreds of thousands of dollars went to ""lavish entertainment and personal spending for the conspirators,"" prosecutors claim. Mr. Jones allegedly spent $13,000 on cigars, and the feds say union money also paid for golf outings, high-end booze, spa services, amusement-park tickets, luxury condominiums and villas, and meals at pricey restaurants. Mr. Jones declined to comment through his lawyer.

The feds have spent years investigating corruption at the UAW, which represents some 400,000 active members from more than 600 locals nationwide. Mr. Jones is the highest-ranking former official charged to date, but 13 others have pleaded guilty in connection with the probe, including two former UAW vice presidents and other senior officials.

The UAW scandal is the latest, but such corrupt labor practices are widespread. The Labor Department audits unions, and in 2016 nearly one in five such inspections led to a criminal case. Imagine if 20% of all investigations of business ended up with a criminal charge. Democrats would be going wild with hearings about the moral crisis of capitalism.

Since Jan. 1, 2019, at least 60 labor officials and staffers have been convicted or pleaded guilty for union-related crimes, according to Department of Labor data. With few exceptions, their victims were hard-working, dues-paying union members.

Last month a jury found John Romero guilty of stealing nearly $800,000 from the health plan fund of the United Industrial Services Workers of America, where he was president. Union money helped pay off the loan on a Ford Mustang Shelby GT500 for Mr. Romero's son, among other items.

Audonus Duplessis, the former president of the union representing employees of the Smithsonian Institution and the Kennedy Center, pleaded guilty last fall to using union cash to pay for an online dating service, a Smith & Wesson handgun, and Armani clothes.

Keith Ludlum, also a former union president, pleaded guilty in January to embezzling more than $200,000 from United Food and Commercial Workers International Union Local 1208. Prosecutors said some of the money went toward trips to SeaWorld, a resort in the Dominican Republic and a shopping spree at Michael Kors. The list goes on.

Keep this shameful record in mind when Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden say they want Congress to repeal right-to-work laws in 27 states. They claim they want to protect workers. But both candidates would lock workers into union membership, and coerced dues payments, even when their labor bosses are crooks and thieves. Workers should have the ability to look after their own interests and opt out of paying dues, since union leaders are too often in it for themselves.

U.S. News: Biden Tax Proposal Would Hit Top 1%

WASHINGTON -- Former Vice President Joe Biden would raise taxes by $4 trillion over a decade, concentrating those higher levies on top earners, according to a study of his tax proposals.

Mr. Biden, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, would increase federal taxes by about 8% as a whole, but the effects would vary sharply by income group, according to the analysis released on Thursday by the Tax Policy Center, a Washington research group run by a former Obama administration official.

The top 1% of households would pay 74% of the additional taxes and they would see their after-tax income drop by 17% in 2021. That would be an average tax increase of nearly $300,000. Middle-income households would see tax increases averaging $260 in 2021, mostly because of the indirect effects of corporate tax increases. That would be less than 0.5% of after-tax income.

A Biden economic adviser said the candidate was committed to not raising taxes on the middle class and questioned how much effect corporate taxes have on workers.

The Biden tax plan, rolled out piecemeal throughout his campaign, is significantly smaller than the one offered by his rival for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. It would still mark a reversal of many of the tax cuts that President Trump signed in 2017 and includes proposals that the Obama administration could never get through Congress.

Mr. Biden would raise the top individual tax rate to 39.6% from 37% and limit deductions for people earning over $400,000.

People would have to pay income taxes on unrealized gains at death. That would change current law, which exempts those gains and imposes taxes only on the difference between the value at death and the value when later sold by heirs.

Capital gains would be taxed at the same rates as ordinary income for taxpayers with incomes above $1 million. Social Security taxes would apply to wages and self-employment income over $400,000, rather than being capped at $137,700 as they are this year.

The corporate tax rate would rise to 28% from 21%. Companies would also face a minimum tax of 15% on their global profit on financial statements as well as higher taxes on their foreign earnings.

The Biden plan includes some targeted tax cuts, including some to encourage retirement savings and purchases of electric vehicles. The Biden plan doesn't include some staples of other Democratic tax proposals, such as higher estate taxes, higher payroll taxes to pay for family leave programs and expansions of the child tax credit for low-income households.

The estimates assume that individual tax cuts would lapse as scheduled at the end of 2025, which would mean tax increases for most households. Democrats haven't taken a firm position on what to do then, but most generally say they don't want to raise taxes on middle-income households. Preventing that tax increase would lower the $4 trillion estimate, likely by several hundred billion dollars.

The center hasn't released full estimates of the Sanders tax plan, which calls for higher corporate taxes than those in Mr. Biden's plan and proposes an annual wealth tax.

Ex-UAW Leader Accused of Embezzling

A federal corruption investigation targeting United Auto Workers leaders has led to charges against its highest-ranking official yet: an ex-union president accused of stealing union funds to pay for private villas, expensive cigars, golf outings and other luxuries.

Federal prosecutors accused Gary Jones, the former head of the 400,000-member union, of conspiring with other senior UAW officials to embezzle more than $1 million and covering up the alleged misconduct with fake receipts and fraudulent expense reports, according to charging documents filed with a federal court in Michigan and made public on Thursday.

The 63-year-old Mr. Jones, who was named president in 2018, most recently led the UAW through contract talks with the Detroit car makers last fall and a 40-day strike at General Motors Co.

The charges are the latest escalation in the government's probe and come as the 84-year-old union is struggling to reverse membership declines and win back the trust of rank-and-file workers, whose confidence in senior leadership has been dented by the expanding federal investigation.

An attorney for Mr. Jones declined to comment. The UAW in a statement Thursday condemned the alleged actions by Mr. Jones and other former union officials who have been convicted in the probe.

Prosecutors said the alleged misconduct, spanning from 2010 to last September, was part of a racketeering scheme that violated federal laws.

In court filings, investigators alleged that a group of UAW officials, including Mr. Jones, established master accounts with hotels and resorts that they represented as serving union business, including paying for conferences and meetings. But the accounts were used to pay for personal use of private villas, high-end liquor, golf outings and other luxuries, prosecutors said.

Mr. Jones is also accused of benefiting from a scheme in which UAW officials wrote and cashed fake checks from accounts funded by UAW membership dues, prosecutors said.

He is now the 14th person charged in the federal probe, which became public in July 2017 and has resulted in more than a dozen convictions, including those of two former UAW vice presidents.

The misconduct prosecutors uncovered illustrates a pattern of longtime corruption among the union's top ranks, according to Matthew Schneider, the U.S. attorney in eastern Michigan.

The probe could potentially result in federal oversight of the union, Mr. Schneider said.

The government last put a major union under oversight in 1989, when it began monitoring the International Brotherhood of Teamsters to sever the union's ties with organized crime. That process saw the union institute democratic reforms that could provide an example for the UAW, Mr. Schneider said Thursday.

""It could possibly be a good model here,"" he said.

Mr. Jones resigned abruptly late last year as the UAW's governing board sought to remove him over allegations he and another top union official provided false and misleading expense reports to the accounting department. At the time, his lawyer said Mr. Jones was voluntarily resigning.

The alleged embezzlement scheme described by prosecutors took different forms and included senior UAW officials spending $290,000 in union funds on luxury condos and villas, restaurants, golf outings, spa treatments and amusement parks.

In one instance in 2015, Mr. Jones allegedly used union money to order $13,000 worth of premium Dominican cigars, such as Ashton Double Magnum and Monarch Tubos cigars, and then reported the purchases as expenses for a regional conference, according to the charging documents.

The federal investigation had initially focused on misuse of funds for training UAW workers at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, resulting in the conviction of a former top labor-relations executive at the company and several UAW officials. Fiat Chrysler has said the misconduct was perpetrated by a small group of individuals acting in their own interest.

The probe subsequently expanded as the government netted more convictions, eventually implicating higher-ranking UAW officials.

Federal agents searched Mr. Jones's home in suburban Detroit last summer, weeks before the union was to start negotiating new labor agreements, covering about 150,000 factory workers at GM, Fiat Chrysler and Ford Motor Co.

As negotiations were set to begin with GM in September, some UAW board members were pressing for Mr. Jones's removal, people familiar with the matter have said. But it wasn't until November -- after leading a historic 40-day strike at GM -- that he decided to step back.

Mr. Jones joined the UAW as a worker at a Ford glass plant in Oklahoma. He later served as the union's chief accountant before being elected to lead the UAW's now-defunct Region 5, which was based in Missouri and covered Southern and Western states.

Vance Pearson, a former UAW board member and close associate of Mr. Jones, pleaded guilty last month to the racketeering charges -- a sign federal prosecutors are considering a broader federal racketeering case against the union that could expose it to government oversight, people familiar with the matter have said.

Current UAW President Rory Gamble, who was elected by the board to succeed Mr. Jones, has vowed to root out malfeasance in the union. As part of that effort, he moved to close the Missouri offices once led by Messrs. Jones and Pearson. He has also sought to expel eight other former UAW officials charged in the investigation.

U.S. News: Schumer Walks Back Comments on Justices

WASHINGTON -- Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he regretted his remarks about two Trump-appointed Supreme Court justices ""paying the price"" for their potential rulings on abortion, adding they weren't intended as a physical threat.

""I'm from Brooklyn. We speak in strong language,"" the New York Democrat said on the Senate floor Thursday. ""I shouldn't have used the words I did, but in no way was I making a threat,"" he said.

""Of course I didn't intend to suggest anything other than political and public-opinion consequences for the Supreme Court,"" he said, ""and it is a gross distortion to imply otherwise.""

Mr. Schumer was addressing an outcry over comments he made Wednesday about Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh at a rally outside the court, while the justices heard oral arguments over a Louisiana abortion law.

""I want to tell you, Gorsuch. I want to tell you, Kavanaugh. You have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price."" Mr. Schumer said at the rally. ""You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.""

Republicans and others criticized Mr. Schumer over the comments. Earlier Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) admonished Mr. Schumer over the comments on the Senate floor.

""There is nothing to call this except a threat. And there is absolutely no question to whom it was directed,"" Mr. McConnell said. ""He literally directed the statement to the justices, by name.""

Chief Justice John Roberts, who in 2018 spoke out against President Trump's verbal attacks on federal judges, also had criticized Mr. Schumer's remarks.

""Justices know that criticism comes with the territory, but threatening statements of this sort from the highest levels of government are not only inappropriate, they are dangerous. All Members of the Court will continue to do their job, without fear or favor, from whatever quarter,"" the statement said.

American Bar Association President Judy Perry Martinez echoed the chief justice's concerns, saying the legal organization was deeply troubled by Mr. Schumer's remarks.

""Whatever one thinks about the merits of an issue before a court, there is no place for threats -- whether real or allegorical,"" she said.

Some Democrats said they were pleased Mr. Schumer had addressed the issue and contrasted his approach with that of Mr. Trump.

""That's not the Chuck Schumer that I know,"" said Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.), referring to his initial comments. ""I'm glad he has apologized from this standpoint: Don't let the president bring you down to his level, and that type of toxicity. We're better than that.""

Supreme Court justices have been in the political crosshairs recently. During a visit to India last month, the president said Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg should recuse themselves from cases involving him.

In November 2018, Chief Justice Roberts rebutted comments from President Trump disparaging federal courts in California, including his characterization of a jurist who ruled against the administration as an ""Obama judge.""

Free Speech for Lawyers

The Supreme Court on Friday will entertain a petition to extend the logic of its 2018 Janus decision that struck down compulsory public union fees to state bar associations. This subject is ripe for High Court review, but Justices should wait for a stronger case that is coming soon.

Attorney Arnold Fleck is challenging North Dakota's mandate that lawyers join and pay dues to the state bar association. Thirty-two or so states have similar laws, and several are now being litigated. Some conservatives are urging the Court to hear the Fleck case, but it is not an ideal vehicle for extending Janus.

Mr. Fleck filed his lawsuit in 2015, so his arguments draw more on the Court's pre-Janus decisions that didn't directly address whether states could compel non-union workers to subsidize union advocacy. Importantly, Janus held that government union positions in collective bargaining are inherently political because they implicate matters of public interest.

The same logic applies to bar association dues that support regulation of the legal profession. States can mandate bar-association membership because the Court in Lathrop (1961) mistakenly reasoned that First Amendment association rights were not at stake because attorneys do not have to attend meetings or vote in elections.

In Keller (1990), the Court applied the Court's faulty Abood reasoning -- which Janus overturned -- by declaring that attorneys may not be compelled to subsidize a bar association's political lobbying but can still be forced to support its legal activities. Bar associations commonly use attorney dues to take positions on issues such as tort and judicial campaign reform.

Mr. Fleck quibbles that North Dakota's bar does not ""affirmatively"" require attorney consent to subsidize its political lobbying. According to his petition for the Court to hear the case, the bar association directs attorneys to pay $380 and ""in small print"" at the bottom of a form says they ""may deduct $1.45"" if they don't wish to support its political advocacy.

Attorneys, he says, should instead be charged $378.55 and have to add the $1.45 if they wish to support the bar's politics. But he's missing Janus's fundamental point. Even bar legal advocacy implicates matters of public concern and therefore impinges on attorney speech rights. Mr. Fleck shouldn't be compelled to join the bar or pay it a penny.

A more straightforward challenge to mandatory bar fees is percolating in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals, where Wisconsin attorneys Adam Jarchow and Michael Dean are seeking to overturn the Court's Keller and Lathrop precedents in Jarchow v. State Bar of Wisconsin.

The two have compiled a long list of political expenses that have been funded by attorney bar dues including advocacy for juvenile justice reform, abortion coverage for exchange health plans, restoring felon voting rights and public financing of state Supreme Court campaigns. The Wisconsin bar has also opposed unemployment insurance fraud reforms, the death penalty and some state immigration laws.

States can regulate the legal profession without infringing on attorney First Amendment rights, they argue, and 18 states have done so. The Wisconsin case would provide a clean vehicle for the Supreme Court to address the constitutionality of bar-association dues without getting tripped up by Fleck's arcane argument over dues waivers.

It's important that the Court applies its constitutional reasoning in Janus to all circumstances in which governments compel individuals to join organizations and support political speech. The Court would do better to hold off on Fleck for now and wait for the stronger factual and legal evidence from Wisconsin.

World News: U.S. Faces Court's Afghan-War Investigation

The International Criminal Court ruled that its chief prosecutor could investigate alleged war crimes in Afghanistan that may have been committed by U.S. and other forces, deepening a confrontation with the Trump administration.

The appellate ruling Thursday allows prosecutors of the court, created under an international treaty but never recognized by Washington, to move ahead with investigations of actions during the lengthy conflict by the U.S., the Central Intelligence Agency, Afghan forces, the Taliban and the Taliban-aligned Haqqani network.

The U.S. has long opposed such an investigation, saying it could place U.S. personnel at risk of punitive action by an international body. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Thursday's decision ""a truly breathtaking action by an unaccountable political institution masquerading as a legal body.""

He said the timing, days after the U.S. government and the Taliban signed an agreement designed to lead to a lasting peace, is ""all the more reckless."" Mr. Pompeo said the U.S. government will take all necessary measures to protect its people against any action by prosecutors.

The U.S. last year announced visa restrictions against ICC officials involved in the probe and warned that prosecutions could imperil U.S. personnel and American allies.

The Trump administration had welcomed the court's rejection last year of the 2017 request by ICC prosecutor Fatou Bensouda to investigate possible crimes committed since May 2003 in Afghanistan. The judges in a pretrial chamber had ruled that an investigation ""would not serve the interests of justice.""

But the appellate ruling said that the pretrial chamber shouldn't have considered the ""interests of justice factor,"" but only whether there was a reasonable factual basis to proceed and whether it was in the court's jurisdiction.

In a statement, the Afghan government said war crimes are still being committed by the Taliban, while Kabul has addressed wrongdoing in its own ranks, including by prosecuting those responsible. A signatory to the treaty that created the ICC, Afghanistan said it would cooperate with the ICC chief prosecutor's office.

The chief prosecutor, Ms. Bensouda, in a statement welcomed the appellate decision, and said the investigation will be ""independent, impartial and objective."" Ms. Bensouda said her office would provide formal notice to the relevant parties.

The appellate decision drew praise from international advocacy organizations.

Solomon Sacco, head of international justice at Amnesty International, called it ""the first true hope of justice for the victims of conflict, who have been shamefully ignored for years, including in the recent peace agreement that has nothing to say about the crimes committed against them.""

Jamil Dakwar, director of the human rights program at the American Civil Liberties Union, said of Mr. Pompeo's comments: ""No one except the world's most brutal regimes win when the United States tries to disparage and sabotage international institutions established to hold human rights abusers accountable.""

Ms. Bensouda spent years collecting information on the Afghan war and potential crimes on all sides.

Prosecutors said in 2017 that they had information that provided a reasonable basis to believe that U.S. armed forces and CIA members ""committed acts of torture, cruel treatment, outrages upon personal dignity, rape and sexual violence against conflict-related detainees in Afghanistan and other locations.""

The U.S. isn't a signatory to the ICC, which began its work in The Hague in 2002 as a court of last resort for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, when national justice systems can't or won't take action.

Mr. Pompeo, who said the Afghan government had urged the ICC not to take this action, accused the body of political motives and disputed the factual basis for the decision.

REVIEW --- What We Can Learn From the 20th Century's Deadliest Pandemic --- In 1918, the Spanish flu killed more than 50 million people around the world. The lessons of that outbreak could save countless lives in the fight against the coronavirus.

Corrections & Amplifications

Commercial radio broadcasts in the U.S. began in 1920. A Review article Saturday about the 1918 flu pandemic incorrectly said that radio broadcasts were focused on war news in 1918.

(WSJ March 11, 2020)

(END)

The ""Spanish"" flu of 1918 was one of the deadliest pandemics in human history. Seeming to come from nowhere in the waning days of World War I, it spread through a war-ravaged world like wildfire. In a matter of months, a third of the world's population was infected, 50 to 100 million people died, and the global economy shrank by 5%.

The world of 1918 was very different from today's, where the new coronavirus is emerging as another potential pandemic. A century ago, antibiotics, modern hospitals, intensive care units and instant communication did not exist; most people lived in rural communities; intercontinental travel took weeks rather than hours. Now the world's population is four times larger, with more than half living in urban areas. National economies are heavily intertwined because of globalization. Health services are highly sophisticated in wealthy countries, though their quality varies greatly in the rest of the world.

From a public health perspective, however, there are important similarities between the 1918 flu and the 2019 coronavirus. Both were previously unknown viral strains for which there was no existing vaccine or proven medical treatment. Both spread through respiratory droplets and killed primarily by means of pneumonia and other complications. Both caused severe economic disruptions. With the growing risk of a full-blown pandemic, applying the lessons of the 1918 flu could save countless lives in 2020.

Provide effective leadership. In 1918, Philadelphia was one of the hardest-hit American cities, partly because it was, as the muckraker Lincoln Steffens put it, ""the worst-governed city in America."" In his book ""The Great Influenza,"" the historian John M. Barry describes the efforts of Dr. Wilmer Krusen, director of Philadelphia's Public Health and Charities department, a well-intentioned man who lacked public health experience and was prone to inaction. On Sep. 28, 1918, he allowed the city to proceed with a Liberty Loan parade to sell millions of dollars in war bonds, despite warnings that the event would spread illness. The parade drew 200,000 people; within 72 hours, every bed in the city's 31 hospitals was filled.

By contrast, Mr. Barry shows, St. Louis had the most success of any large American city in fighting the pandemic. Dr. Max Starkloff, the city's health commissioner, said that his goal was to ""keep the epidemic out of the city, if possible, and if that fails, to use every means to keep it down to the lowest possible number of cases."" He created an advisory body that included representatives of the city's chamber of commerce, schools, medical society, university, Red Cross and local public health services. He pursued what he called ""intelligent citizen cooperation"" through active outreach to the community. And he engaged health department staff, policy makers and teachers to implement individual quarantines and bans on public gatherings. Thanks to Starkloff's rapid, inclusive and systematic efforts, St. Louis's mortality rate from the flu was half of Philadelphia's.

Leadership mattered even more at the national level. President Woodrow Wilson was so focused on winning World War I that he would not listen to repeated warnings about the pandemic from the chiefs of the Army and Navy, or even from his own personal physician. The U.S. ended up losing 675,000 lives to influenza, compared with 53,000 killed in combat in World War I.

The past century has reinforced the importance of thoughtful, principled, decisive leadership in combating epidemics. Smallpox was officially eradicated in 1980, in what might be the greatest achievement in the history of public health. Dr. D.A. Henderson of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was the tenacious advocate who convinced the World Health Organization to take up the challenge of eliminating smallpox everywhere in the world; he then led the campaign to victory.

In 2003, President George W. Bush launched his Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, which was crucial in helping the people of Africa to confront the AIDS epidemic. He announced the program with words of grace and compassion, without blame or judgment: ""I propose . . . a work of mercy beyond all current international efforts to help the people of Africa. . . . This nation can lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of nature.""

Rely on classic public health measures. In 1918, the lack of national leadership meant that every city and state pursued its own approach to dealing with the epidemic. This created a series of natural experiments that allowed later researchers to assess the effectiveness of different approaches. They found that cities which implemented isolation policies (such as quarantining houses where influenza was present) and ""social distancing"" measures (such as closing down schools, theaters and churches) saw death rates 50% lower than those that did not. The cities that fared best were the ones that started isolating patients early and continued until the epidemic was unquestionably under control.

In the century since the 1918 outbreak, studies of seasonal flu infections and occasional pandemics have underscored the benefits of hygiene instruction and regular handwashing, which can reduce influenza cases by more than 40%. During the 2009 ""swine flu,"" school closures in Texas reduced acute respiratory illness by 45% to 72%. Such classic public health measures are sometimes as effective as the seasonal flu vaccine, which reduced infections by less than 40% in four of the last 12 U.S. flu seasons.

Give accurate information and build community trust. In every pandemic, people fall prey to stigmatization, distrust and rumor-mongering. The ""Spanish"" flu, as the 1918 pandemic is still widely known, did not originate in Spain. Rather, because the country was neutral in World War I, its uncensored press was the first to report on the disease. As a result, many around the world blamed the Spanish for the epidemic, and the nickname persists to this day.

As the flu spread in 1918, many communities found scapegoats. Chileans blamed the poor, Senegalese blamed Brazilians, Brazilians blamed the Germans, Iranians blamed the British, and so on. In the U.S., the country's millions of new immigrants had often been stigmatized as disease carriers during previous epidemics, but the 1918 flu struck every social class and every part of the country, so no single ethnic group was blamed for it.

Some populations, though, were more vulnerable to the disease than others. A study of data from 438 U.S. cities, published last year in the journal Economics and Human Biology, found a wide variation in pandemic-related mortality rates, ranging from 211 deaths per 100,000 people in Grand Rapids, Mich., to 807 in Pittsburgh. Half of this difference was attributable to three factors -- poverty, prior health status and urban air pollution. The same will likely be true with the coronavirus, which means that ensuring prevention and care for the most vulnerable is vital for saving lives.

Remarkably, despite the ubiquitous daily horror of the 1918 flu, there were few instances of flu-related attacks or riots. On the contrary, in her book ""Pale Rider,"" the science journalist Laura Spinney finds many examples of good Samaritans. In Alaska, 70-year-old Dr. Valentine McGillycuddy came out of retirement to fight the flu; in Tokyo, doctors went out at night to give free vaccinations to the poor; in Germany, the Catholic Church helped to train young women as nurses.

During pandemics, the reflex to help one another is more common than we might think. At the deadliest moments in 1918, when city governments in the U.S. were overwhelmed, volunteer groups -- from Phoenix's citizens' committees to Philadelphia's bluebloods -- stepped in to distribute resources to those in need. When communities did lose trust in their leaders, it was often because, in Mr. Barry's words, they had lied about the severity of the pandemic ""for the war effort, for the propaganda machine that Wilson had created.""

What the public needed was accurate answers to the questions raised by the appearance of an unfamiliar, deadly disease. Where did it come from? How could I get infected? Can I pass it on to others? How can I protect myself and my loved ones?

The historian Nancy Tomes has shown that in 1918, since radio broadcasts and newsreels were focused on war news, people turned to the print media for information on the flu. From trade magazines like Variety to scientific journals such as Survey, journalists asked difficult questions about how the epidemic was being handled and presented the best available answers to their readers. In the face of highly variable responses from public officials, the media served as an essential ally of the public health community in fighting the pandemic.

As we now face the specter of a coronavirus pandemic, it is reasonable to ask: Are we more or less vulnerable today than we were a century ago? In some ways we are clearly better off. We have modern vaccines and medical care, dramatically improved communication tools and healthier, better nourished populations. Modern governments plan in advance for how to respond swiftly to outbreaks, and there are mechanisms in place for international cooperation.

Yet according to the 2019 Global Health Security Index, less than one in five countries is fully prepared for a global pandemic. More than a billion people don't have access to essential prevention services, vaccines and medicines, and most of the world lacks intensive care services capable of handling severe cases of the coronavirus.

And we are vulnerable in other distinctively modern ways. Growing resistance to many antibiotics makes it hard to treat pneumonia and other bacterial complications. Large numbers of people suffer from heart disease, diabetes, cancer and other diseases that weaken the immune system. Rapid international travel has spread the virus at lightning speed. And as we are already seeing with the new coronavirus, globalized supply chains, dependent on just-in-time delivery of medicines, food and other essentials, are vulnerable to disruption in a global pandemic.

This face-off between the factors that reduce our vulnerability and those that increase it leaves humanity at considerable risk. Thousands, possibly millions, of lives depend on our ability to apply the lessons of 1918 and other pandemics. Only by taking full advantage of scientific and public health advances, investing in strong health systems and developing new technologies to prevent and respond to disease will we be able to meet the challenge of the new coronavirus -- and the other outbreaks that will inevitably follow.

On Thursday the New York Police Department held a press conference to report that major crime is up 22.5% this February over a year ago. Both the cops and the mayor attribute the spike to the bail reform pushed through the state Legislature in Albany last year, which is releasing people who have been arrested for one crime to go out and commit another.

""There's a direct correlation to a change in the law, and we need to address it, and we will address it,"" Mr. de Blasio said of the increase in crime. The mayor also said he was ""absolutely confident"" it will be addressed in Albany in the budget due April 1.

The Democratic Legislature, with the backing of both Mr. de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, ended cash bail last year. The goal was to prevent cases such as that of Kalief Browder, a 16-year-old charged with stealing a backpack. Because his family could not afford bail he spent three years in prison on Rikers Island -- much of it in solitary -- without being tried or convicted of a crime. After his release, he ultimately committed suicide.

The sensible part of bail reform was aimed at preventing injustices such as this one. The non-sensible part was to deprive judges of the discretion to keep behind bars criminals who remain a menace to the community.

The law went into effect on Jan. 1, and the NYPD numbers are sobering: ""In the first 58 days of 2020, 482 individuals who had already been arrested for committing a serious (felony) crime such as robbery or burglary were rearrested for committing an additional 846 crimes. Thirty-five percent, or 299, were for arrests in the seven major crime categories -- murder, rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny and grand larceny auto -- that is nearly triple the amount of those crimes committed in the same 58 days in 2019.""

Police Commissioner Dermot Shea underscored the main point: ""Each number represents a victim.""

Some on the political left, including a coalition of public defenders, claim the cops are deliberately manipulating the figures as ""scare tactics."" Ditto for Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, who is blaming the New York Post, which refuses to take dictation from the city's progressive powers. Mayor de Blasio is having none of it. ""They're wrong,"" he says.

Another crime problem that Mr. de Blasio doesn't acknowledge is the explosion of minor offenses since the City Council decriminalized such antisocial behavior as urinating in public, smoking marijuana in public, and turnstile jumping on the subways. This creates a culture of tolerance for lawlessness that the bail reform has compounded.

Polls show support for the bail reform dropping fast, and New York's chief judge says it is the only state in which judges do not have the ability to consider whether a defendant poses a credible risk of danger before releasing him. There is a simple fix that would take care of the biggest problem: Give judges the ability to weigh this risk before letting people out. If Albany doesn't fix this, we hope the voters run them all out office.

Cross Country: Spendthrift Illinois Races Toward Default

For 13 years, Puerto Rico has been in a man-made recession aggravated by natural disasters. In 2017 the island territory asked a federal court for bankruptcy protection, but it's still grappling with $70 billion in debt. Puerto Rico's fiscal fiasco offers a glimpse of what the future could hold for Illinois if it doesn't deal with its own self-imposed economic disaster.

Long the economic hub of the Midwest, Illinois has lost more than 850,000 residents to other states during the past decade. The state has been shrinking for six consecutive years and suffered the largest raw population decline of any state in the 2010s. Puerto Rico has been plagued by people problems too, shedding population in nine of the past 10 years.

Like Puerto Rico, Illinois is drowning in a sea of red ink. Growing government debt and a crushing tax burden are depressing economic growth. State spending is up, but personal-income growth is lagging. Since 2000, Illinois's per capita personal income growth has been 21% lower than the national average. Home prices are growing at the second-slowest pace in the nation, at only 2% compared with 5.1% on average nationwide. With speculation that Illinois could be the first state to go into default, ratings firms are paying attention. Illinois's credit rating is one notch above junk.

Shortly before Puerto Rico's bankruptcy filing, The Wall Street Journal described ""an exodus of workers, retirees and entire families"" fleeing a deepening economic crisis. ""For years, Puerto Rico borrowed more -- and incurred higher fixed costs -- to buy time to stave off deeper economic overhauls,"" according to the Journal report. Creditors and analysts said Puerto Rico's problems were aggravated by ""government overspending and promises to unions for employee benefits that officials knew they wouldn't have the resources to properly fund.""

The description also fits Illinois, but it doesn't have to. Illinois's public pension payments already consume nearly a third of the state budget, yet the unfunded liability -- which the state currently pegs at $137 billion, though others put the figure much higher -- continues to rise. Local government services are also being squeezed by pensions, contributing to rising property taxes that are the second-highest in the nation. Since 2000, Illinois has increased pension spending by more than 500% but cut by a third services that help students pay for college, protect children from abuse, aid the poor, and fight disease.

Moderate reforms could stabilize Illinois's five state-run and hundreds of local pension funds, but politicians have consistently refused to consider them, preferring instead to increase taxes steadily. Illinois has a culture of trying -- and failing -- to tax its way out of its problems. In 2011 then-Gov. Pat Quinn approved a temporary tax hike aimed at making a dent in the state's $8 billion in unpaid bills. By 2014, Illinois still had a $6.6 billion bill backlog, and lawmakers were calling for families and businesses to give up more money. Another permanent income-tax increase came in 2017, but again more taxes failed to solve Illinois's problems.

The problems, in fact, got worse. In his freshman year, Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed into law 20 new taxes and fees totaling nearly $4.6 billion, including a doubling of the gasoline tax. Now Mr. Pritzker wants a progressive income tax he claims will really solve the issue. He's asking voters to give him a green light on Nov. 3.

Mr. Pritzker is wrong to tell voters that 97% of them ""will not see an increase."" Because when voters decide whether to push forward his progressive tax, they won't get to vote on rates. As the Illinois Policy Institute reported, solving the pension issue would require a progressive income-tax hike of $10 billion. Mr. Pritzker's current plan to tax $3.7 billion out of the state economy dedicates only $200 million to pensions.

There is hope for the people of Illinois. State pensions can be fully funded, Illinois taxpayers can save $50 billion over 25 years, and dollars can be freed to support their eroding public services. Policy makers can finally shrink Illinois's pension liability by reducing the main driver of its growth: the cost-of-living adjustment, or COLA. Currently, the COLA doesn't reflect any actual cost-of-living increase, since it isn't pegged to inflation. By simply replacing the existing guaranteed 3% compounding postretirement raise with a true COLA pegged to inflation, among other modest changes, Illinois can save $2.4 billion in the first year alone. No current retiree would see a decrease in his pension check. Current workers would preserve their core benefit.

Failed fiscal policy has left the Land of Lincoln just a few steps ahead of Puerto Rico, but all isn't lost. Just as Illinois's financial disaster was man-made, so too can be its recovery.

A Court Corrects a Medical Injustice

A once-renowned Kentucky cardiologist is being released from federal prison after an appeals court threw out his health-care fraud conviction because the government withheld critical evidence at his trial.

Richard Paulus was convicted in 2016 of health-care fraud and false statements. After some back-and-forth appeals, he reported to prison last June. He wasn't supposed to be released until September 2023, by which time he would have been 76. But on Thursday the Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated his conviction. This decision should bring needed scrutiny to a pattern of dubious criminal prosecutions of doctors that lawyers have come to call ""stent cases.""

The way these cases work is simple: The government has questions about a cardiologist and shows a sample of his angiograms -- chosen by the government -- to a government-hired doctor. The government doctor reviews the angiograms and tells investigators any time he thinks the doctor gave the patient an unnecessary stent.

The government claimed that Dr. Paulus did this ""frequently, repetitive[ly], daily."" A trio of government doctors said that between 21% and 50% of the cases they reviewed showed unnecessary stents. The government called this a ""pattern"" that proved Dr. Paulus was a criminal.

But government doctors are no more reliable than private ones. A difference of opinion on whether or not a stent was necessary is often, well, just that. As one of the judges hearing Dr. Paulus's appeal remarked, the rate at which government doctors differed with Dr. Paulus wasn't an error rate but a ""disagreement in medical judgment rate.""

What's more, the government failed to disclose evidence to Dr. Paulus's lawyers that showed the disagreement rate was in fact much lower. It wasn't 50% or even 21% but, according to an expert hired by Dr. Paulus's hospital, just 7%.

The government argued during the appeal that its failure to disclose was harmless because a 7% disagreement rate is still too high. It told the court, as it has in all previous stent cases, that where one cardiologist thinks a blockage blocks less than 30% of an artery and another thinks it's above 70%, ""somebody is right and somebody is wrong."" The government claimed such disagreements ""should be zero or close to zero."" So, the theory goes, where a trained cardiologist like Dr. Paulus gets it wrong by calling a 30%-or-smaller blockage greater than 70% enough times, he must be a criminal.

But the appellate court rejected the government's argument and announced that Dr. Paulus had a right to know and let the jury decide whether a 7% disagreement rate is enough to diagnose him as a criminal. Indeed, the appellate court wondered itself whether it would have rejected Dr. Paulus's prior appeal had it known this information. How, when the government had known this all along, had Dr. Paulus just been forced to spend nine months in prison?

And so Dr. Paulus is, for the third time since the government targeted him nearly a decade ago, an innocent man in the eyes of the law. If the government elects to retry him, he now has the evidence he needs to show that instead of being a criminal, at worst he may have made, in the court's words, ""occasional mistakes or had occasional differences of opinion."" As doctors, like all people, sometimes do.

World News: Two Saudi Royal Princes Held, Accused of Plotting a Coup

Saudi Arabian authorities detained two of the kingdom's most prominent figures for an alleged coup attempt, further consolidating the power of the king's son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and clearing away once-formidable rivals to the throne, according to people familiar with the matter.

The detentions occurred early Friday morning when guards from the royal court wearing masks and dressed in black arrived at the homes of the two men, took them into custody and searched their homes, according to people familiar with the matter.

Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz al Saud, a brother of Saudi King Salman, and Prince Mohammed bin Nayef bin Abdulaziz al Saud, the king's nephew known as MBN, were both accused of treason, the people said. The guards also arrested one of MBN's brothers.

The Saudi royal court accused the two men of plotting a coup to unseat the king and crown prince, according to people familiar with the situation.

The two men who potentially had once been in line for the throne are now under threat of lifetime imprisonment or execution, people familiar with the situation said. The details of the alleged coup attempt couldn't be learned.

Prince Ahmed and MBN spent time as minister of the interior, a powerful position with oversight of troops and Saudi Arabia's large intelligence service. MBN had close ties to U.S. intelligence and was respected for his knowledge of security and terror threats in the Middle East. But over the past few years, their standing in the royal family has diminished as King Salman consolidated power and installed his son Mohammed bin Salman -- known as MBS -- as crown prince and the kingdom's day-to-day ruler.

The arrests cast aside two men who could have been rivals to MBS's claim to the throne if 84-year-old King Salman died or decided to abdicate. MBN had been first in line for the throne as King Salman's crown prince until 2017, when MBS was elevated over him.

Early in MBS's ascent, his social and economic reforms pleased many Western officials who had long called for the kingdom to lift restrictions on women and foster a more diversified economy.

But the prince's tactics for cracking down on corruption, silencing dissent and marginalizing rivals have since alienated many in the U.S. and Europe.

To curb corruption, MBS launched a surprise dragnet in 2017 that saw many of the kingdom's most powerful businessmen and royals locked up in the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton Hotel and accused of ripping off the government. Many were released only after agreeing to pay tens of millions of dollars to the royal court.

The next year, Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post, was murdered and dismembered in Turkey by men working for MBS. The backlash presented the biggest threat yet to the crown prince.

In a further crackdown on dissent, Prince Mohammed has arrested online critics and used armies of Twitter accounts to criticize people who question his governance. Men working for him were also accused by the U.S. Justice Department last year of paying two Twitter employees for private information on dissidents.

The arrest of MBN follows sharp bipartisan criticism of Saudi Arabia in the U.S. Congress, where support for the kingdom already has waned because of Mr. Khashoggi's killing and widespread civilian casualties in Yemen caused by a Saudi-led coalition using American-supplied weaponry.

MBN was for years a trusted contact for U.S. security and intelligence officials. As the head of Saudi counterterrorism efforts, he shared information with American counterparts about planned attacks and gained allies throughout the State Department and Central Intelligence Agency.

Many U.S. officials were dismayed by his ouster in 2017, said several former intelligence and State Department officials, since they felt he was the U.S.'s most reliable ally within the royal family.

MBN has been under house arrest for much of the time since MBS stepped in front of him, though he did appear at private events during an investment conference last fall, said people familiar with the matter.

Prince Ahmed's role has been more complicated. Some members of the royal family wanted to see the crown passed to Ahmed, the king's brother, rather than to MBS, people familiar with the matter said.

REVIEW --- The Discontent of Migrants Looms Over China --- The coronavirus has exacerbated the economic divide between middle-class urbanites and the country's rural underclass.

Even as the coronavirus spreads globally, there are some small signs of recovery at its source in China. After unprecedented control efforts -- mass quarantines, blockaded cities, halted transportation -- new reports of infections have slowed. Under government orders, and with the help of low-interest loans, shuttered businesses have begun to resume operations. The online ferment of angry urbanites who had criticized the government's mishandling of the crisis has dwindled for now. Even Starbucks has reopened stores, though only for takeout orders.

So is China set to resume a stable course of growth? Don't count on it. The country could still get hit by a second wave of the virus as the quarantines end, and its all-important export sector will receive a harsh blow later this year as the global economy slows. Worse, the virus has revealed the vulnerability of a pivotal, undervalued part of China's economy -- the hundreds of millions of migrant workers and their relatives in the countryside, who together make up roughly half of the population but have gained far less of the country's wealth.

Migrants are the Achilles' heel of the China growth story. They are still facing unprecedented virus-related disruptions in their lives and work. The majority have seen their incomes dry up, unable in most cases to return to jobs or get their farm goods to market. Industrial workers who have made it back from their villages now face two-week quarantines in factory dorms, with little or no pay, as at the facilities of Apple supplier Foxconn in Zhengzhou and Kunshan. Restaurants and other service-industry businesses, which rely on migrants but are particularly concerned about spreading the virus, have been among the slowest to reopen and rehire.

Even before the virus, migrant workers were increasingly unwelcome in China's cities; millions had started to flow back to the countryside as their opportunities had begun to fade. When a fire in a rundown Beijing apartment building killed 19 of them in 2017, the incident sparked mass evictions of migrants in cities across the country. Now locals who fear the spread of the disease and have long viewed migrants as outsiders -- expressed by the Chinese epithet waidiren -- are blocking their return to neighborhoods. Meanwhile, China's badly skewed health care system relegates most migrants to understaffed and underfunded clinics far from where they work, leaving them particularly vulnerable to the disease's spread.

After years of giving their xuehan -- or ""blood and sweat"" -- the migrants face an uncertain future. Their wages have gained ground only slightly compared with city dwellers, who still earn about three times as much. Some policy makers see these rising wages as a problem and are pushing for more automated factory floors, with municipalities subsidizing companies that shed workers. The policy is literally called ""robots replacing humans.""

What does this stark divide mean for China's trajectory? For several decades, most China watchers have shared two core beliefs. The first is that pressure to liberalize the political system would come from the urban elite. With rising living standards and better education, this group would build on the failed efforts of the student protesters of Tiananmen Square, eventually demanding not just better policies on quality-of-life issues like pollution but also real government accountability.

The second belief is that the Chinese economy would continue to be buoyed upward, despite challenges, on the backs of an ever-expanding middle class. McKinsey & Co. has predicted that China's middle and upper classes will rise from 182 million households in 2012 to 303 million by 2022, and multinationals have counted on this growth. China's leaders also have stoked the idea that with urbanization, the country would transition to a more consumption-driven service economy, That, they predict, would end reliance on polluting factories and on excessive investment, which has led total debt in China to surge to a dangerously high level of more than 300% of GDP.

The trouble is, neither belief is true. In 2003, I wrote a commentary piece for Businessweek entitled ""How SARS Is Invigorating China's Communists."" Now, as then, city residents likely will welcome a strengthening of political and social controls by the central party committee in the aftermath of the new virus. As the political scientists Lynette H. Ong and Donglin Han concluded in a 2018 paper based on survey research, China's middle class is essentially a conservative force. ""Those with higher income and education levels have considerably more to lose than the impoverished and poorly educated,"" they wrote in the journal Political Studies. ""The opportunity cost of participating in protest actions, a high-risk activity in authoritarian states, rises as one progresses up the social ladder.""

As for the continued expansion of the middle class, that can only happen if China integrates more migrants into economic life and stops treating them as second-class citizens.

Two policies have ensured that they mostly remain outsiders in the cities to which they've moved. One is the household registration policy or hukou, which binds them to their rural homes and bars them and their families from using the better hospitals and schools where they actually work. Second is China's land ownership system, which makes it nearly impossible to make much money from leasing or selling land in the countryside -- a stark contrast with the cities, where sales of apartments have led to an explosion of wealth.

Inequality in China has become a fast-growing and increasingly dangerous problem. Its Gini coefficient -- the standard international measure of inequality -- according to some studies now stands at 0.5, one of the highest in the world. One result of this divide in economic fortunes is that household consumption in China makes up a comparatively small portion of the GDP, currently about 40%.

After repeated promises, officials have done little to reform these policies, worried about the cost of giving migrants better health care and education. City dwellers themselves have no interest in sharing their advantages. One prominent cause of urban protest in recent years has been their opposition to the occasional government effort to bring more migrant children into city schools. Migrants are now increasingly expected to return home to generate wealth, despite the many obstacles there.

In research on life satisfaction in China by the economists John Knight and Ramani Gunatilaka, migrants unsurprisingly reported being less happy than urbanites. Less intuitive is that they were also unhappier than those who remained in the countryside. It's not hard to understand why, says Dee Lee, a Guangzhou --based labor consultant; it's because migrants are more aware than distant farmers that their living standard falls far below that of their urban counterparts. This growing disillusionment contributes to an expanding number of migrant labor strikes.

The coronavirus may eventually fade as a threat, but it has exposed the deep inequities that divide Chinese into two classes, an urban elite and an equally large underclass from the countryside that sees its small gains stalling. That split remains the biggest obstacle to China's development. Rather than ascending to a new urban middle class helping to power China's growth, the country's migrant workers -- left behind, as they are -- pose the biggest threat to its economic and political future.

EXCHANGE --- Heard on the Street: Virus Aftermath Is Not Like a Hurricane --- No roofs to be reshingled; even if recession is avoided, recovery is likely to be U-shaped and uncomfortably long

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

When a hurricane rolls in, a river breaches its levee or suddenly shifting tectonic plates shake the earth, the economy can experience a big hit. The ensuing recovery is often even bigger.

But the coronavirus epidemic is no hurricane. It will weigh on the U.S. and global economy far longer, it won't end with a sudden burst of blue skies and it won't lead to types of rebuilding efforts -- there are no roofs to be reshingled -- that have historically helped the economy bounce back from natural disasters.

The shape of the economy as it absorbs and eventually recovers from the coronavirus epidemic is more likely to be U-shaped than V-shaped -- with a prolonged bottom.

Ever since the scope of the coronavirus epidemic in Wuhan started becoming clearer in January, economists have been cutting their growth forecasts. Early this year, for example, Deutsche Bank forecast that U.S. gross domestic product would grow at a 1.7% annual rate in the first quarter, and 2.2% in the second. Now its economists are looking for GDP growth of 0.6% in the first quarter, followed by a 0.6% contraction in the second.

In the third quarter, they look for growth to resume, but, says Deutsche's global head of economic research Peter Hooper, ""there is no question there will be an overall loss of consumption and investment activity that does not come back.""

Like most of his peers, Mr. Hooper believes the U.S. will skirt a recession. That is by no means a given, though. The risk of a downturn is very real.

Even without taking into account the effects of full-scale spread of the virus in the U.S., it isn't difficult to imagine a scenario where as people avoid things such as travel and dining out to reduce risk, businesses cut back on employment, leading to an adverse feedback loop that further hurts spending. Nor is it hard to imagine that small and midsize businesses forced to temporarily halt operations will get pushed to failure.

There are two major ways the epidemic will affect the economy: through disruptions to the supply of goods from China and elsewhere, and through the measures adopted in the U.S. to curtail the virus's spread. There is plenty of uncertainty on both counts.

China's economy has taken a severe hit from the aggressive measures its leaders imposed to curtail the virus's spread. Data such as daily coal consumption and passenger traffic remain far below year-earlier levels and, while there has been some pickup in business as many provinces and municipalities have relaxed restrictions, the country is struggling to get back to work.

That has disrupted global supply chains, and the U.S. economy is getting hurt as a result.

The good news is that China's actions appear to have worked, or at least slowed the speed of the spread, laying the groundwork for an eventual recovery in activity. One key question: Will the lifting of quarantines and other restrictions lead to fresh outbreaks in China? That could make the resumption of Chinese manufacturing uneven.

Moreover, the spread of the virus to other countries making goods the U.S. depends upon, such as South Korea, is only making supply-chain problems worse. Shortages of key manufacturing components as well as finished goods could be a persistent problem for American businesses, sapping the strength of any recovery.

The other big way the virus will affect the economy is through how people respond to its threat. Already, people are canceling travel plans and avoiding gatherings. How bad the economic damage gets will ultimately depend on how far such social-distancing measures extend and what types of measures state and local governments might adopt to stem coronavirus's spread.

But it is hard to gauge the scope of such measures as epidemiologists are struggling to understand some basic facts about the virus, such as how fatal and transmissible it is. The underlying problem is that nobody knows how many people have actually been infected, says Caroline Buckee, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""We don't know how many people have no symptoms at all, or who have minor symptoms.""

But it could be awhile before that information is available. Meanwhile, Americans may only become increasingly cautious, placing spending at further risk.

And absent a vaccine -- something that, if it comes, realistically won't be available for quite some time -- signs that the epidemic are starting to be contained probably won't lead to people, businesses and authorities to abruptly lower their guards. Rather, they will continue to engage in many of the cautious behaviors that helped arrest the virus's spread. Scattered outbreaks may only reinforce that message.

So there will be no sudden booking of vacations and no immediate resumption of major business conventions.

No V, in other words. The coronavirus epidemic will weaken the economy, and that weakness will last an uncomfortably long time.

U.S. News: Immigrants' DNA Will Be Collected

WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration plans to begin taking DNA samples from migrants crossing the border or held in detention for use in a federal criminal database, a significant expansion of immigration laws that is certain to raise privacy concerns.

The new rule, posted by the Justice Department on Friday and set to take effect in April, will require immigration officers to collect cheek swabs from what could amount to hundreds of thousands of unauthorized immigrants taken into federal custody each year, including migrants at the border and people asking for asylum.

The move, which is sure to face court challenges, injects a new civil-rights issue into the debate about immigration policy. It will amount to a significant expansion of the government's DNA database, operated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, that primarily contains samples from people accused of committing serious crimes.

Collecting DNA samples from immigrants has long been one method floated to better track criminals who had once been in federal immigration custody but might not otherwise be known to law-enforcement officials.

In 2005, Congress passed a sweeping new law giving the government more authority to DNA-test and fingerprint criminals, an expansion of government power after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The law granted the Department of Homeland Security an exception so they didn't have to take these measures with immigrants in its custody. The Obama administration exercised that exemption, arguing such a collection effort would amount to an impossibly cumbersome task.

Officials with the Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security told reporters on Thursday that the expansion brings the government in better compliance with that 2005 law. The Justice Department also has argued the administration feels compelled to move ahead with the plan because it could help the government better identify immigrants who might commit crimes in the future.

The move is part of the Trump administration's broader shift to consider most immigrants entering the country -- even those who come to legal ports of entry -- as criminals. It has made all unauthorized immigrants targets for deportation, a departure from the Obama administration's policy.

It also follows a recent escalation in its long-running battle against ""sanctuary"" cities and states that adopt policies blocking cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The government recently has sued several states over their sanctuary policies, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement has launched a multicity arrest operation targeting cities including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago that refuse to help identify unauthorized immigrants.

Crossing the border for the first time is considered a misdemeanor under federal law and remaining in the country is a civil, rather than criminal, infraction.

The government's plan, which it made known in a proposed rule in October, alarmed immigrant- and civil-rights advocates, who said collecting DNA samples from people who haven't committed crimes would amount to significant violations of privacy. Many immigrants enter the country at legal ports of entry to ask for asylum, for example.

""The forcible collection and retention of DNA from hundreds of thousands of individuals each year would constitute a large and unjustifiable step toward full population surveillance,"" the American Civil Liberties Union wrote in a November public comment opposing the proposed rule. The Justice Department didn't alter its rule before finalizing it on Friday.

The Supreme Court has recognized a robust right to privacy in the U.S., even extending it to those living in the country unlawfully, though privacy laws have been relaxed within a hundred-mile radius of the border, where federal agents are permitted to perform warrantless searches and some unauthorized immigrants can be deported without a hearing.

[Infodemic]

The World Health Organization has avoided labeling the spread of the new coronavirus a ""pandemic"" and it remains an ""epidemic"""" at least for now. In a media briefing on Feb. 24, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that the decision is based on assessing ""the geographical spread of the virus, the severity of disease it causes and the impact it has on the whole of society.""

Meanwhile, WHO has approved of another, more innovative ""-demic"" term: ""infodemic.""

In a report last month, the organization warned of ""a massive 'infodemic,' an overabundance of information -- some accurate and some not -- that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it."" That warning was seconded by the MIT Technology Review, which observed that the virus has the makings of ""the first true social-media 'infodemic,'"" as ""social media has zipped information and misinformation around the world at unprecedented speeds, fueling panic, racism . . . and hope.""

""Infodemic,"" as a shorthand for ""information epidemic,"" has been circulating since 2003, when it was coined by the political scientist David J. Rothkopf in an opinion piece for the Washington Post. Rothkopf was addressing the SARS epidemic, writing, ""A few facts, mixed with fear, speculation and rumor, amplified and relayed swiftly worldwide by modern information technologies, have affected national and international economies, politics and even security in ways that are utterly disproportionate with the root realities.""

While ""infodemic"" may be a novel portmanteau term, its building blocks are much older. ""Information"" started getting clipped down to the snappier ""info"" as early as 1904, when a purveyor of horse-racing tips divulged in the San Francisco Examiner, ""Here's where I got the 'info' straight from the barn door."" As a combining form, ""info-"" took off with the rapid rise of information technology in the 1970s (""infosphere,"" ""infostructure,"" ""infomania,"" ""infographic"") and the 1980s (""infomercial,"" ""infotainment,"" ""infoholic"").

The element ""-demic,"" shared by ""epidemic"" and ""pandemic,"" goes back to the ancient Greek root ""demos,"" meaning ""people."" ""Epidemic"" literally means ""prevalent among a people,"" and started getting used for contagious diseases affecting whole populations in the early 17th century. ""Pandemic"" followed, using the Greek prefix ""pan-"" meaning ""all,"" for an epidemic that strikes a wider geographic area, spreading over multiple countries or continents.

When Mr. Rothkopf blended ""info-"" and ""-demic"" to create ""infodemic"" in 2003, he recounted to me in a recent email, he was ""struck by the fact that there were strong similarities between the way a disease spread through a population and the way an idea would 'go viral' on the Net."" In the case of SARS, he said, ""the infodemic impacted more people than the underlying epidemic that triggered it.""

The word ""infodemic"" had its own viral success after its initial coinage. Just two years later, in 2005, ""infodemic"" was included in the New Oxford American Dictionary, where it was defined as ""a surfeit of information about a problem that is viewed as being a detriment to its solution."" Since then, the term has re-emerged regularly regarding global health scares: in 2006 for the avian flu, 2009 for the swine flu and 2014 for the Ebola virus.

Mr. Rothkopf told me that he was surprised at how quickly ""infodemic"" caught on, but that he appreciates that the term has led to a greater awareness of how the spread of information -- and misinformation -- can carry its own risks. Understanding it is essential to managing public health crises, he said, ""and, in fact, any kind of situation in which viral spread of information can become a factor that may be bigger than that which triggers it."" With social media whipping up a global panic surrounding the coronavirus, we just might be facing the biggest infodemic of all.

China's Early Missteps Fed Epidemic --- As doctors raised alarms, officials dragged their feet to take action against the coronavirus

WUHAN -- It was on Dec. 10 that Wei Guixian, a seafood merchant in this city's Hua'nan market, first started to feel sick. Thinking she was getting a cold, she walked to a small local clinic to get some treatment and then went back to work.

Eight days later, the 57-year-old was barely conscious in a hospital bed, one of the first suspected cases in a coronavirus epidemic that has paralyzed China and gripped the global economy. The virus has spread around the world and sickened more than 101,000.

For almost three weeks, doctors struggled to connect the dots between Ms. Wei and other early cases, many of them Hua'nan vendors. Patient after patient reported similar symptoms, but many, like her, visited small, poorly resourced clinics and hospitals. Some patients balked at paying for chest scans; others, including Ms. Wei, refused to be transferred to bigger facilities that were better-equipped to identify infectious diseases.

When doctors did finally establish the Hua'nan link in late December, they quarantined Ms. Wei and others like her and raised the alarm to their superiors. But they were prevented by authorities from alerting their peers or the public.

One of the first doctors to alert Chinese authorities was criticized for ""spreading rumors"" after sharing with a former medical-school classmate a test result showing a patient had a coronavirus. Another doctor had to write a self-criticism letter saying his warnings ""had a negative impact.""

Even after Chinese President Xi Jinping personally ordered officials to control the outbreak on Jan. 7, authorities kept denying it could spread between humans -- something doctors had known was happening since late December -- and went ahead with a Chinese Lunar New Year banquet involving tens of thousands of families in Wuhan.

China has rejected criticism of its epidemic response, saying it bought time for the rest of the world. Mr. Xi told 170,000 officials in a teleconference on Feb. 23 that the country's leadership acted swiftly and cohesively since the beginning.

A Wall Street Journal reconstruction paints a different picture, revealing how a series of early missteps, dating back to the first patients, were compounded by political leaders who dragged their feet to inform the public of the risks and to take decisive measures.

Last week, Zhong Nanshan, one of China's most highly regarded epidemiology experts and the leader of the National Health Commission's task force on the epidemic, said officials had identified a coronavirus by Dec. 31 and took too long to publicly confirm human-to-human transmission. If action had been taken earlier, in December or even early January, ""the number of sick would have been greatly reduced,"" he said.

Although doctors worked hard to identify the disease quickly, they were hobbled by a health-care system that, despite huge improvements in the past 15 years, often leaves working-class people like Ms. Wei with insufficient access to general doctors and with crippling hospital bills.

When doctors did learn enough to sound the alarm, their efforts were stymied as the crisis became enmeshed in politics, both at the local and national level.

It now appears that, based on a speech by Mr. Xi published in a Communist Party magazine in February, he was leading the epidemic response when Wuhan went ahead with New Year celebrations despite the risk of wider infections. He was also leading the response when authorities let some five million people leave Wuhan without screening, and when they waited until Jan. 20 to announce the virus was spreading between humans.

As a result, the virus spread much more widely than it might have by the time Beijing locked down Wuhan and three other cities on Jan. 23, in the biggest quarantine in history. Those and other later measures appear to have slowed the spread within China's borders, but the global consequences of the early missteps have been severe.

""A lot fewer people would have died"" in China had the government acted sooner, said Ms. Wei, in an interview on Feb. 16. She is now fully recovered and home in the apartment she has barely left for almost two months. Her daughter, infected in mid-January, was still in a field hospital, she said.

China's government information office, its National Health Commission and local authorities in Wuhan and the surrounding province of Hubei didn't respond to requests for comment.

Precisely how and when the epidemic began remains a mystery, as does the identity of the first person infected -- Patient Zero. The dominant theory is that the virus originated in a bat and jumped to humans via other live, or dead, wild animals, probably sold in the Hua'nan market.

What is clear is that by the second week of December, several Hua'nan workers were falling sick with similar symptoms, including fever, coughing, fatigue and aching limbs. Even at that initial stage, there were indications that it was spreading to people with no market exposure -- a signal of human-to-human transmission.

Wuhan's government announced last month that the first confirmed case was a person surnamed Chen who fell sick on Dec. 8 but had fully recovered and been discharged from the hospital. The person denied going to the Hua'nan market, it said.

Wu Wenjuan, a doctor at Wuhan's Jinyintan Hospital, which specializes in infectious diseases and handled many of the early cases, confirmed in a phone interview that among the earliest cases were four people in the same family, including a 49-year-old Hua'nan market vendor and his father-in-law. The vendor got sick on Dec. 12, while the father-in-law, who had no exposure to the market, fell ill seven days later, according to a study by Chinese disease control researchers.

Ms. Wei, the market vendor who fell sick on Dec. 10, first sought help at a clinic across the street from her home.

For two consecutive days, she went there to take antibiotics through an intravenous drip, a treatment popular among Hua'nan workers because it was cheap and relatively quick. ""It's pretty effective for ordinary colds,"" she said. ""There's always a line inside.""

By Dec. 12, however, her condition didn't improve. She rushed to the midsize Wuhan Red Cross Hospital, also near the market.

There, she recalls, a middle-aged doctor informed her that her symptoms were compatible with bronchitis. She was sent home with medicine and told not to worry. After that, she went back to the clinic for more antibiotics. None had any effect.

She took a turn for the worse. On Dec. 16, unable to work and barely able to speak, she showed up at the emergency room of Xiehe Hospital but was sent home. She got a bed in a respiratory ward there only two days later.

She recalls seeing her daughters in tears before she lost consciousness. One ""would touch me every so often, afraid I would pass away,"" she said.

When Ms. Wei came around three days later, she was barely able to move, but remembers one doctor surnamed Kong telling her, around Dec. 21, that two other workers from Hua'nan market were at Tongji Hospital, another major one in Wuhan.

""He said your illness is really serious,"" she recalled.

By Dec. 21, there were about three dozen people showing similar symptoms who would later be identified as confirmed or suspected coronavirus cases, according to a study released on Feb. 18 from China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC.

At the time, though, doctors had yet to establish the common link between them.

Zhang Jinnong, the head of Xiehe Hospital's emergency department, said he remembers the first Hua'nan patients coming in between Dec. 10 and 16.

He said he was relatively unconcerned at first, because there were no signs of the virus spreading between people. ""Back then, I wasn't afraid at all -- I was even relaxed,"" Dr. Zhang said in a phone interview. ""The early stages made us drop our guard.""

Another local hospital, Wuhan Central, received its first coronavirus case, a 65-year-old man with a fever but no other symptoms, on Dec. 16, although doctors didn't know it then, said Ai Fen, who runs the emergency department there, in an interview on Feb. 18.

A CT scan revealed infection in both his lungs, but antibiotics and anti-flu drugs wouldn't shift it. Only after he was transferred to another hospital did staff there learn that he worked at Hua'nan, Dr. Ai said.

It would be another 11 days before doctors started to make the connection between the Hua'nan cases.

On Dec. 27, Dr. Ai received a second patient with similar symptoms, and ordered a laboratory test. By the following day, she had seen seven cases of unexplained pneumonia, four affiliated with the Hua'nan market, including a vendor's mother.

This could be a contagious disease, she remembers thinking to herself.

She informed the hospital's leadership on Dec. 29, and it notified the China CDC's district office, which said it had heard similar reports from elsewhere in Wuhan, according to Dr. Ai.

A doctor at the Hubei Hospital of Integrated Traditional Chinese and Western Medicine had also raised the alarm on Dec. 27, state media would report later.

On Dec. 30, Dr. Ai got the results for the laboratory test. It said ""SARS coronavirus,"" the same kind of virus that had killed 774 people world-wide after emerging in China in 2002.

Terrified, she immediately told her superiors. She also circled the result with a pink marker pen and sent a photo to a medical-school classmate, together with a video clip of lung scans from another patient.

That became the first evidence leaked to the public after they were passed to another doctor at Wuhan Central, Li Wenliang, whose death from the virus in February would trigger an outpouring of grief and anger at Chinese authorities.

In a group posting on the WeChat messaging app that afternoon, Dr. Li told more than 100 of his medical-school classmates ""7 SARS cases confirmed at Hua'nan Seafood Market"" and said the patients were ""quarantined in the Emergency Department of our hospital.""

By that night, the information was circulating widely on social media.

Hospital officials called Dr. Li to reprimand him. In a self-criticism letter confirmed by the Journal, he wrote that the leak ""had a negative impact"" on the National Health Commission's efforts.

Meanwhile, evidence of human-to-human transmission was mounting.

Lu Xiaohong, a doctor at Fifth Hospital in Wuhan, became alarmed on Dec. 25 when she heard that medical staff at two hospitals had been quarantined after being infected with an unidentified form of viral pneumonia, she told the China Youth Daily newspaper.

Early in the morning on Jan. 1, another patient arrived at Dr. Ai's department from the Red Cross Hospital, where Ms. Wei was briefly treated nearly three weeks earlier. The owner of a private clinic near the market had become seriously sick after treating several patients suffering from fever.

Fearing her colleagues could be infected the same way, Dr. Ai again alerted hospital authorities on Jan. 1, and ordered her department to put on masks.

That night, the hospital's discipline department summoned her for a chat the next day. She was criticized for ""spreading rumors,"" according to Dr. Ai.

The hospital's leadership also banned staff from discussing the disease in public or via texts or images, Dr. Ai said. Eight days later, a nurse in her department became ill and was later confirmed to be infected by the coronavirus. By early March, three doctors at the hospital had died from the infection.

After warnings from local hospitals, the Wuhan office of the China CDC did a retrospective search for similar pneumonia cases with links to the Hua'nan market. It found several more, and reported those results on Dec. 30 to the national CDC headquarters, which sent a team of nine experts to Wuhan the next day.

The World Health Organization said its China office was informed on Dec. 31. Wuhan health authorities also issued the first official public statement on the outbreak that day, announcing 27 cases of suspected viral pneumonia related to the Hua'nan market.

""The investigation so far has not found any obvious human-to-human transmission or infection of medical staff,"" the statement from the Wuhan branch of the National Health Commission said. ""The disease is preventable and controllable.""

Medical authorities in Wuhan, meanwhile, were trying to get as many as possible of the suspected cases transferred to Jinyintan, the hospital that specializes in infectious diseases, where staff had built dedicated quarantine areas, fearing the virus could spread.

Some health experts say medical authorities made an error at that point by looking only for patients who had fever, direct Hua'nan market exposure and chest scans ruling out regular bacterial pneumonia.

In doing so, they overlooked those who had come in close contact with such cases, and other patients who had no direct exposure to the market, milder symptoms or illnesses other than pneumonia, the health experts said.

Back at Xiehe Hospital, Ms. Wei, the seafood vendor, had to undergo a new series of tests, including a throat swab and an endoscopy up her nose and down her airways. Like many other early cases, she couldn't be officially diagnosed with the virus because scientists had yet to genetically decode it and develop a test.

Her doctors treated her as a suspected case. They donned masks, isolated her and tried to move her to Jinyintan, but she refused, thinking they were trying to get rid of her because they suspected market workers were unhygienic. ""I thought to myself, I sell clean things,"" she said. ""I sell live shrimp.""

One of seven early cases at Hubei Integrated also refused to be transferred. A doctor at Jinyintan got samples from the other six and sent them to the Wuhan Institute of Virology to try to identify the illness.

The institute would later reveal that it had identified a new coronavirus and mapped its genetic sequence by Jan. 2 -- critical steps toward containing the epidemic and designing a vaccine. But that wasn't made public at the time.

On Jan. 5, a medical research center in Shanghai notified the National Health Commission that one of its professors had also identified a SARS-like coronavirus and mapped the genome using a sample from Wuhan, according to an internal notice.

The virus was likely spreading via the respiratory tract, and ""appropriate prevention and control measures in public places"" were recommended, said the notice from the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center. The center's director confirmed its authenticity.

Still, Chinese authorities didn't publicly confirm an outbreak of a new coronavirus until Jan. 9, two days after The Wall Street Journal revealed it, citing people familiar with the findings. They didn't share the genome with the rest of the world until Jan. 12.

While WHO and Chinese officials have repeatedly trumpeted the swift sharing of the genome data as evidence of transparency in Beijing's response, some epidemiologists believe it should have happened at least a week earlier.

They, and many local doctors, also fault the government's repeated denials of human-to-human transmission in the first half of January. ""We knew then that the government was lying,"" said one local doctor. ""But we don't know why they needed to lie. Maybe they thought it could be controlled.""

Only after a WHO official told a press conference on Jan. 14 that there could be ""limited human-to-human transmission, potentially among families,"" did the Wuhan branch of the National Health Commission echo that position.

Even then, Li Qun, the head of the China CDC's emergency center, played down the threat, telling Chinese state television on Jan. 15: ""After careful screening and prudent judgment, we have reached the latest understanding that the risk of human-to-human transmission is low.""

Hubei province and Wuhan, its capital, were holding annual sessions of their local legislative and advisory bodies between Jan. 6 and 17. Local authorities routinely try to suppress bad news in such periods.

Between Jan. 5 and 17, no new cases were announced. And on Jan. 18, Wuhan went ahead with a yearslong tradition of hosting a mass Chinese Lunar New Year banquet, where families pose for group photos and use chopsticks to share dishes.

The first public indication of Mr. Xi's involvement came on Jan. 20, when official media said he had ordered officials to contain the virus.

It now appears that he was in charge of the response since at least a Jan. 7 meeting of the party's top leadership, made public in February as anger mounted at a perceived lack of leadership from Beijing.

Chinese doctors and scientists said there were errors and delays by some experts sent by the government to Wuhan.

Among those sent in early and mid-January was Peking University's Wang Guangfa, who told official media on Jan. 10 that the virus had little capacity to cause illness and the epidemic was under control. Dr. Wang, who declined to comment, announced later that he had caught the virus.

Some of the experts had access to the first 41 confirmed cases at Jinyintan but were reluctant to share data with others before publication in a prestigious medical journal, according to some doctors and scientists involved in the response.

""Everyone was beginning to prepare for similar cases in other provinces and yet had no firsthand information on the virus and how it worked,"" said a doctor who repeatedly asked for more details and was brushed off. ""Doctors across China were really angry about this.""

Another doctor involved said Chinese authorities had been looking solely for evidence that the virus was spreading from patients to medical workers, overlooking signs that it was moving between patients, their relatives and others.

With international concern mounting and China's health authorities receiving reports of fresh cases in Wuhan and some other cities, Beijing sent a new team of experts to Wuhan on Jan. 18, the day of the Lunar New Year banquet.

That team included an infectious disease expert from Hong Kong who had reported the day before that human-to-human transmission occurred in a family from the city of Shenzhen who had visited relatives in Wuhan but had not been to the Hua'nan market.

It also included Dr. Zhong, as the leader of the task force, who had played a key role in combating SARS. Among the evidence local doctors presented to Dr. Zhong was that of a single patient who had infected 14 medical workers at Xiehe Hospital, according to that hospital's emergency chief.

Still, when President Xi made his first public statement on the crisis on Jan. 20, he made no explicit mention of human-to-human transmission, even as he told officials it was vital to contain the virus during the Lunar New Year travel period.

A few hours later, it was Dr. Zhong who announced on Chinese state television that the coronavirus was indeed spreading between people.

His team privately informed the Chinese leadership that the situation was more dire than they realized, and presented a series of recommendations, including locking down Wuhan, according to a city official familiar with the discussions.

As a WHO committee met in Geneva to discuss whether to declare a global emergency, President Xi imposed a cordon sanitaire on Jan. 23 on Wuhan and three other cities, affecting some 20 million people. By late February, new cases were slowing in China but rising sharply in other countries.

U.S. News: Global Outbreaks Are Likely to Increase --- Pandemic experts say the new coronavirus shouldn't have come as a surprise at all

The rapid and global spread of the deadly new coronavirus caught households, business leaders, investors and policy makers off guard, but health experts and economists who study pandemics say it shouldn't have come as a surprise at all.

Epidemics of infectious diseases have become a regular part of the global landscape in the past quarter-century, thanks in part to economic trends including urbanization, globalization and increased human consumption of animal proteins as society becomes more prosperous, these experts say.

The public needs to prepare for more of them, they add.

An old rule of thumb in pandemic research was that such events happened about three times every century, said David Finnoff, an economist at the University of Wyoming College of Business. So far this century, the world has already confronted an array of viral scares, including SARS in 2002 and 2003, the swine flu (also known as H1N1) in 2009, MERS in 2012, Ebola in 2014 to 2016, Zika in 2015 and Dengue fever in 2016.

The incidence of infectious disease events has more than doubled from the 1940s to 1960s, according to EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit research group that built a database tracking disease events globally. The rate of such incidents surged in the 1980s with the advent of HIV and is now rising, says Peter Daszak, the group's president.

""They're increasing exponentially,"" he said.

Already this century infectious disease pandemics -- not counting the common influenza -- have claimed more than 300,000 lives globally, according to Harvard researchers David Bloom and Daniel Cadarette.

Mr. Daszak estimates pandemics could cost as much as $23.5 trillion over the next 30 years. That estimate includes not just lost economic activity and property, but also the statistical value of lost human lives.

Urbanization means people are packing together more tightly, making them more prone to catching bugs from others. Ebola is one example. It isn't a new disease but became widespread and deadly when it spread to large cities in Liberia and Sierra Leone.

At the same time, globalization means people are venturing out farther across borders, giving bugs wider reach.

Moreover, animal-protein consumption is putting people in closer contact with livestock such as pigs and chickens, which can act as carriers of disease from other species. Between 2000 and 2019, global consumption of chicken grew to 97 million metric tons from 53 million, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. And as dense populations spread, Mr. Daszak says, people and their livestock are coming into closer direct contact with wildlife such as bats that are direct carriers of disease.

""Urbanization, agricultural intensification and deforestation are all part of the land-use change variable that was significantly correlated with emerging infectious diseases,"" Mr. Daszak said.

China, the epicenter of the latest outbreak, is also the epicenter of many of the economic trends giving unhealthy viruses a wider canvas on which to multiply. No country has urbanized more rapidly in the past quarter-century, according to World Bank estimates. In 2018, 59% of its population lived in urban areas, according to the World Bank, up from 36% in 2000 and 19% in 1980.

The U.S. has urbanized, too, though at a slower rate. Between 2000 and 2018 its urban population increased to 82% of total population from 79%.

During the same period, China became the center of globalization, as multinational companies built their manufacturing bases there. Between 2003 and 2018, air traffic between the U.S. and China increased to 8.5 million passengers from fewer than 700,000, according to the U.S. Transportation Department.

""Viruses don't need passports,"" said Michael Merson, a professor at Duke University's Global Health Institute.

Wuhan, the Chinese city where the new coronavirus and the illness it causes, Covid-19, first showed up, is an example of these trends. Between 2000 and 2018, its population grew from eight million to 11 million. In the process, developed land in the city more than tripled from about 210 square kilometers to 720 square kilometers, according to the Wuhan Statistics Bureau.

Wuhan opened a subway system in 2004 as a single line with 10 stations, the Communist Party-run People's Daily reported at the time. By December, it had grown to nine lines with 228 stations that handled 1.2 billion trips last year, according to state broadcaster Wuhan TV.

People have been flowing into the city in greater numbers, too, aided by more and speedier travel links. Wuhan hosted about 20 million tourists in 2000 and 288 million in 2018. In 2009, the city got high-speed rail service to Guangzhou, a prosperous megacity in southern China, as well as its third passenger railway station, according to the local Communist Party-run Changjiang Daily.

Travelers can reach 25 major cities from Wuhan on high-speed trains, cutting the time it takes to get to Beijing from 10 hours to five. Wuhan Tianhe International Airport replaced an older airport in 1995 and by the second half of 2018 had flights to 52 international destinations and 84 domestic ones, according to the provincial government of Hubei, of which Wuhan is the capital.

This development in the city coexists with trade in wildlife, a presumed vector of infection that Chinese authorities have promised to shut down across the country.

The rise of global pandemics creates a problem of collective action, says Ramanan Laxminarayan, a researcher at Princeton University. One of the best ways to combat the spread of a virus is for authorities to report their emergence rapidly to isolate bugs in early stages.

Individual countries, however, have an incentive to delay reporting until a problem is certain, because notifying others comes with economic costs, such as reduced travel and trade. In that context, reporting delays in China and Iran aren't a surprise, Mr. Laxminarayan said.

Mr. Finnoff said the U.S. needs to build a stronger health infrastructure to fight future pandemics.

""We have a huge military that is out there ready to be deployed to reduce the risk to this country from anything that occurs. Most of the time it is not being used, it is waiting,"" he said. The U.S. needs to start thinking about preparing for pandemics the same way, he said.

Mr. Daszak said he thinks the current crisis will prove to be manageable, noting that the mortality rate of Covid-19 isn't as great as SARS and the spread isn't rampant. ""I'm not hiding in my bunker right now,"" he said. ""We're going to get hit by a much bigger one sometime in the next 10 years.""

Politics: Sanders's Plan Dramatically Alters Taxation

WASHINGTON -- Presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is trying to expand federal taxation on a scale not seen since World War II, pursuing policies that would end the nation's run as one of the industrialized world's lowest-taxed countries.

Mr. Sanders's combination of taxes on wealth, income, financial transactions, corporate profits, payrolls, estates and capital gains would hit rich Americans from every direction. If Congress were to pass all of his plans, the total U.S. tax burden -- including federal, state and local taxes -- would resemble Canada's or Germany's rather than being near the bottom of the pack of rich nations.

Mr. Sanders views higher taxes as a means to pay for bigger health-care, housing, education and climate-change programs, and those plans would cost at least $40 trillion over a decade, according to the campaign, or a 66% increase in federal spending. And he seeks to stick companies and the top 1% of households with most of the bill.

""In developing our tax policies, our major goal is to make sure that we are reducing the massive level of income and wealth inequality that exists in America today,"" said Warren Gunnels, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders.

Independent analyses have cast doubt on whether Mr. Sanders's proposals add up, suggesting that the campaign overestimates how much money his taxes would raise and underestimates how much the new programs would cost. Mr. Sanders disputes that.

He also doesn't explicitly advocate more deficit spending, aiming to show that his tax increases, nontax revenue increases and some spending cuts will cover the costs of his new programs. His aides also point to his votes against tax cuts and wars as evidence of a Sanders style of fiscal hawkishness.

His proposed tax increases top $30 trillion over a decade, by the campaign's own reckoning. That is more than 10% of gross domestic product and at least a 60% increase in taxes over what would happen otherwise.

The last U.S. tax increase of this magnitude occurred from 1942 to 1944, during World War II, when the income tax was expanded to the middle class, raising federal revenue to 20.5% of gross domestic product from 9.9%.

""You made the income tax a mass tax, which was a big deal,"" said Mark Mazur, who was the top Treasury Department tax-policy official in the Obama administration. ""This is like five of those.""

Since World War II, U.S. federal revenue has stayed between 14.2% and 20% of GDP, and is slated to average 17.4% over the next decade.

Mr. Sanders's proposed tax increases would send that level past 28%.

""These are unprecedented tax increases. These are huge,"" said Nicole Kaeding, an economist at the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, a nonprofit research group affiliated with a conservative organization.

Almost all of Mr. Sanders's proposed tax increases -- except for middle-class taxes designed to replace insurance premiums and out-of-pocket health-care costs -- target the top of the income and wealth distribution, the millionaires and billionaires he castigates on the campaign trail.

The Progressive Policy Institute, a center-left group, estimates that his proposed spending would exceed revenue by $25 trillion over a decade, with much of the gap due to estimated costs of his Medicare for All program. Mr. Sanders's aides say their plans add up.

At some level, what separates Mr. Sanders from other Democrats on tax policy isn't necessarily direction but degree.

Former Vice President Joe Biden, who is Mr. Sanders's chief remaining rival, along with the party's leading tax-policy thinkers and its former presidential candidates, all want to raise taxes, concentrating on high-income households. They want to reverse parts of the 2017 tax law, let people shield less money from the estate tax, and close the tax-rate gap between investment income and wages.

""I favor higher taxes on high-income people,"" said Austan Goolsbee, an economist who worked for President Obama and supported former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg's campaign.

""I don't think Bernie or the other Democratic candidates are wrong that we are in a historical abnormality of tax giveaways to high-income people and big corporations,"" he said. ""The question is: Is it conceivable to get $20 trillion of taxes just from high-income people?""

Boeing Co.'s engineering mistakes and ""culture of concealment,"" coupled with insufficient federal safety oversight, led to two fatal crashes of the plane maker's 737 MAX aircraft, House investigators said in a report released Friday.

The preliminary findings, issued by Democrats on the House Transportation Committee, describe in stark terms the engineering and regulatory lapses revealed in five public hearings over the past year into the design and certification of the MAX, which was grounded around the world last March following a second crash of the passenger jet.

The crashes of the Ethiopian Airlines flight and the Lion Air flight five months earlier, claimed a total of 346 lives. The protracted grounding continues as Boeing works on software fixes and develops pilot-training requirements that will win the approval of regulators. Boeing halted the aircraft's production in January.

Friday's report details Boeing's determination at various levels -- years before the MAX was approved by the Federal Aviation Administration -- to avoid putting pilots through costly ground-simulator training. That single-minded goal was evident across Boeing's engineering, marketing and management ranks, according to the report, and resulted in various efforts to mislead or withhold information from FAA officials during the lengthy certification process.

Both crashes occurred after pilots failed to counteract a new automated flight-control feature -- details of which they didn't know -- that misfired to repeatedly and aggressively push down the nose of their aircraft.

The 13-page congressional report offers new details about what it described as Boeing's improper conduct related to MAX, including fresh insight into the period during the plane's development and in the weeks after the first crash.

In July 2014, three years before the MAX started flying passengers and two years before the FAA made a decision regarding the extent of mandatory pilot training, the report says Boeing issued a press release seemingly predetermining the regulatory process. The company said pilots already flying earlier 737 models ""will not require a simulator course to transition to the 737 MAX."" According to the report, Boeing made the same pledge to airliner customers, including Ethiopian Airlines.

During the plane's development, Boeing successfully argued to remove references to the flight-control system, known as MCAS, from official manuals. As the House committee revealed earlier, the company also went to great lengths to keep FAA officials from scrutinizing and potentially recognizing the hazards of the system, even referring to it by another name.

The FAA's oversight effort was ""grossly insufficient and . . . the FAA failed in its duty to identify key safety problems,"" according to the report.

The FAA said the agency welcomes the scrutiny and the lessons from the two crashes would bolster aviation safety.

A Boeing spokesman said, ""We have cooperated extensively for the past year with the committee's investigation; we will review this preliminary report.""

The report offered fresh insight into Boeing's actions after the first crash in Indonesia. The panel concluded that Boeing continued to minimize the importance of MCAS -- and persisted in deflecting the need for additional pilot training -- even in the wake of the Lion Air crash in October 2018 and stepped-up FAA assessments of the system's hazards.

Based on hundreds of thousands of pages of internal documents and other material Boeing turned over to the committee, the report spells out steps Boeing took to defend itself in the weeks after the Lion Air crash. At the time, the report indicates, Boeing maintained that design changes that had made MCAS more powerful complied with all safety rules and requirements.

Despite the Lion Air crash and the public outcry it created, Boeing sought to persuade the FAA to downgrade training requirements on MAX jets in general, according to House investigators. Their report says the effort by Boeing came in the face of regulators' warnings that the company's technical evaluation of the issue was at odds with the views of FAA experts.

The Democratic-controlled House committee intends to continue its probe, but Rep. Peter DeFazio, the Oregon Democrat who chairs the panel, surprised some industry officials and prompted blowback from Republican members by opting to release a preliminary report. Coming days before the anniversary of the Ethiopian Airlines MAX crash in March 2019, Democrats hope the material will provide momentum for significant legislative changes tightening FAA oversight.

Rep. DeFazio sought to avoid a partisan rupture during the committee hearings. But hours after the report came out, a pair of senior GOP panel members issued a rebuttal suggesting its conclusions were premature and potentially biased. The Republican statement said other reviews of the FAA's approval process for new aircraft designs haven't concluded the ""system is broken or in need of wholesale dismantlement.""

Separately, in Boeing's latest reported production lapse, the FAA on Friday proposed a $19.7 million penalty against the company for installing unapproved sensors on nearly 800 jetliners, including 173 of its 737 MAX models.

The alleged missteps, extending from mid-2015 to the spring of 2019, highlight Boeing failures to comply with its own quality-control rules covering aircraft production. The proposed civil penalty also reflects increased FAA scrutiny of Boeing's assembly-line safeguards.

A Boeing spokesman said the company has done a thorough internal review and implemented changes to address the FAA's concerns.

World News: Gunmen Kill 32 at Afghanistan Political Gathering

KABUL -- Gunmen opened fire on a political gathering in Kabul on Friday, killing at least 32 and wounding 58, against a backdrop of tensions between the Afghan government and the U.S. over the Trump administration's plan with the Taliban toward ending 18 years of war.

Politicians, including the country's main opposition leader, scrambled for cover as gunmen targeted an outdoor event commemorating the 1995 killing by the Taliban of a revered local figure.

Abdullah Abdullah, the country's former chief executive, escaped unharmed, officials said.

The Taliban denied responsibility for the attack. Hours later, Islamic State claimed responsibility and said two of its fighters carried out the assault.

Some people speculated that the attack might have been an effort by insurgent spoilers trying to undermine the fragile U.S.-led efforts to end the war in Afghanistan.

The special U.S. envoy to the region is working to pave the way for breakthrough talks between the Taliban and Afghan government, set to begin Tuesday. But there were few signs that the scheduled talks would begin as planned.

On Feb. 29 the Trump administration signed a landmark deal with the Taliban that charts a course for the U.S. to pull all of its forces out of Afghanistan by July 2021.

The Pentagon has already given orders for the U.S. military to begin withdrawing forces from Afghanistan, where about 13,000 service members currently help train the country's military and carry out limited operations against Taliban, al Qaeda and Islamic State fighters.

The U.S.-Taliban deal calls for release of up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners as a precursor to Tuesday's talks. But Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has rebuffed appeals from the U.S. to release any prisoners as a good-faith gesture before the talks begin.

Zalmay Khalilzad, the special U.S. envoy who negotiated the deal with the Taliban, returned to Kabul this week to try to work out a compromise.

Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah remain at odds over the recent presidential election, which ended with the Afghan president securing a second five-year term. Mr. Abdullah has challenged the results and is preparing to hold a rival inauguration on Monday, on the same day as Mr. Ghani.

Earlier this week, Mr. Ghani declined to meet with Mr. Khalilzad, according to Afghan officials, creating more friction between Washington and Kabul.

On Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged ""all sides to stop posturing, start practical discussion about prisoner releases, knuckle down and prepare for the upcoming inter-Afghan negotiations.""

Earlier this week, the U.S. military in Afghanistan accused the Taliban of squandering an opportunity by stepping up their attacks on Afghan forces after signing the deal with the U.S. in Doha, Qatar.

Friday's violence rattled the Afghan capital. It took more than six hours for Afghan security forces to kill the gunmen, who were holed up in a nearby building. It couldn't be learned how many fighters were involved, but Afghan security forces said they killed two militants.

Omid Maisam, a deputy spokesman for Mr. Abdullah who was in the front row when the shooting started, said he took cover with other people behind a wall as the insurgents used rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns to target the gathering.

""It was such a horrific and terrible day,"" he said. ""I have lost many friends.""

Virus Darkens Economic Outlook --- Monthly U.S. jobs data again show strength, but forecasters see threat of 'vicious cycle'

Financial markets and economic forecasters are warning of rising risks for the U.S. and global economy, which were improving before the novel coronavirus spread from China around the world.

A buoyant U.S. job market had fueled strong consumer spending and cushioned the economy through choppy waters created by the trade war with China, a manufacturing contraction and weakening momentum abroad. But markets flashed warning signals this past week showing investors see dangers ahead, particularly in the bond market, with Treasury yields tumbling to historic lows, and in commodities, with crude prices on Friday logging their worst day since the financial crisis.

The U.S. labor market remains a bulwark, with employers adding a robust headcount of 273,000 last month, the Labor Department said Friday. But that will be tested as the virus spreads and governments try to contain it. China and Japan, the world's second- and third-largest economies, are already flirting with recession from the coronavirus shock. The U.S. is the largest world economy.

""The good news is the U.S. has a lot of momentum heading into this,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at accounting and advisory firm Grant Thornton. She expects the economy to slow sharply in the first half of 2020 but avoid a recession. ""The risk is this mutates into a more vicious cycle.""

Ms. Swonk projects U.S. economic growth to cool to a 0.5% annual pace in the first half -- a marked slowdown from last year's 2.3% expansion, which itself marked an easing from a more robust 2018. She expects layoffs at restaurants, hotels and airlines, and for the unemployment rate to edge up from a half-century low.

The widening impact of the spreading virus, including into financial markets, caused Oxford Economics economists to cut their global economic growth forecast further to 2% in 2020. ""The effects of financial market weakness and the disruption to daily life around the world will trigger lower consumer spending and investment on top of the disruptions to the global supply chain,"" said Ben May, Oxford's director of global macro research, in a note to clients.

The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said this past week its ""best case"" scenario would be for global economic growth to slow by a half-percentage point this year due to the epidemic.

The sectors where demand could suffer the most initially include air transportation, conference venues and hotels.

Southwest Airlines Co., which primarily flies domestic U.S. flights, said Thursday it has experienced ""a significant decline in customer demand"" and an increase in trip cancellations. United Airlines Holdings Inc., Germany's Deutsche Lufthansa AG and Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific Airway are encouraging employees to take unpaid leave at a time when airlines are reducing their flight schedules.

Restaurants, entertainment and retail -- industries that rely on discretionary spending and foot traffic -- also are at risk.

""Businesses that are primarily dine-in businesses may need to close temporarily if things get really bad,"" said Erik Herrmann, head of restaurant investment at CapitalSpring, which invests in and owns casual-dining restaurants. Mr. Herrmann expects drive-through services to benefit if the coronavirus spurs hesitancy among customers to eat inside restaurants.

United and Hyatt Hotels Corp. plan hiring freezes. General Motors Co. and Nestle SA are restricting employee travel. Events such as South by Southwest, a two-week tech, film and music festival in Austin, Texas, have been called off.

Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. have announced office closures in Seattle. While those high-tech workers can operate from home, Uber drivers and sandwich shops that served them could suffer.

""Workers can't all work from home, and you'll see lost output that can never be made up,"" Ms. Swonk said. ""You can't attend a canceled sporting event later and you won't buy a sweater you wanted in March in late April.""

One question for the U.S. is whether the impact spread to other business sectors. Manufacturers are reporting supply disruptions due to an extended shutdown of Chinese factories. Small businesses are concerned about whether they will have access to financing to bridge a slowdown in demand. And a temporary economic slowdown could put some heavily indebted firms at risk of default.

Before the market volatility, the U.S. economy was on a solid footing. In February, unemployment returned to a 50-year low and wages rose, the Labor Department said. Other recent readings showed layoffs at historic lows, steady consumer spending, low inflation and rising household income.

Then came the coronavirus. While the extent of economic harm isn't yet clear -- with damage contingent on how long it lasts, how widely it spreads and how people respond -- initial signs are already showing up.

Business activity by service providers contracted in February for the first time since October 2013, private data firm IHS Markit said Wednesday. Surveyed firms reported declining client demand and new business from abroad. The University of Michigan's gauge of consumer sentiment rose for all of February, but a fifth of respondents in the survey's closing days raised concerns about the coronavirus. The Institute for Supply Management said manufacturing activity cooled in February, as coronavirus effects rattled supply chains.

Products coming from China are facing backlogs, which weigh on U.S. sales. Keith McGee, owner of Black Sail Market LLC, said wait times for orders in China have recently grown to six weeks from two. Mr. McGee buys components from China and then assembles them into lights for the cannabis industry.

""I'm definitely starting to worry about it,"" he said. ""I can't afford to be running out of inventory for a month. It basically means I have no revenue.""

Crude prices notched the largest one-day decline since the recession on Friday after Saudi Arabia and Russia failed to agree on whether to reduce global supply in the face of the virus's effect on demand. Lower oil and gasoline prices could be a boon for U.S. consumers, though plunging prices could hurt parts of Texas and the Midwest where the local economies are increasingly tied to energy production.

Policy makers in the U.S. and abroad took steps this past week to blunt the impact, including an emergency half-percentage-point rate cut by the Federal Reserve and rate cuts in Canada and Australia.

The Fed has signaled it could cut rates further, but officials also have called for more government stimulus measures. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said Friday that a stronger fiscal-policy response is the ""obvious alternative"" to constrained monetary policy in the current low-rate environment.

President Trump signed an $8.3 billion emergency spending bill Friday to combat the virus, funding efforts to develop a vaccine and assisting local and state responses.

A much larger fiscal response may be needed, said Megan Greene, an economist at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. That could include reducing payroll taxes and providing more direct support to businesses and individuals, including steps such as loans and increased food-assistance payments.

EXCHANGE --- Visits to Epstein's Island Examined

U.K. investigators are examining visits by Barclays PLC Chief Executive Jes Staley to Jeffrey Epstein's private Caribbean island as part of a probe into whether Mr. Staley told the truth about his association with the convicted sex offender.

In a statement, a Barclays spokesman said Mr. Staley visited the island, Little St. James, twice, both times with his wife.

Neither the bank nor Mr. Staley had previously acknowledged the visits publicly.

Investigators are comparing disclosures Mr. Staley made to Barclays -- and which the bank subsequently made to U.K. financial regulators -- with a trove of emails and other documents handed over by Mr. Staley's former employer, JPMorgan Chase & Co., according to people familiar with the investigation.

Mr. Staley has said his relationship with Mr. Epstein was professional and began in 2000 when he was head of JPMorgan's private bank and the financier was a client.

He told journalists on Feb. 13 that his interactions with Mr. Epstein began to ""taper off"" after he left JPMorgan in 2013 and that the last time he had contact with him was in the ""middle to fall"" of 2015. He became Barclays CEO in December 2015.

""Mr. Staley visited Little St. James twice, accompanied by his wife on both visits,"" a Barclays spokesman told The Wall Street Journal. ""The visits to Little St. James, and his meetings at the Manhattan address where Epstein maintained an office, were disclosed to the board.""

The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority are examining ""Mr. Staley's characterization to the company of his relationship with Mr. Epstein and the subsequent description of that relationship in the company's response to the FCA,"" Barclays said in a Feb. 13 statement.

At that time, the Barclays board said Mr. Staley had been ""sufficiently transparent"" about the nature and extent of his relationship with Mr. Epstein.

The FCA, the U.K.'s financial watchdog, determines whether executives are ""fit and proper"" to lead.

Mr. Epstein pleaded guilty in 2008 to prostitution counts in Florida.

This year, prosecutors in the U.S. Virgin Islands, of which Little St. James is part, alleged Mr. Epstein abused hundreds of young women and girls until 2018. The prosecutors said that for nearly two decades, Mr. Epstein brought girls as young as 11 to his secluded property on Little St. James.

Mr. Staley had a large sailboat custom-designed, which he and his family have regularly taken to the Caribbean. He once took the boat to Mr. Epstein's island, Bloomberg has reported.

JPMorgan provided the emails and other documents to the FCA and regulators in other countries who were probing Mr. Epstein, according to people familiar with the situation.

Mr. Epstein was found dead in a Manhattan jail in August last year. His death was ruled a suicide.

U.S. News: Trade Gap Narrowed in January

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. trade deficit narrowed in January as trade flows with the rest of the world slowed during a month when the coronavirus's impact became more pronounced in China.

The foreign-trade gap in goods and services contracted 6.7% from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted $45.34 billion in January, the Commerce Department said Friday.

Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected a trade deficit of $46 billion.

Imports decreased 1.6% in January. Exports, meanwhile, slid by 0.4% from December. The decrease in imports reflected fewer purchases of industrial supplies, capital equipment and autos. Meanwhile, U.S. firms shipped fewer aircraft and less oil.

January presented a complicated international trade picture. The Lunar New Year halted production in China, as is typical, but those shutdowns were extended as the country sought to contain the new coronavirus outbreak. Late in the month, signs emerged that the virus could effect other parts of the world. In late January, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed the first U.S. case of the Covid-19 disease caused by the virus.

""The bottom line is Covid-19 supply chain uncertainty could create demand uncertainty as well,"" Richard Hayne, chief executive of clothing company Urban Outfitters Inc., said Tuesday.

The outbreak may have negated effects from the U.S. and China signing a mid-January agreement that amounts to a cease-fire in their two-year trade war. The deal leaves some tariffs on Chinese goods in place.

Also, January saw a halt in U.S. production of Boeing Co.'s troubled 737 MAX jetliner.

In the trade report for January, the U.S. deficit with China narrowed to a seasonally adjusted $23.67 billion, largely because imports from China into the U.S. fell sharply.

U.S. News: Trump Campaign's Media Libel Lawsuits Are Long Shots

A series of libel lawsuits filed by the Trump campaign against large media organizations are likely to run up against tough obstacles and depending on how far they progress, could subject the president to depositions, according to legal experts.

The Trump campaign's defamation claims against the New York Times on Feb. 26, the Washington Post on Monday and CNN on Friday appear to be unprecedented, legal scholars said. Courts have heard defamation lawsuits from governors, an ex-president and a presidential candidate, but legal scholars said they couldn't recall the last time a sitting U.S. president or his campaign elevated grievances against the news media into civil legal action.

The Trump campaign's initial lawsuits concerned two Post opinion pieces published in June 2019 and one in the New York Times in March 2019. Each contain passages implying Donald Trump sought or welcomed Russia's intervention in the 2016 presidential election or the 2020 race.

The Trump team's libel complaints continued Friday with a new lawsuit against CNN, alleging the campaign was defamed by a lengthy opinion article posted in June on CNN.com. The complaint focuses on a passage stating that the Trump campaign had ""assessed the potential risks and benefits of again seeking Russia's help in 2020 and has decided to leave that option on the table."" The lawsuit called the passage ""blatantly false."" A representative for the network declined to comment Friday.

The lawsuits demand millions of dollars in damages.

President Trump is entitled to the protections of libel law, but his campaign organization could have disadvantages as a plaintiff, legal scholars say.

When it comes to defamation litigation, public figures such as Mr. Trump must establish that not only was a statement false and defamatory, but that it was published with ""actual malice."" That means showing evidence that the people who wrote and edited the statement knew it was false -- or likely false but they didn't care to print the truth.

Each of the lawsuits emphasize that special counsel Robert Mueller's report on allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election found insufficient evidence that Mr. Trump and his campaign criminally conspired or coordinated with Russia. Suggestions to the contrary are damaging to the campaign's reputation and require expenditures to clear the record, the suits state.

Legal scholars said there is a crucial distinction between statements asserting facts and ones expressing opinions. Opinions are usually treated as protected speech, while an incorrect, defamatory fact isn't.

The Trump campaign declined to comment. Fred Ryan, publisher and chief executive of the Post, said the suits are an affront to the principles of press freedom. A spokeswoman for the Times said the Trump campaign is using litigation to ""try to punish an opinion writer for having an opinion they find unacceptable.""

Where Do the Candidates Stand on This Radical Immigration Plan?

Politicians used to write bills pandering to American voters in election years. Now a bill in the House panders to deported criminals living in foreign countries. Chicago-area Rep. Jesus ""Chuy"" Garcia and 44 Democratic co-sponsors -- including three other lawmakers from gang-ravaged Chicago -- recently introduced a radical immigration bill called the New Way Forward Act that seeks, as per a press release from Mr. Garcia, to ""disrupt the prison to deportation pipeline.""

The bill would make it more difficult for U.S. authorities to deport illegal aliens who commit felonies. It would roll back the federal statute that requires local authorities to cooperate and communicate with Immigration and Customs and Enforcement, making sanctuary cities legal. Its provisions would also help return already deported felons to the U.S.

Not long ago such a proposal would have been dismissed as too radical in the faculty lounge at Berkeley; today it is fast approaching the mainstream in the increasingly woke Democratic Party. Consider the bill's key points:

-- It would create a five-year statute of limitations for deportations and formally decriminalize illegal border crossings.

-- It would raise the minimum prison sentence needed to require deportation from one year to five, paving the way for illegal aliens convicted of serious crimes such as armed robbery, sexual assault, child molestation and manslaughter to remain in America.

-- It would repeal a law that bars entry to aliens who have committed crimes of moral turpitude -- depravity such as murder, voluntary manslaughter, rape, child molestation, kidnapping, assault and so on. Even multiple offenders would be permitted to enter under the bill.

-- It concludes by bestowing a ""right to come home"" to the U.S. at taxpayer expense on anyone deported after April 24, 1996.

The media, lurching leftward with the Democratic Party, has largely failed to scrutinize the bill. But it's a mistake to dismiss this as a fringe proposal that will never see the light of day.

Recall the first Democratic debate, when NBC's Savannah Guthrie asked the candidates to raise their hands if their health-care plans covered undocumented immigrants. Every candidate on stage put his hand up, including Joe Biden, who hesitated and looked as if he knew it was madness but he had to keep up. The show of hands illustrated how bad ideas can go from fringe to mandatory in a few years.

We don't have a clear idea of how many Democrats support it, but many prominent representatives do. There are the usual suspects -- ""the Squad,"" led by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as well as several lawmakers from districts with serious crime problems. There are also a couple of surprising co-sponsors, such as Madeleine Dean (D., Pa.) and Andy Levin (D., Mich.), who represent moderate districts.

What about the presidential candidates? The campaigns of Mr. Biden and Bernie Sanders didn't respond to requests for comment. Mr. Biden has said he will have a moratorium on deportations in his first 100 days if elected. He has also asserted that criminal aliens with drunk-driving-related felonies shouldn't be deported but is vague on details.

Mr. Sanders wants to decriminalize illegal border crossings, stop construction of what he calls a ""racist and ineffective wall,"" ""break up"" ICE and Customs and Border Protection, end workplace raids, and institute a moratorium on deportations. He also wants to ""repeal 1996 immigration laws"" intended to remove criminal aliens.

Why is the Democratic Party moving left on immigration when America elected a president who campaigned on building a wall? They might think they're courting the Latino vote, but many Latinos live in neighborhoods with crime problems. Mr. Garcia's heavily Latino district had 332 homicides in the past six years as of time of publication. The last thing people who live in violence-plagued neighborhoods need is a fresh infusion of deported criminals.

The media has a responsibility to pin the candidates down on issues like these, but too often reporters seem willing to save Democrats from themselves. If Democrats want to push for free return trips for deported criminals, let's make sure the American people know about it.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
The Senate and the Judiciary

Chuck Schumer says he regrets the words he used to threaten Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh last week, but perhaps we should thank him for the moment of candor. The Senate Minority Leader has reminded the country of the threat that a Democratic Senate poses to judicial independence.

Mr. Schumer's threats were cruder than most, but they are part of a larger Democratic-progressive project to politicize the judiciary and delegitimize the current Supreme Court. The effort has included opposing nearly all of Donald Trump's judicial nominees, threatening Justices with punishment if they issue certain rulings, stigmatizing judges who belong to the Federalist Society, and even threatening to change the structure of the High Court.

---

This goes well beyond the familiar criticism of Supreme Court rulings they don't like. And well beyond the popping off that President Trump has done about specific judges in specific cases. Mr. Trump is wrong to do so, but like so much of what he says it has had no legal effect. The judges ignore him, as they should, and so do Senate Republicans.

The GOP has reshaped the federal judiciary in the last three years the constitutional way. Mr. Trump has nominated competent judges, and the Senate has confirmed most of his choices. No one should be surprised since Mr. Trump promised to do this during the 2016 campaign, relying on the advice of conservative legal advisers.

Democrats are still angry that Mitch McConnell denied a Senate hearing to Merrick Garland, President Obama's nominee to replace Antonin Scalia, in 2016. That was political hardball. But no less than Mr. Schumer tipped in 2007 that he would have done the same had George W. Bush had a Supreme Court opening to fill in his final year as President.

""We should not confirm any Bush nominee to the Supreme Court, except in extraordinary circumstances,"" Mr. Schumer declared in a July 2007 speech to the American Constitution Society. Mr. McConnell followed that Schumer precedent. He gambled the seat on the results of the 2016 election, when voters knew the future of the courts was on the ballot.

That future is again at stake, and Senate control arguably matters more to the judiciary than does the presidential race. Even if Mr. Trump is re-elected, a Senate Democratic majority would end the confirmation of judges who believe in constitutional originalism. Senate Democrats would refuse to confirm anyone associated with the Federalist Society or other conservative groups. And a Democratic President and Senate might not settle merely for nominating and confirming liberal judges.

The best indicator of Democratic intent is Sheldon Whitehouse, the Rhode Island Senator famous for excavating Brett Kavanaugh's high-school yearbook. In January 2019, Mr. Whitehouse wrote to Chief Justice John Roberts to protest that the Court accepted friend-of-the-court briefs from ""special interest groups that fail to disclose their donors."" He said if the Court didn't cease and desist, ""a legislative solution may be in order."" That's a political threat.

Mr. Whitehouse repeated the charge last month in an amicus brief with three other Senators in a case challenging the structure of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The brief includes an appendix list of ""a small and powerful cabal of self-interested entities"" that dare to file amicus briefs disagreeing with Mr. Whitehouse on legal and policy issues.

Meanwhile, the Committee on Codes of Conduct of the U.S. Judicial Conference issued a draft opinion in January that would bar judges from belonging to the Federalist Society but not to the American Bar Association. A member of that committee is John McConnell, a federal district judge in Rhode Island who was promoted for the bench by none other than Sheldon Whitehouse.

In August last year, Mr. Whitehouse and four other Senators -- three on the Judiciary Committee as he is -- escalated the political intimidation. ""The Supreme Court is not well,"" they wrote in an amicus brief on a gun-regulation case. ""Perhaps the Court can heal itself before the public demands it be 'restructured in order to reduce the influence of politics.'""

---

What does ""restructured"" mean? It could mean packing the Court by creating seats for more than nine Justices. Democrats would have to kill the Senate's legislative filibuster so they could pass legislation without 60 votes. But that is what Senate Democrats did in 2013 to the filibuster rule for judicial nominees. They did so in order to pack the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals with a liberal majority to protect Mr. Obama's aggressive use of regulation.

Why would anyone think Senate Democrats wouldn't do it again if they had the power? Elizabeth Warren promised during her presidential campaign to kill the legislative filibuster, and the party's left might insist on it. One reason Mr. Schumer went off the deep end last week is that he knows he may face a primary challenge in 2022 from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Would he stand in the way of the Senate left on a filibuster change?

The Democratic goal here isn't merely to rebalance the courts with more liberal nominees the democratic way. The goal is to intimidate the judiciary into ruling the way Democrats want -- or else.

The Hachette Book Group announced last Monday that it would bring out ""Apropos of Nothing,"" a memoir by Woody Allen, in early April. CEO Michael Pietsch told an interviewer that the publisher ""believes strongly that there's a large audience that wants to hear the story of Woody Allen's life as told by Woody Allen himself.""

There was also a noisy audience that didn't -- and that didn't want anyone else to hear it either. Last Thursday Hachette employees staged a walkout to protest the book, and on Friday Hachette dropped it.

""The decision to cancel Mr. Allen's book was a difficult one,"" said a spokesman for the publisher. ""At HBG we take our relationships with authors very seriously, and do not cancel books lightly. We have published and will continue to publish many challenging books.""

My own interest in Woody Allen is approximately zero. I used to find him funny, but the prospect of wading through ""a comprehensive account of his life,"" as Hachette put it, fills me with gloom. Hachette had nonetheless determined that many readers would be interested in Mr. Allen's life story. They simply forgot to check with the feminist commissars to see if he passes muster in the age of #MeToo.

He doesn't, owing to an accusation that is more than a quarter-century old. In 1992, amid an ugly and public romantic split with actress Mia Farrow, he was accused of inappropriately touching their adopted daughter, Dylan Farrow, then 7. Connecticut State Police referred the case to the Yale New Haven Hospital Child Sexual Abuse Clinic, which concluded that ""Dylan was not sexually abused by Mr. Allen.""

The facts are somewhat murky. The state attorney declined to pursue the case, despite announcing that he had ""probable cause"" to do so. A judge denied Mr. Allen's claim for custody, cast doubt on the Yale report, and wrote that ""we will probably never know what happened,"" but Mr. Allen's behavior was ""grossly inappropriate.""

Dylan, now 34, has periodically revived the charge against her adoptive father, whose biological son, Ronan Farrow, has led the charge. Mr. Farrow has also been a leading #MeToo journalist, whose recent book, ""Catch and Kill,"" was published by another imprint at Hachette.

""Your policy of editorial independence among your imprints,"" Mr. Farrow wrote in an email to Mr. Pietsch last week, ""does not relieve you of your moral and professional obligations as the publisher of 'Catch and Kill,' and as the leader of a company being asked to assist in efforts by abusive men to whitewash their crimes.""

But there are no crimes, not even charges against Mr. Allen, only allegations. As the world saw during Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings, the principle of ""innocent until proven guilty"" has been replaced with ""innocent until accused.""

As for Hachette, it is happy to publish ""challenging"" books, but only within the ever-encroaching boundaries of political correctness. Trespass on that orthodoxy and watch the capitulation begin. As Groucho Marx is supposed to have said: ""These are my principles. If you don't like them -- well, I have others.""

The turmoil in global markets ratcheted up, with the prospect of an energy glut sparking steep selloffs in shares and oil, roiling currencies and fueling a stampede for the safety of government bonds.

Investors were responding to Saudi Arabia's decision to cut most of its oil prices and boost output, despite existing threats to demand from the coronavirus epidemic. The move escalates a clash with Russia.

""The fear today is about a global recession,"" said Thomas Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital, a hedge-fund-management firm based in New York. He said lower oil prices made it more likely some companies would default on their debts.

Trading in futures tied to the S&P 500 fell by the maximum 5% allowed in a single session, meaning trading was limited for the first time since shortly after President Trump won the U.S. presidential election in 2016.

U.S. government bonds, which have already rallied to record levels, extended gains. The yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note briefly fell below 0.5% and later stood at 0.516%.

In the Asia-Pacific region, the S&P/ASX 200 index in Australia dropped more than 5%. Japan's Nikkei 225 declined more than 6%, while benchmarks in Hong Kong and Shanghai dropped more than 3% and 2%, respectively.

The WSJ Dollar Index, a measure of the currency against 16 others, was down 0.4%.

Broken Hook Is Key to PG&E Case

A 3-inch hook purchased for 56 cents around the end of World War I could help determine whether PG&E Corp. faces criminal charges for starting the deadliest wildfire in California history.

Known as a ""C-hook,"" the badly worn piece of metal broke on Nov. 8, 2018, dropping a high-voltage electric line that sparked the Camp Fire, destroying the town of Paradise and killing 85 people.

PG&E has hundreds of thousands of hooks, manufactured by a number of companies, holding up power lines in its 70,000 square-mile-territory, but the utility doesn't have good data on how old they are, and is trying to replace many of them.

Whether PG&E was negligent in inspecting and replacing these hooks has emerged as a factor in a continuing California investigation that could determine whether the company and some of its former executives face criminal charges for their role in wildfires.

""They're excellent hooks if you don't leave them up in towers for 100 years,"" said Mike Ramsey, the district attorney of California's Butte County who is leading the investigation along with the state attorney general's office.

Mr. Ramsey's office sent pieces of the broken hook to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's laboratory in Quantico, Va., for forensic examination. He expects to make a decision soon on whether to charge PG&E, individuals at the company, or both.

The issue also has caught the attention of a federal judge overseeing PG&E's criminal probation from a safety-related violation stemming from a 2010 natural-gas explosion. The judge is demanding that the company produce more information on what it knows about the hooks and when it learned it.

U.S. District Judge William Alsup has asked PG&E dozens of questions about its hooks and inspection practices, and expressed concern that the company still wasn't doing enough to catch problems.

""You always fall back on: 'We do inspections, we do inspections.' But the inspections aren't working,"" he told the company in court.

A PG&E lawyer told Judge Alsup that since the Camp Fire, the company has replaced thousands of hooks, some of which had significant wear. The company said an untold number of worn hooks remain in use.

PG&E said its inspections have uncovered the need to replace thousands of hooks and other hardware showing wear or corrosion and that all of the highest-priority problems have been addressed.

The hooks, about the width of a fist, hang from the steel towers that support transmission lines, helping to hold the charged wires.

Windy conditions, over decades, can cause the hooks to rub against their hangers, which can erode the metal and increase the odds of failure. State investigators said they believed about 75% to 80% of the hook that caused the Camp Fire had worn away before it broke.

PG&E has a poor record of maintaining its transmission lines and steel towers, a Wall Street Journal investigation last year found.

PG&E internal documents show that it knew for years that many of its transmission towers had reached the end of their useful lives, the Journal reported last year.

In a 2017 internal presentation, the utility estimated that its transmission towers were an average of 68 years old. Their mean life expectancy was 65 years. The oldest steel towers were 108 years old.

Plagued by shoddy records and aging equipment, the company struggled to respond this past decade as drought and climate change made a tinderbox of its service territory and exposed the dangers of its power grid.

Its equipment sparked 18 deadly wildfires in 2017 and 2018, killing more than 100 people, state investigators say.

The company has agreed to a settlement with state regulators probing the cause of the Camp Fire after they found systemic problems with its inspection and maintenance practices.

The hook that failed in November 2018 was manufactured by Ohio Brass Co., a company that originally made metal harnesses for horse-drawn buggies before developing hardware for some of the first transmission lines ever built, according to court filings, historical documents and Mr. Ramsey.

A spokesman for Hubbell Inc., which purchased Ohio Brass in 1978, said the company was ""unable to identify the manufacturer of the hook in question.""

Photographs of hooks removed from the tower on the transmission line where the fire started show Ohio Brass markings.

Ohio Brass catalogs from that period reviewed by the Journal don't describe any warranties, and there is no evidence that metal hooks manufactured around 1918 were expected to last a century.

""I can tell you positively they had no idea"" how long they would last, said Doru Stefanescu, a professor emeritus of materials science at Ohio State University who is an expert in the kind of malleable iron used to make the hooks. Even today, he said, ""we don't have data to tell you what happens over 100 years.""

Court papers filed by attorneys representing fire victims suing PG&E for damages describe the hooks as ""all worn, rusted, and degraded."" PG&E inspectors, two months after the fire, noted in an inspection that a hook on the tower where the fire started ""is rusty and corrosion is set on.""

The line that sparked the Camp Fire, the Caribou-Palermo, is part of a transmission network known as the Caribou-Valona system, built around 1921 to carry hydroelectric power from the Sierra Nevada mountains to the Bay Area. Hundreds of its original steel towers are still in use.

PG&E has said in recent court filings it didn't track when its hooks were installed or how long they had been exposed to weather. It also didn't routinely inspect them to look for corrosion or wear. Before the Camp Fire, PG&E inspection forms didn't even include space to note the condition of hooks and other hardware.

There were reasons to be concerned about the condition of these hooks, records show.

In 1924, Ohio Brass stopped selling the type of malleable iron hooks that design documents indicate were used on the Caribou-Palermo just a few years earlier. Ohio Brass, switched to a new manufacturing method that produced iron ""freed from all tendency toward embrittlement when hot-dip galvanized,"" according to an article in the March 1926 edition of the Journal of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers.

In 1987, PG&E engineers noticed worn hooks on the southern portion of the 1921 transmission system. They requested tests on two hooks, which were supposed to hold up to 30,000 pounds. Both failed at 11,500 pounds. They then tested a third hook that didn't have any signs of wear. It failed at 6,900 pounds. One of the hooks was made by Ohio Brass while another was made by a different company, Lindsey Manufacturing Co., according to PG&E records.

The report concluded that PG&E should test more hooks to determine whether they were still dependable. In December, PG&E said in court filings it couldn't find any records related to further testing.

PG&E didn't routinely climb its transmission towers before the Camp Fire, instead inspecting them by ground or by air every five years. Since the Camp Fire, PG&E has rushed to inspect its entire electrical grid in search of other potentially dangerous problems. Inspectors last year spotted more than 5,000 high-priority safety hazards that hadn't been previously discovered.

Judge Alsup recently questioned PG&E's new inspection procedures after an expert hired by victims' attorneys testified that he spotted a worn hook on the Cresta-Rio Oso transmission line, which was built parallel to the Caribou-Palermo around 1928. The hook was a couple of hundred feet from the tower where the Camp Fire started.

Scott Hylton, a former Sacramento utility lineman, testified that after he first spotted the hook in the weeks following the fire, he assumed PG&E workers would replace it during inspections. When it was still there a year later, ""I felt an obligation to bring it forward to make sure it wasn't missed,"" he said.

PG&E inspectors had examined this tower twice last year, once by climbing it and once by drone. In court filings, the company said inspectors failed to spot the hook damage based on the photos they took. After looking again, they determined the hook was about 30% worn. PG&E's guidelines require it to replace hooks with 30% to 50% wear within a year -- or within six months if they are in fire-prone areas.

""If I had C-hooks that were 30% worn out, I'd replace them,"" Mr. Hylton said in court.

World News: Kremlin Scrutinized In Flight MH17 Trial

A Dutch court on Monday opens the trial of four men accused of helping move into Ukraine a Russian missile that shot down a passenger jet, killing all 298 on board and sparking international outrage.

Also on trial, unofficially, is the Kremlin.

The West blamed the 2014 shootdown of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 on Russia, which was pouring men and military equipment into eastern Ukraine in support of antigovernment forces, as part of its effort to keep Ukraine under Moscow's influence.

President Vladimir Putin has denied Russian military involvement in the six-year conflict or the downing of the plane. But the trial will make public evidence to the contrary -- including telephone intercepts and witnesses -- that could complicate renewed efforts to end the war. French President Emmanuel Macron has launched a new attempt to engage Mr. Putin, which has drawn criticism from some European officials who say it is premature.

Russia has criticized the investigation as incomplete and biased, blamed Ukraine for the shootdown, and provided a variety of unsubstantiated theories about what happened.

Petro Poroshenko, who was Ukrainian president when the plane was shot down near the eastern city of Donetsk, said the results of the lengthy investigation should expose the true nature of the Kremlin's military interventions in Ukraine and elsewhere.

""What will Putin do now? What about his claims that 'there are no [Russian soldiers] there'?"" Mr. Poroshenko said in an interview. ""It will be clear that he has been lying for six years.""

The downing of the plane, which was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on July 17, 2014, drew international condemnation of Russia and added momentum to sanctions against Moscow. The Netherlands, the country with the largest number of victims, took charge of the criminal investigation, supported by investigators from Australia, Belgium, Ukraine and Malaysia.

Prosecutors filed charges against four suspects, including three with ties to the Russian military and security services. They aren't expected to appear at the trial, as they are in Russia or in the part of Ukraine not controlled by Kyiv.

The suspects include Igor Girkin, a former colonel in Russia's Federal Security Service who was defense minister for the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, or DNR, at the time. He denies rebels shot down the plane.

Prosecutors say the suspects facilitated the transport of the missile, which they say came from Russia's 53rd Antiaircraft Missile Brigade. They have appealed for more witnesses and hope to charge other suspects, including the crew handling the missile and those who ordered them into Ukraine.

Investigators have made public parts of their investigation, including what they say are intercepted calls between Russian government officials and the leadership of the DNR in which they discuss administration, financing and military support from Russia. ""We now have the information, have the proof, that the Russian Federation is involved in this tragedy, in this crime, one way or another,"" lead prosecutor Fred Westerbeke said in June.

U.S. News: Big Tech Seeks Facial-Recognition Laws --- Companies push for nationwide rules as cities and states look at bans, severe curbs

WASHINGTON -- Amid rising calls for regulation, technology companies are pushing for laws that would restrict use of facial-recognition systems -- and head off the more severe prohibitions some cities and states are weighing.

Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc. and others stand to profit as government agencies and businesses expand use of the technology, which can require large investments in machine-learning and cloud-computing capacity.

That opportunity is threatened by campaigns to severely restrict its use.

San Francisco and six other cities have passed laws to block government use of facial recognition. Lawmakers in New York, Massachusetts, Hawaii and Michigan are considering some form of ban or strict limitation.

Pressed by advocacy groups, concert promoters Live Nation Entertainment Inc. and AEG Presents, which stages the Coachella Arts and Music Festival, say they don't have plans to use facial recognition at their events.

More than 60 college campuses have also disavowed the technology, activists say -- including the University of California, Los Angeles, which confirmed it nixed a proposal to link its security cameras to facial-recognition systems.

A coalition of 40 activist groups led by Fight for the Future is circulating ""Ban Facial Recognition"" petitions that call on lawmakers to block government agencies from any use of the technology. Erica Darragh of Students for Sensible Drug Policy, part of the coalition, says recruiting volunteers is a snap: ""Facial recognition freaks people out.""

If elected president, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders says, he would bar police from using it.

Against this backdrop, Microsoft is backing bills in Congress and in its home state of Washington permitting use of the technology with oversight.

""If we don't move past the polarizing debates that have blocked progress, people will continue to be left without any protection under the law,"" Microsoft President Brad Smith said.

The Washington state measures would allow facial recognition for specific uses such as investigating crime, controlling access to a building or identifying a ticket holder.

Amazon, the world's largest provider of cloud-computing services, declined to comment, but has said it supports national standards. International Business Machines Corp. has called for ""precision regulations"" that don't allow mass surveillance, and the CEO of Google owner Alphabet Inc. has said he is open to a temporary pause while regulations are developed.

Privacy advocates view industry-supported regulations as ploys to conduct business as usual.

""They are effectively geared to allow these companies to continue selling and profiting from these technologies, more or less unhindered,"" said Meredith Whittaker of New York University's AI Now Institute.

The market for technologies involving some form of facial recognition could be worth $14.5 billion in 2025, up from $2 billion last year, according to research firm Omdia.

Supporters see facial recognition as a means to keep intruders out of buildings, speed up entry lines at stadiums and airline gates, identify criminal suspects and locate missing children.

Opponents fear it will usher in a surveillance state. Participants in street rallies or public protests would lose their anonymity. Retailers could identify people entering their stores, possibly using it to monitor people with shoplifting convictions.

In the wrong hands, the technology could be used to target victims for financial scams, extortion or other schemes.

Studies also show that some facial-recognition systems are less accurate on nonwhite and female faces than on white males, although accuracy has been improving as the technology advances.

So far, law-enforcement agencies are among the biggest early adopters. One supplier, N.Y.-based Clearview AI Inc., says it has 2,000 active users at law-enforcement agencies, largely in the U.S. and Canada, including individuals who have been given a free trial.

New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal says Clearview's facial-recognition app helped officers identify suspected sexual predators in an online sting operation led by Somerset County.

Amid rising concerns however, Mr. Grewal in January imposed a statewide moratorium on Clearview's system until guidelines can be drafted. Even so, an outright ban would be ""an overcorrection that could potentially undermine public safety,"" he said in an interview.

Privacy advocates have raised concerns that Clearview hasn't submitted its algorithm for federal accuracy testing, as other companies have, and that the free trials it gives to police agencies don't go through the usual vetting for government contracts.

Critics also worry about Clearview's methods. It scrapes internet photo databases, including social-media posts. Other systems run narrower searches, like scanning mug shots.

That broader dragnet raises the risk of abuse, critics say -- enabling anyone with the Clearview app to take a photo of a stranger and potentially learn his or her identity and personal details.

Clearview CEO Hoan Ton-That says his firm compiles photos that are already public, and the technology is extremely accurate. Clearview limits use to law-enforcement and security professionals, he said in an interview, though he acknowledged potential investors have been given access.

For police, Clearview is ""only a lead, not a piece of evidence,"" and they still need to prove their cases in court, he said.

In Congress, members of both parties are discussing limits on federal use of the technology, including a pause on new uses, but haven't reached consensus.

""This technology is coming. What we should seek is a means by which to make sure that Big Brother is not coming"" along with it, said Rep. Clay Higgins (R., La.) at a Jan. 15 hearing of the House Oversight and Reform Committee.

One bill from Sens. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.) and Brian Schatz (D., Hawaii) would allow companies to use facial recognition with public notice, consent, and third-party testing. It has Microsoft's backing, but hasn't gained momentum.

Bills Advance in

Washington State

In Washington state, a bill from Democratic state Sen. Joe Nguyen aims to bar police from using facial recognition for broad surveillance.

Authorities could deploy it to identify suspects or track people suspected of felonies, but only after taking steps such as consulting the public and allowing third-party auditing.

""Technology itself is not what I'm scared of. I'm scared of how it's used,"" said Mr. Nguyen, who also is a senior program manager at Microsoft Corp.

A second Washington state bill on consumer-data privacy requires companies to post notice when they use facial recognition in public. The operator of a facial-recognition system would have to get permission before storing someone's likeness except when there is a ""reasonable suspicion"" the person was involved in a crime.

As the bills moved through the state Senate last month, Microsoft backed both. The Washington Association of Sheriffs & Police Chiefs opposed Mr. Nguyen's bill, calling it overly burdensome. The American Civil Liberties Union criticized both bills for legitimizing surveillance, saying the state should let municipalities make their own choices.

The state House passed different versions of the bills and lawmakers are negotiating.

Short-Term Loan Sector Worries Banks

Banks and other firms are growing cautious operating in short-term markets, a sign of the financial stress brought on by the coronavirus epidemic.

Short-term lending markets are the plumbing of the financial system, moving large volumes of cash from those who have it to those who need it. Confidence in their ability to function smoothly is integral to the performance of the wider financial system. Hiccups can lead to increased volatility and strain.

One area of recent note is the market in which firms borrow and lend cash through agreements to repurchase Treasury securities. Rates in the repo market are measured against the Federal Reserve's short-term benchmark. Last week the difference between the two, or the spread, widened to levels not seen since November.

The repo market is where firms such as hedge funds borrow to finance their investments and money-market funds earn returns on piles of cash. It also supports bank operations that include extending near-term loans to corporate clients.

At the same time, a measure of the premium investors will pay for dollars -- known as the cross-currency basis -- increased for the first time in years. Traders and salespeople at Barclays PLC, UBS Group AG and Morgan Stanley said such a move usually reflects a shortage of dollars available, a circumstance that was last acute when a sovereign-debt crisis gripped Europe in 2011.

""Dollar funding is always the orphaned child of crises as the regions where the pressures flare up have no control over it,"" said Credit Suisse Group AG analyst Zoltan Pozsar. Investors often use dollars to fund foreign investments.

Additionally, traders at large asset-management firms said they are having more trouble trading a variety of financial instruments, from corporate bonds to derivatives. One said the difference between what buyers wanted to pay and what sellers were willing to receive for investment-grade bonds is widening, with banks less willing to take on risk.

Some are even beginning to ""fade"" trades -- industry parlance for backpedaling from agreed-upon deals.

The pain is also being felt in the Treasury market, where high-frequency trading algorithms have pulled back as volatility increased. According to Priya Misra, head of rates strategy at TD Securities, liquidity in the Treasury market is bifurcated and stressed because of this phenomenon.

""When volatility picks up, the high-frequency traders step away,"" said Ms. Misra. ""It's not a deep market.""

Investors and bankers are concerned enough that they are studying options the Fed could take to ease jumpy markets that go beyond rate cuts. Many traders believe such cuts are an inadequate tool to fix a problem rooted in short-term supply-chain shocks that could leave companies short of cash to make payments on debt and other obligations.

""During the financial crisis, the Fed didn't employ the same cookie-cutter responses that central banks in the 1980s used,"" said Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed-income at BlackRock Inc. ""The market will react to innovative ideas that are targeted at stabilizing the near-term problem.""

Mr. Rieder said the Fed could purchase longer-dated assets as it did in some post-financial-crisis operations, or buy municipal bonds, mortgages and other unconventional assets.

""I don't think they need to execute that sort of option today, but overall the Fed has tremendous leeway to operate in,"" he said.

Such possibilities aren't just idle trader talk. Federal Reserve Bank of Boston President Eric Rosengren said Friday that to provide stimulus, the Fed may need the power to buy a broader array of bonds beyond Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities.

Operational risks posed by the coronavirus are an additional source of worry. Banks and investment firms could be forced to close central trading hubs and scatter employees to remote locations, some of which hadn't been tested for some time until last week.

If financial institutions begin implementing contingency plans that make trading more difficult because traders are working remotely or from multiple backup locations, ""the possibility for some kind of operational slowdown or malfunction gets high,"" said Nellie Liang, a former senior Fed economist who is now at the Brookings Institution.

Some smaller broker-dealers are extending overnight repo trades into the future, as evidenced by an esoteric measure called the general collateral term structure. This is presumably to reduce risks associated with large dealers asking employees to work elsewhere, said Josh Younger, head of interest rate derivatives strategy at JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Banks spent the past week ratcheting up plans to prevent the coronavirus from rapidly spreading among employees. Morgan Stanley, UBS and JPMorgan are among banks splitting global markets workforces into groups working out of locations spanning from Stamford, Conn., to Edison, N.J., -- or remotely from home.

At Goldman Sachs Group Inc., a group of traders would remain in the firm's downtown Manhattan headquarters -- but scattered between empty desks to avoid contamination -- while others would move to remote locations, a person familiar with the matter said.

Business News: Boeing CEO Regrets Candor

Boeing Chief Executive Dave Calhoun told executives that he regretted voicing criticisms of the company's leadership and former CEO in a recent interview with the New York Times.

Mr. Calhoun, who started as CEO in January, is dealing with the fallout of his candid assessment of Boeing's problems, telling executives they have his support despite sometimes harsh comments published in the article.

""I am both embarrassed and regretful about the article,"" Mr. Calhoun wrote in a message addressed to Boeing senior leaders, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. ""It suggests I broke my promise to former CEO Dennis Muilenburg, the executive team and our people that I would have their back when it counted most. I want to reassure you that my promise remains intact.""

Mr. Calhoun, who served on Boeing's board for about a decade before being appointed CEO, had vowed to make a fresh start for the beleaguered company. He has said he planned to focus on rebuilding trust in the company and being more transparent.

Boeing has been in crisis since two of its 737 MAX planes crashed within a five-month period, killing 346 people. The MAX has been grounded world-wide since last March and Boeing had to shut down production of the plane this year. The crashes have drawn scrutiny of the plane maker's engineering culture and damaged the company's relationships with suppliers, customers and regulators.

In a preliminary report released Friday, House investigators said production pressures, faulty assumptions, and a ""culture of concealment,"" combined with insufficient federal safety oversight, led to the two crashes.

Separately, in Boeing's latest reported production lapse, the Federal Aviation Administration on Friday proposed a $19.7 million penalty against the company for installing unapproved sensors on hundreds of planes, including some MAX jets. A Boeing spokesman said the company has done a thorough internal review and implemented changes to address the FAA's concerns.

Mr. Calhoun told the New York Times that the challenges he is facing are more than he'd anticipated, according to the March 5 article. ""And it speaks to the weaknesses of our leadership,"" he said.

He said Mr. Muilenburg may have increased production of the 737 MAX too quickly at the expense of quality. Mr. Calhoun suggested that Mr. Muilenburg had been chasing a higher share price, according to the article.

""I'll never be able to judge what motivated Dennis, whether it was a stock price that was going to continue to go up and up, or whether it was just beating the other guy to the next rate increase,"" Mr. Calhoun said, adding that the board had trusted Mr. Muilenburg and his proven record of taking risks that had paid off.

Mr. Muilenburg couldn't be reached for comment.

Mr. Calhoun publicly expressed support for Mr. Muilenburg in the months leading up to his removal in December, but the board eventually became frustrated with Mr. Muilenburg's overly optimistic projections and convinced that he had mismanaged the company's relationship with the FAA, potentially complicating the plane's return to service, people familiar with the matter have said.

Mr. Calhoun had become more engaged in managing the company after being made chairman in October, when the board stripped Mr. Muilenburg of that role, but has sought to draw a clean break from the company's past missteps.

""I watched the same movie you did -- I think I was in the front-row seat, and I might come to exactly the same conclusions you do,"" Mr. Calhoun said in a call with reporters in January. ""My leadership role here at Boeing is intended to make changes that correct a lot of those situations.""

A Boeing spokesman said Mr. Calhoun wanted to provide Boeing executives with more context about what he had said in the interview.

""It is important to Dave that his teammates have a full understanding of his views and the context they were given in,"" a Boeing spokesman said. ""And like many interviews, not everything makes it into the story, and Dave wanted to share some of the points he made about the good work of our team and the strength of our portfolio of products and services.""

In the message on Friday, Mr. Calhoun said he had wanted to speak candidly about the company's challenges, but hadn't intended to undermine its current leadership team.

He said he was invested in Mr. Muilenburg's success, and that the disappointments he discussed in the interview mostly related to the company's failure to return the plane to service going into the fourth quarter.

""Now is not the time to look behind us. I regret doing it. Now is the time to look forward and build on our foundation,"" he wrote.

Mr. Calhoun said he maintained his commitment to being more transparent.

""I have said that transparency is a messy process but worth it in the end, and I still believe it.""

How to Ease the Coronavirus Panic

The spread of the new coronavirus has already wreaked economic havoc. China's economy virtually came to a standstill in February. Elsewhere, tourist and business travel has collapsed, conferences and sporting events are being canceled, and supply chains for the production of goods have been hit. These demand and supply-side shocks -- and the expectation of more to come -- have led to panic in the financial markets. In the past two weeks, equity markets have fallen steeply and volatility has soared, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield has collapsed to an all-time low, and liquidity in the market for U.S. government securities -- normally the world's most liquid market -- has dried up.

These knee-jerk reactions are understandable. After all, nobody can know the duration and course of this scourge, and markets hate uncertainty. But if one takes a longer view with clear eyes, the American economy is in good shape. The longest expansion in U.S. history is set to continue. Balance sheets are sound, and there is ample monetary support for continued growth. The broad money supply measured by Divisia M4 is growing at an annual rate of 6.9%, up from 4.2% a year earlier.

Asia is the epicenter of the Covid-19 outbreak. It's also the epicenter of the supply-chain problems. Supply chains are nothing more than payment chains in reverse. Typical supply chains consist of a supplier of raw materials, a maker of basic industrial goods, a manufacturer of semifinished or partly assembled items, and the maker and distributor of final products. At each stage there is a payment flowing in the other direction.

Key links in the physical supply chains are heavily concentrated in Asia. Trade finance -- the ""financial supply chain"" -- which underpins the production supply chains, is U.S. dollar-denominated and supplied by banks in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China and Hong Kong. But these Asian banks' access to dollar funding is limited. When dollar-funding stresses occur in Asian financial markets, they ricochet toward U.S. banks and finally to the Federal Reserve as the ultimate supplier of dollars or dealer of last resort.

These funding problems have already started to show up in the U.S. money markets. The term repo auction conducted by the New York Fed on March 5 was three times oversubscribed. Bids were $72.55 billion compared with the $20 billion offered. In other words, dealers are concerned that over the next two weeks they may need cash to meet demand from their correspondent banks in Asia or to ensure they can bid in the coming U.S. Treasury auctions.

How should the Fed respond? Last Tuesday the Federal Open Market Committee decided to cut the range for the fed-funds rate by 50 basis points. The world's major central bankers and commentators fetishize interest rates. They cheered the Fed's move because they believe that changes to interest rates are an indicator of the central bank's monetary-policy stance. In times of trouble, they think, lower fed-funds rates are countercyclical and therefore desirable. But now the central bankers think they are out of, or nearly out of, ammunition, since interest rates are near zero, or even negative. In an unexpected twist, central bankers have become the loudest proponents of fiscal stimuli.

The focus on interest rates originated with John Maynard Keynes and has been propagated by antimoney Keynesians ever since. Consider: During the Depression, the Fed's discount rate was 6% when the stock market crashed in October 1929. By April 1931, it had plunged to 1.5%. This signaled to many that monetary policy had been loosened. But interest rates weren't the only things plunging. So was the money supply, indicating that monetary policy was actually too tight. Interest rates as a gauge of the Fed's monetary-policy stance were -- and are -- no better than flying blind.

Monetary policy today has become detached from reality and the needs of markets. It is driven by misleading theories about what interest rates can achieve. Contrary to popular belief and the wisdom of crowds, monetary policy isn't about interest rates. It is about providing the right amount of funding -- the right quantity of money.

The right response to the current volatility is to follow Walter Bagehot's classic dictum: Supply ample funds at a penalty rate against decent collateral. In other words, the Fed needs to supply liquidity to deal with the panic -- whether by quantitative-easing purchases of long bonds, by Treasury bill purchases, by repos or, most important, by increasing the amounts of U.S. dollar swaps available to the central banks of Japan, China, South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong.

If the Fed acts to remove the financial stresses in the market via liquidity injections, the panic will subside and a recession can be avoided. The injections can then easily be withdrawn so that they don't later generate inflation.

Though the coronavirus pandemic poses serious short-term problems, it need not exacerbate the financial panic or tip the global economy into a recession. But the right strategy is crucial. The Fed and other central banks must let go of their interest-rate fetish. They must do what central banks have traditionally done to tamp down and extinguish panics. Ample liquidity -- read: money -- must be supplied at penalty rates.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
The Fed's Market Emollients

A decade of relative market calm may have caused some folks to forget that financial panics happen, and that's one reason the Federal Reserve exists. Amid the coronavirus contagion and now an oil price shock, the Fed may need to break out its 2008 medical kit to supply liquidity to fainting financial markets.

Jolts in asset and commodity prices along with worries about corporate-debt defaults are spooking markets, to put it mildly. The New York Fed on Monday said it planned to increase its daily overnight repo lending operations to $150 billion from $100 billion and raise its two-week repos to $45 billion from $20 billion. This is helpful. An immediate liquidity injection will arguably do more to ease credit conditions than another interest-rate cut with the effective fed funds rate already at 1.09% and the 10-year Treasury yield below 0.6%.

But the Fed may have to do more, starting with extending foreign-exchange swap lines with other central banks. These reciprocal lines were established after the 2008 crisis to improve liquidity in global financial markets. They let foreign central banks tap U.S. dollars to provide liquidity to their own financial institutions in addition to local currencies.

The Fed currently has swap arrangements with the central banks of Canada, U.K., European Union, Switzerland and Japan. It could extend these swap lines to other countries with markets in tumult like Australia, South Korea, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Foreign central banks should also be encouraged to supply dollars to their banks if needed.

Since the financial crisis, banks have been required to hold enough high-quality assets that they can liquefy during periods of financial stress -- like now -- to meet funding obligations. But the Fed's preference for cash to Treasurys has encouraged cash hoarding. The Fed could encourage more repo market lending by communicating that it considers Treasurys on par with cash.

The Fed could also assure banks that the discount window is available to liquefy Treasurys on demand if they need cash. Many banks in good financial condition during the 2008 crisis were reluctant to borrow from the discount window because they worried investors and other institutions would perceive that as a sign the bank was in trouble.

The financial system is sturdier now, but this stigma is also why the Fed established term-funding auctions. Under the two-year program, the Fed auctioned 28- and 84-day loans to banks in sound condition. The auctions gave the Fed more flexibility than traditional open-market operations and reduced the stigma associated with borrowing from the discount window. Other crisis-era tools to increase liquidity could be revived if needed.

Some of our friends are also calling on the Fed to revive its bond purchases known as quantitative easing. That seems premature. Government debt and mortgage purchases after the crisis were intended to stimulate the equity markets by driving investors into riskier assets and pushing down long-term bond rates. But the operations have been hard to wind down and may have caused credit distortions. It's also hard to push the 30-year bond much lower than its close Monday of 1.02%.

Unlike in 2008, the U.S. economy was strong going into the coronavirus contagion and now an oil shock. Public-health measures are still the real cure. But the Fed can reassure financial markets and ease credit conditions by fulfilling its mission as a supplier of liquidity in jittery times.

World News: Two Soldiers Are Killed in Raid on ISIS

BEIRUT -- Two American soldiers were killed during a raid on an Islamic State hideout in the mountains of central Iraq, highlighting the continuing security partnership between Baghdad and Washington despite strained relations.

The U.S.-led coalition said the two service members were killed while advising and accompanying Iraqi security forces on the mission on Sunday.

Iraq's elite counterterrorism service said 25 militants had been killed in the raid in the Qarachogh mountains. Coalition aircraft carried out repeated strikes while Iraqi soldiers clashed with Islamic State from Sunday until dawn on Monday, the service said, adding that nine tunnels and an Islamic State training camp were also destroyed.

Islamic State lost the last of its territory last year following a multiyear campaign by Iraqi and Syrian forces backed by the U.S.-led coalition. The group's leader, Abu-Bakr al-Baghdadi, was killed in a raid in Syria by U.S. special-operations forces in October.

But the group remains active in Iraq's ungoverned rural areas, mountains and deserts where security forces are stretched thin. The mountains in central Iraq have long provided a haven for militants because of the rough terrain and the gap they create between Iraqi security forces and the Kurdish forces that control the north of the country.

U.S. and Iraqi military commanders have warned that growing disorder in Iraq and the region could undermine the gains made in the war against Islamic State.

The coalition of U.S. and allied foreign troops suspended operations in Iraq in January amid a surge of anti-American sentiment after the killing of a prominent Iranian general by the U.S. in Baghdad. In response, the Iraqi parliament voted in favor of expelling U.S. troops from the country, plunging relations with Washington into crisis.

Joint operations have since resumed, and the push to expel U.S. forces lost some momentum under threat of U.S. financial penalties along with wrangling over the formation of a new Iraqi government. The coronavirus outbreak is further drawing attention away from the issue.

Rout Tightens Squeeze on Europe's Banks

Monday's market convulsions heaped more pressure on Europe's limping lenders, as they scramble to help customers cope with the impact of the coronavirus.

Banks are extending special measures to customers whose businesses are stretched because of the spread of the virus amid unprecedented moves across almost every asset class in recent days. It is the latest challenge for lenders already struggling with negative interest rates and sluggish growth across the region.

The special measures -- such as deferring mortgage repayments, extending credit lines and offering bridging loans to those in need -- are now set against a backdrop of sharp falls in stock markets, surging demand for Treasurys, plunging oil prices and wild swings in currency markets.

Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, a U.K. lender of which the British government owns 62% after it provided a taxpayer-funded bailout in the last financial crisis, pledged GBP 5 billion ($6.5 billion) in working capital Monday for companies affected by the virus outbreak.

The uncertainty ""is unprecedented even by recent standards,"" RBS Chief Executive Alison Rose said. ""We are here to support and can help businesses manage any short term disruption.""

The share prices of European banks have been battered as the virus spread across the continent. The Stoxx Europe 600 Banks index has plummeted 30% in the past three weeks. The banks' cost of funding has almost doubled in the past few weeks and is now at levels not seen since 2013, when Europe was dealing with a debt crisis, according to Tom Kinmonth, a fixed-income strategist at Dutch lender ABN AMRO Bank NV.

Investors worry that as economic activity falls, companies will struggle to fulfill their debt obligations, pay workers and keep their businesses alive. Banks sold off again Monday, part of the broader market rout.

A rise in defaults would immediately hit banks, which would have to assume losses at a time when many in the region are reporting low profits because of negative interest rates and anemic growth.

Eurozone government officials, banking authorities and other regulators have met over recent days to discuss ways to help small and midsize companies facing liquidity crunches, including through state guarantees, tax deferrals and incentives for banks to lend more, according to people familiar with the talks. European Union officials are also looking into state aid rules and how they might offer temporary exemptions to allow for greater government assistance.

Europe's main banking supervisor, an arm of the European Central Bank, has asked banks to present plans to continue operating in case the virus outbreak escalates. It is also paying close attention to how credit quality evolves, a person familiar with the situation said.

While banks wait for broad measures, some are trying to ease the pain for borrowers before it gets worse.

In Italy, which extended its quarantine measures to the whole country on Monday night, UniCredit SpA, the country's biggest bank, said it would provide a 12-month moratorium on mortgage repayments for retail clients and companies in some municipalities.

In Germany, where cases have been lower but companies are getting hit by the severe slowdown in China, a big trading partner, UniCredit's German unit said it is offering interim financing, bridging loans and extended payment periods to those affected.

Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government announced limited measures Monday to help companies deal with the epidemic, including boosting subsidies to keep employees on reduced hours instead of laying them off in times of crisis. Troubled companies will also be able to access cheap loans and guarantees from state-owned banks.

In the U.K., clients of Lloyds Banking Group PLC that have supply-chain problems can ask for working-capital support, a spokeswoman for the London bank said.

""Barclays is ready to help, whether that's with managing cash flow or any other support,"" Ian Rand, head of Barclays PLC's business banking unit, said.

Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney and European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde have both indicated that they are prepared to act.

""The Bank of England's role is to help U.K. businesses and households manage through an economic shock that could prove large but will ultimately be temporary,"" Mr. Carney said in a speech in London Thursday. ""Our policy arsenal includes monetary policy instruments, special liquidity facilities, and macroprudential tools.""

In Frankfurt, the ECB is ready ""to take appropriate and targeted measures, as necessary and commensurate with the underlying risks,"" Ms. Lagarde said in a statement on the website of the eurozone's central bank.

Among the ECB's options is a further cut in interest rates, which are already below zero. The central bank is likely to announce its next policy steps at a news conference on Thursday.

U.S. News: Ex-CIA Staffer Guilty of Lesser Charges

A federal jury couldn't reach a verdict on whether a former software engineer for the Central Intelligence Agency was responsible for leaking a trove of classified documents to WikiLeaks, convicting him instead on lesser charges stemming from the leak.

Joshua Schulte, 31 years old, was convicted of making false statements and contempt of court -- charges that related to Mr. Schulte's conduct after the March 7, 2017, publication of the CIA materials, dubbed Vault 7 by WikiLeaks. The jury said Monday they were deadlocked on the remaining eight counts, including the illegal gathering and transmission of national defense information.

The hung jury, following a week of jury deliberations, marks a blow to the Justice Department in its crackdown on government leaks. One former top CIA official who testified called the leak ""the equivalent of a digital Pearl Harbor.""

The government could choose to prosecute Mr. Schulte again on the deadlocked charges.

A spokesman for the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, which brought the charges, declined to comment on the verdict. Lawyers for Mr. Schulte declined to comment.

During the four-week trial in Manhattan federal court, prosecutors presented witness testimony, internal CIA communications and computer records in an attempt to show that Mr. Schulte stole the top-secret materials and gave them to WikiLeaks in 2016. At the time, he was a disgruntled employee in the CIA unit that designed the agency's hacking tools.

In cross-examinations of government witnesses, Mr. Schulte's lawyers sowed doubt about the government's case, suggesting that the CIA had pinned the embarrassing leak on Mr. Schulte because he was a difficult employee who had antagonized his colleagues and superiors.

On Friday afternoon, the jury -- made up of just 11 jurors, after one was dismissed during deliberations last week for reading news coverage of the case -- sent a note to U.S. District Judge Paul A. Crotty saying they were ""aligned on two counts"" but at an ""impasse on the remaining counts.""

On Monday morning, Judge Crotty agreed to receive the verdict on two counts and declare a mistrial on the remaining counts.

In all, the jury deadlocked on eight counts: three counts related to the gathering and transmission of national defense information, two counts of unauthorized access to a computer to obtain information, one count of theft of government property, one count of transmission of a harmful computer program or code and one count of obstruction of justice. The judge dismissed an 11th count before the jury began deliberations last week.

WASHINGTON -- The spread of the coronavirus and related economic uncertainty is threatening to undermine the ""phase one"" trade agreement that the Trump administration signed with its Chinese counterparts less than two months ago.

President Trump, who repeatedly has criticized the U.S. trade deficit with China, made purchase commitments by China a core part of the deal, with Beijing expected to buy $200 billion in additional American exports over two years. An extra $77 billion is required in 2020 and $123 billion in 2021.

Yet, the virus's spread has hurt Chinese economic demand and trade, and the ensuing drop in global-energy prices and weakness in the transportation sector make it unlikely China will be able to make good on the dollar commitments in the deal, economists and trade experts say.

On Monday, the Center for Strategic and International Studies released a report saying that the purchase targets already were overly ambitious -- and that the coronavirus has worsened the situation.

""Not only are the numbers unrealistic, but they're unreal,"" said Scott Kennedy, China expert at the nonpartisan Washington think tank. ""The likelihood of even just reaching last year's exports is unlikely.""

Trump administration officials previously acknowledged that the coronavirus-related problems may delay expected purchases by China this year, but said Chinese President Xi Jinping had assured Mr. Trump the country would meet its obligations.

Trade experts have pointed to a clause in the deal that allows for consultations ""in the event that a natural disaster or other unforeseeable event outside the control"" of the countries delays implementation.

The office of U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, which is responsible for implementing the agreement, said it ""has had no conversations like this with our Chinese counterparts.""

""We expect that the Chinese will meet their commitments under the agreement,"" a spokesman for Mr. Lighthizer said. The Chinese embassy in Washington didn't respond to a request for comment.

""China realizes very clearly there is a lot of skepticism on the U.S. side on whether they will follow through and they are doing all they can to put that to rest,"" said Clete Willems, a law partner at Akin Gump and former Trump administration trade official.

Mr. Trump has been generally complimentary of China's handling of the crisis, a characterization that is at odds with some fellow Republicans, who have questioned whether China has been transparent.

A Republican with close ties to the administration believes Mr. Trump is proceeding carefully to avoid giving Beijing an excuse to back out of its commitments. ""He thinks that if he starts beating up China they are going to stiff him,"" this person said. The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.

Current and former administration officials have tended to be optimistic about Beijing's ability to catch up on the requirements of the pact, noting that Mr. Xi has enormous influence over state-owned enterprises that could purchase American aircraft, energy products and farm goods.

Still, the deal's reliance on state-led firms to purchase U.S. products -- often with expensive and enduring tariffs that make them less attractive -- brings its own set of problems, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, another Washington think tank.

""It will be hard enough for China to meet this commitment as it stumbles through an economy now afflicted by the coronavirus disease,"" economists Chad Bown and Mary Lovely said last week.

China on Saturday posted a 4% drop in imports in the first two months of the year, compared with a year earlier. Still, the country's pork, soybean and natural-gas imports grew.

U.S. officials have been touting other aspects of the deal, including Beijing's moves to open up to American chicken exports and pave the way for better protection of intellectual property in China. The emphasis on purchases in phase one differed sharply from recent Washington trade pacts, which typically prioritize lifting barriers to facilitate freer, market-based trade.

Mr. Lighthizer and U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue are expected to announce Tuesday further progress in implementing the deal, including opening its markets to California nectarines and lifting bans on beef from older cattle.

In addition to the purchases, China agreed to discourage theft of trade secrets and safeguard intellectual property in the phase-one accord, among other pledges.

At a recent rally, Mr. Trump said the U.S. economy remains strong, but is ""nothing compared with what it's going to be when the trade deals kick in."" Still, the bigger shifts in economic rules that officials had hoped Beijing would agree to were left for future negotiations.

UAW Probes Sexual-Harassment Claims

The United Auto Workers has hired an outside lawyer to investigate allegations that a member of the union's executive board sexually harassed female staffers under his supervision, according to people familiar with the inquiry.

Two current female UAW staffers have alleged that Richard Rankin, a regional director who holds a powerful position on the union's governing board, repeatedly made sexually charged remarks that in one instance escalated to a physical threat, the people close to the inquiry say.

UAW leaders have tapped an attorney from the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Bredhoff & Kaiser PLLC to conduct an independent investigation into the women's claims, the people said.

The investigation began in January after a group of UAW-represented nurses filed a separate formal grievance to the union's board involving Mr. Rankin last fall that also contains allegations of sexual harassment, some of these people say.

The UAW confirmed to The Wall Street Journal in a statement that it has hired an outside attorney to investigate claims of discrimination and harassment in region 2B, the division overseen by Mr. Rankin, and that probe is ongoing. The union's statement didn't name Mr. Rankin.

""If we find that there was misconduct in the workplace, we will take appropriate corrective action,"" the UAW said.

Mr. Rankin, in an emailed statement, said: ""I support and have fully cooperated with the investigation into this matter and with the investigation process.""

The harassment allegations represent the latest challenge for UAW leaders, who are already grappling with a yearslong federal investigation into corruption that prosecutors say could result in federal oversight of the labor union.

The government's probe, which first became public in 2017, has led to the convictions of several former senior UAW officials, including three ex-board members.

The UAW has said it is enacting reforms, and that those charged in the probe violated the trust of its members.

On Thursday, federal prosecutors said they had charged former UAW President Gary Jones with conspiracy to embezzle more than $1 million from union funds. Mr. Jones, who resigned in November after leading a 40-day strike at General Motors Co., is the highest-ranking UAW official to be charged in the criminal probe.

An attorney for Mr. Jones declined to comment.

The two women have told the independent attorney the alleged incidents spanned a four-year period, starting in 2015, and that when they reported the claims to senior UAW officials, Mr. Rankin retaliated against them, people close to the inquiry say.

The UAW is separately reviewing the nurses' grievance, which alleges in part that Mr. Rankin, along with another male UAW official, ""repeatedly sexually harassed and discriminated against"" female leaders of the union local, according to a copy reviewed by the Journal.

The UAW is addressing those allegations through its formal grievance process, which is separate from the independent investigation, according to people familiar with the matter.

One of the nation's most prominent unions, the UAW represents roughly 400,000 active members, including factory workers at General Motors, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Ford Motor Co. While the 84-year-old union has its roots in the automotive business, it now represents workers in a broader array of industries, including higher education, health care and gambling.

UAW President Rory Gamble, who took over late last year, has pledged to root out financial and ethical wrongdoing at the union, including instituting reforms that he says aim to prevent the kind of financial misconduct uncovered by federal investigators.

A native of Youngstown, Ohio, Mr. Rankin was elected two years ago to lead the UAW's region 2B, which covers the states of Ohio and Indiana and represents workers at more than 50 companies, including all three Detroit auto makers. That role gives Mr. Rankin significant power on the union's executive board, where directors' votes are weighted proportionately to the number of workers they represent.

The UAW's executive board is a 13-member governing body, responsible for day-to-day operations of the union and executing on programs and policies approved by members.

In late 2017, then-UAW President Dennis Williams said: ""Let me be very clear about this: the UAW has a policy of no tolerance -- zero tolerance -- when it comes to sexual harassment."" He left the post in 2018.

The expanding federal corruption investigation, which in recent months has resulted in several high-level UAW officers pleading guilty to charges, has so far focused on instances of bribery, embezzlement, kickback schemes and other financial wrongdoing.

In the case of Mr. Jones, prosecutors say the ex-union president, along with other senior UAW officials, illegally used union funds to make lavish purchases, such high-end liquor and expensive cigars, as well as pay for golf outings and stays at luxury condos and villas.

Matthew Schneider, the U.S. attorney in eastern Michigan overseeing the case, said Thursday the investigation could result in federal oversight of the labor union -- a tactic the government used in 1989 with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. That oversight process ultimately led the Teamsters to undergo several governance changes that could serve as a model for the UAW, he added.

""We are not done, and we cannot predict exactly when we will be done,"" Mr. Schneider said of the investigation.

Americans who believe in international institutions often lament that their countrymen don't appreciate the value of global cooperation. They'd have more credibility with more Americans if they called out anti-American outfits like the International Criminal Court.

Late last week the ICC revived a more than decade-old inquiry into alleged crimes committed by Americans and the Taliban in Afghanistan. It's a disgraceful example of moral and legal equivalence that equates Islamist insurgents who have killed thousands of Afghan civilians with the U.S., which ousted al Qaeda from Afghanistan, liberated millions of women, and has sacrificed much to rebuild the country.

The ICC came into force in 2002 with a mandate to investigate genocide and other crimes against humanity when a country is unwilling or unable to do so. But once created the institution took on a life and agenda of its own, focusing disproportionately on the U.S. and Israel. The court has produced few convictions, but dictators use it as a tool to prosecute opponents while remaining unscathed themselves. See Sudan's February announcement that it may turn over former dictator Omar al-Bashir.

The U.S. has never submitted to the court's jurisdictions. But Afghanistan joined in 2003, and now it's paying for that mistake. Coming days after Washington struck a deal to negotiate a peace agreement with the Taliban, the ICC's meddling is an especially unwelcome complication. The Taliban won't care what the ICC does, but an investigation could smear the elected Afghan government and the U.S.

""The ICC has today stumbled into a sorry affirmation of every denunciation made by its harshest critics over the past three decades,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement. He's not exaggerating. The U.S. has threatened to revoke visas for anyone investigating U.S. citizens, and we hope it makes good on that promise.

The Coronavirus Epidemic: Covid-19 Close to Pandemic

The new coronavirus is now close to becoming a pandemic, the World Health Organization said Monday, a day in which global financial markets plummeted and Italian officials extended a lockdown for the entire country.

""We're reaching that point,"" Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies program, said in a Monday news conference. ""We're very close.""

The WHO generally defines a pandemic as a disease that has become widespread around the world. The viral epidemic reached a new stage globally Monday, with confirmed cases outside China tripling over the past week.

Stock markets around the world plunged, as a price war for oil and the coronavirus fallout frightened investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 2,000 points. Oil prices lost a fifth of their value.

Italy on Monday night curtailed the movement of people living up and down the entire country, a dramatic step to reduce the virus's spread as cases swelled. The nationwide lockdown permits only essential travel to, from and within Italy, beginning Tuesday morning, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said.

""I'm aware of how serious this is, but I am forced to intervene even more decisively to protect all of us, and especially those who are more weak and vulnerable,"" Mr. Conte said.

When applied to the flu, the word pandemic usually signifies that a virus has reached the point that it can't be stopped, the WHO said. But WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the new coronavirus can be stopped, even if the agency does declare a pandemic.

""The threat of a pandemic has become very real,"" he said. But, he said, ""we shouldn't choose to live with it. We can win this battle.""

Of 110 countries that have reported the disease, 79 have had 100 or fewer cases, Dr. Tedros said. He added that 43 countries have fewer than 10 cases.

In an indication of how quickly the epidemic has shifted, Chinese health authorities said Monday they planned to close the last of 14 facilities that were repurposed temporarily as hospitals in Wuhan in early February when the central Chinese city was overwhelmed with coronavirus cases, according to CCTV. Some of the patients have been discharged, while others have been transferred to other hospitals.

Total confirmed coronavirus cases rose Monday to 113,605, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. There were about 30,000 cases outside mainland China, versus around 10,000 a week ago. The U.S. tally grew to 605 cases, with at least 25 deaths.

Case numbers rose in Washington, New York and California, the three hardest-hit U.S. states, among other U.S. locales. King County public health officials reported three more deaths, all of whom were residents at the Washington nursing home at the center of the state's outbreak. Officials said there were 33 new cases, including two of these most recent deaths, in the county Monday.

In Santa Clara County, Calif., a woman in her 60s who was hospitalized for several weeks died Monday morning, becoming the state's second death.

Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. recommended employees in their New York offices work from home for most or all of March as cases of the virus increase in the city.

The number of positive cases in these hard-hit states has ballooned in recent days as testing capabilities and criteria expands. Louisiana and Ohio reported their first cases; at least 11 states have declared states of emergency, including Ohio, Illinois and Rhode Island.

Roughly 80% of Covid-19 cases tend to be mild or moderate -- and more than 63,000 people globally have recovered -- but those who are older or have underlying health conditions, such as lung disease or diabetes, are at a higher risk.

Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said those in higher-risk groups should consider stocking up on medication or household items and avoid crowds or unnecessary travel.

Meanwhile, five congressional lawmakers said they were placing themselves on self-quarantine after having contact with people who tested positive for the virus.

The White House said Monday that President Trump has not been tested ""because he has neither had prolonged close contact with any known confirmed COVID-19 patients, nor does he have any symptoms."" The White House said he remains in ""excellent health, and his physician will continue to closely monitor him.""

Vice President Mike Pence said that he hadn't been tested for coronavirus.

Carnival Corp.'s Grand Princess cruise ship docked in Oakland, Calif., on Monday, after staying off shore for days due to the virus. One former passenger died, becoming California's first Covid-19 death, and 21 current passengers, including 19 crew members, on the boat tested positive for the virus.

All on board will be quarantined.

As the ship headed to shore, passenger Helen Cloninger Curtis, 63-year-old from Helena, Mont., said she felt emotional. ""Glad to get ashore,"" she said, ""but nervous as to what is in store for us now.""

Seventy-eight state and local public-health labs now have the capacity to run tests for Covid-19. Testing has been a bottleneck in the country's response so far, as kits were slow to roll out nationwide. Capacity to test and the criteria to test will likely vary by state, Dr. Messonnier said.

The world-wide death toll surpassed 4,000 -- the bulk of it in China, especially in the central city of Wuhan, which first reported the pneumonialike virus in December. Italy has the second-highest number of deaths at 463, and the total number of confirmed infections there climbed to 9,172, surpassing South Korea's 7,478 cases.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced sweeping restrictions on Monday requiring all arrivals on international flights to place themselves in quarantine for two weeks.

South Korean Vice Health Minister Kim Ganglip said the spread of the coronavirus appears to be slowing in the country but that new infections could come from people returning from abroad. The country added 165 cases, the lowest daily new numbers since Feb. 25, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Chinese health authorities reported 40 new cases on the mainland in the past day, bringing its total number of confirmed infections to 80,735, up about 1% from a week ago.

The Coronavirus Epidemic: Trump Weighs Payroll Tax Cut, Other Aid

WASHINGTON -- President Trump said his administration will discuss with Congress several measures to ease the economic pain inflicted by the coronavirus, including a possible payroll tax cut and help for hourly wage earners.

Administration officials were planning to meet with congressional Republicans about the proposals on Tuesday. Mr. Trump said he would hold a news conference on Tuesday afternoon to lay out the proposals in more detail. ""They will be major,"" he said.

""We're also going to be talking about hourly wage earners getting help so they can be in a position where they're not ever going to miss a paycheck,"" the president told reporters in the White House briefing room on Monday evening, adding that the administration was considering ""creating loans for small businesses.""

White House officials were split, however, over whether the president should embrace a payroll tax cut now, and if so, how big it should be, according to two people familiar with the discussion, who said there were strong views from both sides and a spirited debate at a closed-door meeting the president held with senior officials.

Trade adviser Peter Navarro -- backed by Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, and legislative affairs director Eric Ueland -- argued in favor of a payroll tax cut, the people said.

On the other side, National Economic Council Director Lawrence Kudlow and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called instead for narrowly targeted measures aimed at helping workers without sick leave and businesses facing virus-related disruptions, the people said. They questioned how expensive and how effective a payroll tax cut would be.

Mr. Navarro attended Monday's press conference, but was one of the only officials to depart with Mr. Trump, while the others stayed and took questions.

A White House spokesman declined to comment.

Earlier Monday, top Republican senators signaled they were hesitant to move forward quickly with either a broad-based stimulus package or narrower measures, cautioning that it was too early to assess the economic damage from the outbreak.

""Let's see where we are in a month from now or three weeks from now. It's just too early, I think people need to stay calm as much as they can,"" said Sen. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.), chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said.

The White House and Congress are under pressure to shore up the economy as markets reel on fears of a global recession.

Messrs. Kudlow and Mnuchin are scheduled to meet with Senate Republicans at their weekly policy lunch on Tuesday.

The most significant proposals mentioned at Monday's briefing, including a payroll tax cut, would require congressional approval. But Mr. Mnuchin, speaking at Monday's briefing, said ""there are certain authorities that the president has that we can do on our own.""

A payroll tax cut met with skepticism from House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D., N.Y.), who said it wouldn't help people who lose their jobs. Democrats are focused on helping ""the average working people around this country who are worried about how they're going to feed their families, because their businesses close,"" she said before a meeting with senior Democratic Party leadership.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) over the weekend outlined a series of measures including paid sick leave and expanded nutrition assistance, especially if school-lunch programs need to close. They didn't call for broader fiscal stimulus.

Senior administration officials met privately Monday afternoon to discuss coronavirus measures. In addition to the payroll tax cut, they discussed paying hourly employees who miss work because of the virus and deferring taxes for industries hardest hit by the outbreak, including the airline and cruise industries, administration officials said.

Business & Technology: Led Zeppelin Wins Copyright Appeal

Led Zeppelin didn't steal the opening bars of ""Stairway to Heaven,"" a federal appeals court ruled, in a decision that music executives hope will slow claims that some of the most popular songs are rip-offs.

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco on Monday put to rest a closely watched case that began in 2016 when a Los Angeles federal jury decided the British rock group didn't steal parts of the 1971 hit from an obscure single, ""Taurus,"" by the band Spirit. The Ninth Circuit overturned that ruling in 2018, saying the judge made errors in the original case.

The case was reheard en banc -- meaning 11 appellate judges heard the case versus the typical panel of three -- in September, with music lawyers anticipating the decision would set a precedent in an area of copyright law that has become increasingly contentious since a trial over the song ""Blurred Lines"" in 2015.

In that case, the scope of copyright infringement was extended beyond melody and lyrics to include elements contributing to the sound and feel of the music. In 2016, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's finding, and singer-songwriters Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were ordered to pay $5.3 million for copying the 1977 Marvin Gaye hit ""Got to Give It Up.""

Music lawyers point to that decision as the impetus for many recent copyright cases, including one last year in which Katy Perry and collaborators of her 2013 hit ""Dark Horse"" were ordered to pay $2.8 million in damages for infringing on an 11-year-old Christian rap song.

""Plaintiffs' lawyers have started to say, 'Let's roll the dice' if there's a song that makes a ton of money, and juries have been siding with the plaintiffs,"" said music-trial litigator Ed McPherson, who filed an amicus brief in support of Led Zeppelin. ""I think it will put a pin in the floodgates that really started opening with 'Blurred Lines.'""

On Monday, Mr. McPherson and others applauded the Ninth Circuit's overturning of the ""inverse-ratio rule.""

In copyright cases, juries must determine whether the defendant could have accessed the alleged infringed song and whether the songs are substantially similar. The inverse-ratio rule held that the more access a plaintiff could show, the less similarity was required to establish infringement. With the rise of music streaming on services like YouTube and Spotify, the concept of access is ""increasingly diluted in our digitally interconnected world,"" the court said in overturning the rule.

Additionally, the court said copyright protection is limited to the deposit copy, or what is registered with the U.S. Copyright Office. That means if only sheet music is contained in the deposit copy -- as is the case with most older songs, including ""Stairway to Heaven"" -- the jury cannot hear a sound recording to consider how the song was performed.

""The value of a copyright case if a song is from the '60s or '70s probably just went down,"" said Christopher Buccafusco, a professor at Cardozo Law School in New York who also filed an amicus brief.

World News: Ethiopia Faults Design, Training in Crash

Faulty aircraft design and inadequate pilot-training recommendations from the manufacturer ledto the fatal crash of a Boeing Co. 737 MAX jet after takeoff from Addis Ababa in Ethiopia a year ago, according to an accident report issued by Ethiopian investigators.

The interim report released Monday about the crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 provides some new technical analyses along with details about the cockpit drama before the plunge -- with pilots pulling back on the controls with more than 180 pounds of force to no avail. But the document indicates that neither pilot error nor potential airline slip-ups contributed significantly to the tragedy that killed all 157 on board.

The findings contrast with other government and industry reports that highlighted the interplay of causal factors, ranging from Boeing's misguided engineering assumptions to lax regulatory oversight to at least one significant incorrect pilot command.

Monday's report gives short shrift to such contributing causes and focuses largely on Boeing's failings in devising a powerful new automated flight-control feature, called MCAS. That feature, which ended up aggressively and repeatedly pushing down the nose of the Ethiopian airliner, is being fixed before the global MAX fleet returns to service.

The global MAX fleet has been grounded since the March crash, touching off the biggest corporate crisis in Boeing's history and sending ripple effects throughout the aviation industry.

The report mentions but doesn't elaborate on a central question of why Ethiopian pilots, after turning off MCAS as required by an emergency checklist, ultimately flipped a switch that reactivated the feature that overpowered their efforts to pull out of the plane's dive. Within seconds, the plane became uncontrollable and ended up with its nose pointing down 40 degrees from level flight.

The interim report, among other things, concludes that the heart of the pilot training ""provided by the manufacturer was found to be inadequate."" It also indicates that certain cockpit alerts, designed to help pilots diagnose sensor malfunctions that could trigger a hazardous MCAS misfire, didn't work as intended or as they were described in the flight-crew operation manual. The final conclusions are expected later this year.

A spokesman for Boeing said the company continues to provide technical assistance in support of the Ethiopian-led investigation and looks forward to ""reviewing the full details and formal recommendations that will be included in the final report.""

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which has been criticized by congressional investigators and others for delegating too much authority to Boeing in initially vetting safety of the 737 MAX, said it is reviewing the interim findings. An email from a spokesman added: ""We believe it's important to have the full final report to evaluate it against other independent reports, so that we might fully understand all of the factors -- both mechanical and human -- that played a role in thistragic loss of life.""

The report also reveals, for the first time publicly, some other fundamental MAX design shortcomings. Investigators laid out the results of ground-simulator tests they conducted that pinpointed the difficulty of pilots cranking a control wheel in an emergency to counteract automated MCAS commands.

The Coronavirus Epidemic: China Woes Pressure Companies' Profits

BEIJING -- Before the coronavirus epidemic, U.S. companies were heading for record-low profitability in China as business conditions deteriorated and China's economy slowed to its lowest rate in decades, according to a survey of U.S. companies with operations in China.

That position will be further challenged as these companies seek to absorb what could be a historic hit in China, the world's second-largest economy and the epicenter of the novel coronavirus now ravaging the global economy.

The annual snapshot of business conditions, captured by the Beijing-based American Chamber of Commerce in China in a survey conducted in October and November, underscores how fragile conditions were for American companies before the Covid-19 epidemic began to come into public view in mid-January.

It calls into question whether U.S. companies in China are prepared to weather a prolonged economic rout that has ravaged the Chinese economy, a critical overseas market for many U.S. companies, for a month and a half -- and looks set to continue well into the spring.

""Large corporations are in fact a linchpin for small- and medium-sized enterprises. If large corporates are struggling with revenue and cash flow, there's a trickle-down effect,"" the American Chamber in China's chairman, Greg Gilligan, said in an interview. ""They'll all feel the crunch.""

Fears about the virus's impact on global growth have shaved trillions of dollars off the value of global stocks, as the virus's quick spread outside China stokes fears that it could hurt consumption, hold up investment and snarl supply chains.

Before the outbreak, U.S. companies in China were already concerned about their business prospects in the country, largely because of U.S.-imposed tariffs that had weighed on demand and increased manufacturing costs.

The rising cost of labor in China also led some firms to move their supply chains out of China, while others said the softening economy in China had made it difficult to grow.

American companies surveyed by AmCham reported their lowest levels of profitability since the chamber first began asking the question 18 years ago: 61% of members described their 2019 financial performance as profitable or very profitable, an 8-percentage point drop from the year before.

Those problems are only set to worsen.

With tens of millions of Chinese still quarantined, many companies are responsible for their employees' salaries, regardless of whether they are able to work, a further drag as U.S. companies warn they could lose as much as half of their annual revenue from China if the epidemic extends into the summer.

Many companies that have been able to restart some operations face increased labor costs, with workers earning triple their usual pay and requiring special protective gear.

The annual survey was sent to 771 of the chamber's member companies, of which 372 completed the majority of the questions, the chamber said.

Respondents represented large, midsize and small enterprises from a broad range of industries, including many with global operations.

Before the outbreak, more than 40% of American companies in resources and industrials -- including agribusiness, automotive, equipment makers and oil and gas companies, among others -- said they didn't expect their markets to grow in 2020.

U.S. News --- CAPITAL JOURNAL: Crisis Jolts Views on National Security

As the severity of the coronavirus outbreak was becoming clear, Republican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri sent a letter to the Food and Drug Administration arguing that the crisis was revealing a dangerous dependence on China in one key area.

""The novel coronavirus in China highlights severe, longstanding, and unresolved vulnerabilities in our capacity to produce lifesaving pharmaceutical drugs and medical devices for our own citizens,"" Mr. Hawley wrote. ""This is unacceptable.""

As that alarm suggests, the coronavirus is becoming far more than a public-health problem. Eventually the crisis will pass, but a shock as big as this one will change political and economic assumptions in some fundamental ways.

It is altering the very definition of a national security threat, increasing the incentive for American companies to diversify supply chains away from China, illustrating the limits of central-bank powers and increasing respect for much-maligned government professionals.

In an immediate political sense, the coronavirus outbreak likely is helping the Democratic primary campaign of former Vice President Joe Biden, whose executive-branch experience and more mainstream approach make him appear to be a safer choice than Sen. Bernie Sanders in a time of turmoil.

But that may be the least of the coronavirus effects. For years, national security professionals have been telling one another that, in a post-Cold War world, with a globally connected economy, nontraditional threats such as cyberattacks, biological warfare and global pandemics should be getting more attention.

Indeed, the national security strategy President Trump's White House issued at the end of 2017 noted this changed threat matrix: ""Naturally emerging outbreaks of viruses such as Ebola and SARS, as well as the deliberate 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States, demonstrated the impact of biological threats on national security by taking lives, generating economic losses, and contributing to a loss of confidence in government institutions.""

Well, here we are. Unfortunately for the president, his administration followed those words of warning by downgrading the attention paid to pandemic threats on the National Security Council staff and proposing funding reductions for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those steps aren't likely to be repeated in the future.

""This should make U.S. leaders do what they should have done long ago, and do more to address national security threats of a nonmilitary nature,"" says Frederick Kempe, president of the Atlantic Council.

Certainly the crisis will make American firms think harder about a question they already had been pondering amid trade fights between the U.S. and China: Is it smart to be so dependent on a single source for either parts or finished products when so many external factors -- political currents in the U.S., heavy-handed tactics in China, now a global epidemic -- could undermine the reliability of that source?

There is an even broader implication for the financial system. The crisis will compel government leaders, in the U.S. and abroad, to re-evaluate the playbook they thought they had available to deal with an economic shock. For years, the go-to move for government officials was to rely on central bankers to cut interest rates to juice the economy in a time of fear and turmoil.

That, in fact, is what Mr. Trump pounded on the Fed to do in this crisis -- and is exactly what the Fed decided to do last week. Yet with interest rates already at historic lows, cutting another half a percentage point had virtually no impact on financial markets preoccupied with larger forces. Moreover, a rate reduction, by itself, does little to directly address this kind of crisis, in which easy money is powerless to restore broken supply chains.

""The markets were happy about that for about 15 minutes and then they gave it a Bronx cheer,"" says Alan Blinder, a former vice chairman of the Fed who now is a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""It illustrates that feeding the beast when the beast is hungry is almost impossible."" Policy makers will have to rethink their playbook -- and think about fiscal rather than monetary stimulus.

The coronavirus also is revealing how a fundamentally altered oil market affects the U.S. Oil prices are collapsing as China's need for fuel wanes. For decades, lower oil prices translated automatically into good news for the American economy. No longer. The fracking boom has made America a net energy exporter, and collapsing oil prices hurt upstart American energy companies.

One final effect of note: Government professionals have been taking a drubbing in the past few years, widely accused of being part of a ""deep state"" interested in undermining elected officials. Suddenly the expertise of government pros is newly appreciated. There is no more reassuring figure in the public eye at the moment than Anthony Fauci -- who has been director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for 35 years.

Cleaning Up the FISA Mess

Inspector General Michael Horowitz in December exposed gross FBI abuse of a secret surveillance court in obtaining warrants to spy on former Trump aide Carter Page. House leaders late Tuesday struck a bipartisan deal to impose greater accountability, though in at least one respect it may make things worse.

Congress is facing a March 15 deadline to reauthorize three critical surveillance tools, all of which are overseen by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. That's the court the FBI duped in 2016-17 by supplying false information provided by the Hillary Clinton campaign and omitting exculpatory facts about Mr. Page.

Despite these revelations, House Democrats initially planned a reauthorization that contained negligible reform. But a revolt by progressives against nearly any surveillance forced Democratic leaders to seek GOP votes. Thus the chance for some modest reform.

Congress created FISA in the late 1970s to guard against wiretap abuse. The best reform would be to abolish the court. As legal sages Laurence Silberman and Robert Bork pointed out in 1978, Presidents are responsible to voters if they abuse spying powers. FISA inserts unelected Article III judges into the process, diluting accountability. The FBI insisted its Page applications were valid since the court approved them, while the court blames a dishonest FBI. The abuses are always someone else's fault.

Alas, abolishing FISA now would require a rewrite of most intelligence laws -- which isn't feasible before this reauthorization. The fallback is to change the FISA process to impose more accountability on the FBI and Justice Department, and the GOP seems to have achieved some important victories.

The most significant reform writes into law Attorney General Bill Barr's recent administrative requirement that politically sensitive investigations be approved by the AG. One scandal of the Page investigation is that the FBI had no obligation to consult or even notify its Justice bosses. As a cabinet official, the AG is accountable to the President and thus to voters.

Another improvement requires a system of checks to ensure that information submitted to the court is accurate. The Horowitz report highlighted the ease with which individual agents could drop false details into the Page file, while leaving out exculpatory facts.

Republicans also won criminal penalties for officials who make false representations to the court. The risk here is that a criminal standard could end up punishing intelligence officials who make good-faith errors. Our sources say the bill's language is narrow enough that it won't trap honest mistakes but will punish FBI agents who try to pass off on the court disinformation of the kind peddled by partisan spy Christopher Steele.

The House version also includes greater access by the House and Senate intelligence committees to the documents used to justify FISA applications. Recall how the Justice Department initially refused to let then House Intelligence Chair Devin Nunes review the Page warrant files. Only thanks to Mr. Nunes's doggedness did we learn about the FBI's FISA abuse. The risk here is that some Members might abuse the privilege to leak.

The bill's worst reform would let a FISA judge choose an outsider advocate for the target of a FISA application. In theory, advocates would find and critique the abuses found in the Page application. In practice, they could dilute accountability further. There's no guarantee advocates would stop political shenanigans, though they may impede legitimate FISA warrants.

Consider the FISA court's recent appointment of David Kris as its point man for internal reform. Mr. Kris criticized the Bush Administration's wiretaps of suspected terrorists in 2006 but defended the FBI's abuse of Mr. Page. An advocate system would create another unaccountable bureaucratic layer to engage in finger pointing when things go wrong.

FISA was created as a check on wiretap abuses, but it failed as do most attempts to mess with the Constitution's separation of powers. We'd prefer to remove Article III judges from the executive branch where they don't belong, but this reform will at least make it harder to repeat the FBI's Page disgrace.

Many Ransomware Hackers Can't Undo Their Deeds

CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Paying hackers to recover data doesn't guarantee they will actually do so, and sometimes it's because they don't know how, experts say.

The availability of ransomware on dark-web forums means that anyone with the inclination and a relatively low level of technical ability can aim an attack at a company or a city, said Roy Hadley, special counsel at law firm Adams & Reese LLP who focuses on data security and privacy.

""Previously you had a few bad actors, but they knew what they were doing. Now you have kids who are infecting networks with ransomware who really don't know how to do it right in the infection stage, and they definitely don't know how to do it on the decryption stage,"" he said, speaking at the WSJ Pro Cybersecurity Symposium on Monday.

Even the professionals sometimes hand over bad decryption tools once they are paid, said Jeff Stutzman, chief information security officer at security company Global Guardian LLC, on the sidelines of the conference.

""Two years ago, I paid the third-largest ransom in U.S. history. The company was losing $25 million a day, they'd shut down trading on Nasdaq, and were facing extinction. When the first encryption key came, three hours after I paid a very high, six-figure sum, it didn't work,"" he said.

After communications with the attackers, a second key did work, Mr. Stutzman said, but that's often not the end of the story for companies hit by a ransomware attack.

""Within 30 days, you'll start to see new activity. We fought them back for months and months,"" he said. The attacks stopped only after Mr. Stutzman's team was able to identify the ransomware, a variant that changed its parameters on the fly to avoid detection software.

Authorities such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation advise companies not to pay ransoms, saying it encourages further attacks. Senior officials from the Department of Homeland Security have repeated that warning in recent weeks.

""It just feeds the beast,"" said Maria Thompson, state chief risk and security officer for North Carolina, referring to paying ransoms.

In any case, Mr. Hadley said, paying ransoms only fixes the immediate problem, if it solves it at all. It does nothing to fix the underlying vulnerabilities that let attackers penetrate the network in the first place, he said, and those who neglect closing security holes could find themselves being extorted again.

U.S. News: U.S. Cyber Defenses Fall Short, Commission Says

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. government needs to adopt structural changes not seen since the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks to confront proliferating cyber threats that increasingly endanger national and economic security, a government commission has concluded.

The Cyberspace Solarium Commission is releasing a report Wednesday detailing the results of a study, calling for changes ranging from modifications of existing functions to the substantial overhaul of the federal government.

One recommendation, for example, urges the creation of new committees in Congress dedicated solely to cybersecurity. Another calls for creation of a Senate-confirmed post of National Cyber Director in the White House.

In sometimes stark language, the commission assesses bluntly that the U.S.'s current approach to preventing or mitigating damage from cyberattacks is fundamentally flawed and in need of immediate change.

""The U.S. is currently not designed to act with the speed and agility necessary to defend the country in cyberspace,"" the report said. ""Our country has lost hundreds of billions of dollars to nation-state-sponsored intellectual property theft using cyber espionage.""

The report says the U.S. must better prepare for a major cyberattack that could, for example, ""create chaos and lasting damage exceeding that wreaked by fires in California, floods in the Midwest, and hurricanes in the Southeast.""

The commission is a congressionally mandated body formed last year and led by bipartisan members of Congress and current and former officials from various federal agencies.

Authors of the report acknowledged in interviews that several recommendations may be difficult to achieve, even in the long term, given political hurdles and Washington's tendency to stick to the status quo in the absence of crisis.

""This is the 9/11 Commission report without 9/11,"" said Sen. Angus King, a Maine independent who caucuses with Democrats and co-chaired the commission. ""We understand that this is a tall order.""

A core theme of the 182-page report is that successive presidential administrations largely have failed to deter Russia, China and other adversaries, including criminal groups, from carrying out increasingly debilitating cyberattacks.

Cyber-policy experts have discussed deterrence for years but have found that traditional tools -- such as sanctions or indictments -- yield little to no change in behavior.

The report outlined a three-tiered strategy of ""layered cyber deterrence"" to reduce the consequences of cyberattacks. Those layers include shaping acceptable international norms in cyberspace, denying benefits to adversaries seeking gain through cyber capabilities, and imposing greater costs -- including direct retaliation when necessary -- on those who do.

""The three layers of cyber deterrence rest on a common foundation: the need to reform how the U.S. government is organized to secure cyberspace and respond to attacks,"" the report said.

Several other commissions previously studied cybersecurity and recommended dramatic new approaches by the federal government. But those typically haven't involved current members of Congress or senior leadership from federal agencies.

Four U.S. lawmakers are serving on the 14-member Cyberspace Solarium Commission, as did senior national security officials, including FBI Director Chris Wray and Chris Inglis, the former deputy director of the National Security Agency.

Riskier Muni Bonds Miss Rally

Municipal-bond prices have surged as the potential impact of the novel coronavirus has driven investors into safer assets. But not all bonds have enjoyed the rally, with investors shying away from riskier debt and from securities likely to be affected by the virus, namely travel and hospitality bonds.

Investors are paying less for debt from convention-center hotels and airports as the potential economic reach of the novel coronavirus becomes clearer. Overall prices on riskier bonds fell last week as well, as investors pulled money from high-yield funds and the S&P Municipal Bond High Yield Index dropped five days in a row.

Some investors have become increasingly concerned that amid signs of a global slowdown, these less creditworthy bonds carry more risk than they are worth, analysts said.

""A whole bunch of municipal-bond credits are reliant on a well-functioning economy, are reliant on a well-functioning transportation industry,"" said Nicholos Venditti, a portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management. ""That's a little scary.""

Overall, municipal-bond prices have continued to climb in the roughly $4 trillion muni market as investors seek out safe-haven investments, driving yields to a nearly 40-year low Friday, according to Refinitiv.

Muni bonds have been a sought-after investment over the past several years as falling supply and the increasing value of the tax exemption on municipal-bond interest have stoked demand. That leaves plenty of room for prices to fall as the market reacts to risks associated with the virus.

Yields rose between 12% and 35% from Feb. 28 to March 5 on a sampling of a dozen bonds backed by airports, airlines, a convention-center hotel and an amusement park, according to an analysis by Jon Barasch, director of municipal evaluations at financial analytics company ICE Data Services. The comparison is based on trade data and the firm's valuations of those bonds.

That contrasts with the broader municipal market, where yields fell 10% for five-year bonds over the same period and rose by a maximum of 3% for longer-maturity debt, according to ICE Data Services' Muni Yield Curve.

Beginning March 2, ""the weakness became more prevalent,"" Mr. Barasch said.Yields rise as prices fall.

While municipal bonds are most often the liabilities of state and local governments with the power to collect taxes and fees, about $784.5 billion is issued on behalf of nonprofit or for-profit businesses, according to Federal Reserve data, typically for projects thought to have some public benefit, such as economic development.

Prices dropped on some bonds backed by airline payments last week, Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board data show. Bonds issued in October to build an aircraft-maintenance facility at Los Angeles International Airport traded at 115 cents on the dollar Thursday, down from nearly 119 cents on the dollar in mid-February. Bonds that financed a passenger terminal construction project at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport, which last traded around 107 cents on the dollar in late 2018 and which analysts had valued at about 106, sold for 103 cents on the dollar on Friday.

Meanwhile, the S&P Municipal Bond High Yield Index experienced its biggest one-day drop in more than a year Friday. It dropped every trading day last week. The VanEck Vectors High-Yield Municipal Index ETF has its biggest price drop in at least five years Monday, a decline of more than 5%, as investors continued to pull money from high-yield munis.

Mr. Venditti said that the municipal market tends to react more slowly than the corporate-bond market, where bond prices have already fallen for many companies whose fates are linked to travel or economic growth. ""Ultimately that lag may cost investors,"" he said.

For example, tax-exempt municipal bonds backed by United States Steel Corp. could fetch a yield of 2.394%, or an estimated 3.8% after taxes if sold today, according to an analysis of Bloomberg data by Mr. Venditti. That compares with an expected yield of 10.801% on the company's corporate debt.

It isn't just the infrastructure and transportation sectors that are vulnerable. High-yield muni-bond funds often contain the debt of senior-living facilities and financially distressed local governments, two borrowers looking particularly susceptible to the impact of the coronavirus. Long-term-care facilities around the country are bracing themselves after a facility in Kirkland, Wash., emerged as the site of some of the earliest U.S. cases.

Business News: PG&E, First Responders Settle --- At issue is more than $4 billion in bankruptcy claims not set aside for victims

PG&E Corp. has come to terms with federal and state first responders, who have agreed they won't take money set aside for victims of the wildfires that drove California's largest utility into bankruptcy.

Announced at a hearing Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco, the utility's agreements with the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency and state agencies clear up a major trouble spot for PG&E, which is racing to meet a June 30 deadline to emerge from bankruptcy.

PG&E filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2019 and is proposing a $59 billion bankruptcy exit plan, which earmarks $25.5 billion for insurance companies, cities and people with damages stemming from fires linked to PG&E equipment.

As Judge Dennis Montali weighed the company's bid for approval to start the voting process on the plan, lawyers announced the agreements with FEMA and California agencies.

Due to the agreements, people who lost loved ones, homes and businesses to the blazes of 2017 and 2018 will no longer have to worry that they will be forced to share with government emergency services the $13.5 billion earmarked for fire victims under PG&E's proposed chapter 11 plan.

California is dropping its claims to recoup about $300 million it spent on firefighting and emergency services, while FEMA has agreed to chop its claim from $3.9 billion to $1 billion. Additionally, FEMA has agreed it will only attempt to collect after all individual victims are paid in full from the $13.5 billion.

Justice Department lawyer Matthew Troy said the settlement still needs approval from various agencies and the Justice Department.

The pact represents a turnabout for an agency whose regional administrator, Robert Fenton, had in recent months threatened to pursue wildfire victims in court to recoup the money the federal government spent on everything from traffic control to emergency housing as the fires swept through PG&E's service territory.

FEMA said PG&E was to blame for lax safety practices that created the conditions for the catastrophic fires, and if the company didn't pay back federal emergency aid agencies, FEMA would attempt to collect from the victims.

The federal agency's stance triggered a backlash from lawyers for fire victims, who had been fighting PG&E in court for years.

The $13.5 billion payout to the victims will be in the form of cash and stock, and it will be placed in a trust, as individuals and businesses prove out their claims and collect their money, assuming the company's chapter 11 plan makes it to the finish line.

Once the votes are in, PG&E will return to court to seek approval of a chapter 11 plan that calls for the utility to issue a combination of new debt and equity. To exit bankruptcy, PG&E will need to come up with $59 billion to pay creditors, and contribute to a statewide fund designed to protect its balance sheet from future wildfire damage claims.

New York lawmakers, facing a $6 billion budget deficit, began the month with an optimistic projection. Stock markets were doing well, Wall Street bonuses were coming in strong, and lawmakers could plug some of the gap by assuming another $700 million in revenue was coming.

Also at the beginning of the month, the state confirmed its first case of novel coronavirus.

With U.S. markets in turmoil and the potential for an economic slowdown fueled by closures and cancellations rising, Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday asked the state comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, to reassess the revenue situation.

His determination will have a major impact on the spending plan that lawmakers are crafting before the state fiscal year ends March 31. Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, proposed a $178 billion budget that didn't increase taxes. Democrats who control the state Assembly and Senate are set to unveil counterproposals.

""It's pretty obvious there are significant risks now to the economy and certainly state revenue,"" Mr. DiNapoli said in an interview.

Mr. DiNapoli, a Democrat, said analysts in his office will examine the most recent data regarding tax collections, tourism and the performance of Wall Street firms. Mr. DiNapoli's office publishes an annual estimate of profits and bonuses in New York's securities industry and found that it accounted for 18% of state revenue in the fiscal year that ended in 2018.

The S&P 500 is down 14% over the past month. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index is down 29% over the same period.

Mr. Cuomo said during a Tuesday radio interview that the effects of the coronavirus likely would decrease revenue. New York has 173 confirmed cases.

""Forget just the stock market and the financial bonuses,"" Mr. Cuomo said. ""Reservations at hotels are being canceled. Businesses are canceling their meetings. Conventions are canceling, restaurants are empty, tourism is way down. You may be looking at a nine-month economic slowdown across the board.""

State officials jointly estimated on March 1 that they would collect about $57 billion of personal income taxes in the coming fiscal year, the largest revenue stream in the budget.

Fiscal watchdogs said the reconsideration was a prudent step, given the spread of the virus.

U.S. News: Court Grants Congress Access to Mueller Files

WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court ruled that Congress can have access to grand-jury materials from Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in a 2-1 ruling Tuesday, sided with the Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee, which sought access to material that was redacted from the 448-page special counsel report, as well as some of the exhibits and transcripts referenced in the report.

The report was the culmination of Mr. Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and whether President Trump or his associates were connected with that interference.

Mr. Mueller found insufficient evidence to charge anyone associated with the Trump campaign of a crime in connection with Russian election interference, and he said he couldn't exonerate Mr. Trump of obstructing the probe. Attorney General William Barr then concluded that Mr. Trump's actions didn't amount to obstruction of justice. Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.

Democrats on the Judiciary Committee previously said they needed the underlying Mueller materials to evaluate whether Mr. Trump committed an impeachable offense in the course of the investigation.

The appeals court, in an opinion by Judge Judith Rogers, said the committee had established it had a valid need for the information, especially because Mr. Mueller stopped short of making conclusions about Mr. Trump's conduct, in part to avoid pre-empting the House from doing so.

""The committee has established that it cannot fairly and diligently make a final determination about the conduct described in both volumes of the Mueller Report without the grand jury material referenced therein,"" wrote Judge Rogers, who was joined in the majority by Judge Thomas Griffith.

Judge Griffith wrote the appeals court's recent ruling against the Judiciary Committee that declined to enforce Democrats' subpoena for testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn. The judge on Tuesday said the fight over the grand-jury materials involved different issues that gave the House the upper hand.

In dissent, Judge Neomi Rao said it wasn't clear that the committee could still show that it needed the materials, given that the House already impeached the president and the Senate acquitted him. Judge Rao also maintained that the Judiciary Committee didn't have standing to obtain a court order requiring the Justice Department to turn over the grand-jury materials.

For Congress, the ruling is a narrow victory that affirms the legislature's ability to receive evidence collected as part of criminal investigations to use as part of potential impeachment proceedings.

It is unlikely to have a significant impact on the majority of congressional oversight disputes, which don't involve criminal information or impeachment proceedings.

""We are reviewing the decision,"" said a spokeswoman for the Justice Department.

On Capitol Hill, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) cheered the decision. ""This ruling is an unequivocal rejection of the President's insistence that he is above the law and his blanket refusal to cooperate with congressional requests for information,"" she said in a statement.

Tuesday's decision echoes a precedent from 1974 when the chief judge of the Washington, D.C., federal court transmitted a report of grand-jury material to the House as part of its inquiry into whether President Nixon should be impeached.

The court fight was sparked by a dispute between the Justice Department and Congress over the evidence collected by Mr. Mueller's investigation using a grand jury, a typically secret process designed to keep investigative details from being revealed publicly.

The department said it couldn't disclose the materials to Congress under the federal rules governing the secrecy of grand-jury material, while Congress said that the law provided for exemptions for a judicial proceeding. It argued that its impeachment investigation qualified as such a proceeding, and that it needed the materials as part of the investigation.

The Justice Department earlier turned over a version of the Mueller report to Congress that revealed some of the sensitive information it had redacted from the public version of the report, but it has refused to provide any material obtained by a grand jury, citing the longstanding precedent that grand-jury investigations are by law secret.

U.S. News: Flood Prevention Drives A Wedge in Miami Beach

MIAMI BEACH, Fla. -- Tensions are coming to a head as this city prepares for new infrastructure projects designed to fortify the low-lying island against increased flooding and sea-level rise.

Climate experts praise Miami Beach -- a diverse, international city in South Florida with wealthy sections -- for devoting $1 billion to tackle the problem, and other coastal communities look to it as a model. But some residents say plans to raise roads as much as about 5 feet above sea level and add storm-water pumps with generators the size of vans are an unsightly intrusion and a potential drag on property values.

The conflict presents the mayor and city commissioners with a dilemma: How far can they go in accommodating homeowners' concerns without undercutting the city's long-term viability?

""We will have to have the political will to make unpopular decisions,"" said City Commissioner Ricky Arriola. ""Despite the overwhelming scientific evidence and engineering solutions proposed, there is going to be a group of our citizens who want us to do nothing.""

Cities around the U.S., including New York, Norfolk, Va., and Charleston, S.C., confront similar challenges. Because Miami Beach is farther along than many of them in feeling the effects of climate change and trying to respond, its experience could hold lessons.

Lying an average of about 4 feet above sea level on porous limestone, Miami Beach is especially vulnerable. Sea levels are projected to increase as much as 21 inches by 2040 and 54 inches by 2070, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Jacobs Engineering Group Inc., an engineering firm hired by Miami Beach to review its climate-adaptation strategy, is expected to release its final recommendations in the next few weeks after a yearlong study. When the firm offered a preview of its proposals for road-raising and other projects at a recent public meeting, homeowners balked.

""Until we've figured out how to keep private properties dry, we should not be spending a fortune on raising streets in the entire city,"" said resident Hal Phillips.

In 2014, the city embarked on a plan to address more frequent and intense downpours by installing bigger storm-water pipes and new pump stations to push rainwater out to sea. It also began elevating sea walls and raising roads in the lowest-lying areas to address sea-level rise. The roughly $1 billion program is funded by a combination of sources, including bonds and residential and business utility fees.

The Sunset Harbour neighborhood, which overlooks Biscayne Bay and often flooded during the highest tides, was the first commercial and condo area where these measures were implemented.

Since January 2017, after the project was completed, the area has avoided 85 flooding incidents that would have occurred without the changes, said Roy Coley, the city's public works director.

A January study commissioned by the city and led by consulting firm ICF International Inc. estimated that raising roads in the neighborhood increased condo values 11.9%.

After Mayor Dan Gelber was elected in 2017, he invited several organizations to examine the city's approach to resiliency, including the nonprofit Urban Land Institute, which largely praised it. Last year, the city hired Jacobs Engineering Group.

Not all of the firm's suggestions are controversial. Some of them involve ""blue-green infrastructure,"" which mimics natural defenses against flooding risks. They include ""bioswales,"" or vegetated channels along streets, and a new park with ponds -- proposals aimed at collecting and cleaning storm water.

The recommendations that have proved most divisive are those involving elevated roads in single-family neighborhoods.

Some residents argue that by raising the street above the level where houses sit, storm water will flow down and inundate properties -- a claim the city disputes. That, in turn, will depress real-estate values, they say.

""We're under siege,"" said Bob Kunst, who lives in the affluent Lakeview area in the middle of Miami Beach. ""The city's approach to this has jeopardized everybody.""

Nearly two years ago, when the city first proposed elevating streets in the Lakeview area, Mr. Kunst and other residents formed an organization to fight the effort. They battled a rival neighborhood group that supported the road-raising plan. The city ended up postponing the project.

President Expected To Extend Tax Date

WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is likely to extend the April 15 tax deadline as part of an effort to mitigate the effects of the novel coronavirus on U.S. households and businesses, according to an administration official and another person familiar with the matter.

Neither the decision to extend the deadline nor the mechanics of how such an extension might work are yet final.

Normally, individuals must pay their prior year's taxes by April 15 or face penalties and interest charges. People can already get extensions through mid-October to file their returns as long as they have paid on time by mid-April. This decision would go further than that.

Extending the tax filing deadline would effectively act as a bridge loan for individuals and businesses facing disruptions from the virus. Treasury officials are still considering how far the filing deadline may be pushed back and who would be eligible for the extension, according to the person familiar with the discussions.

Officials believe they have the legal authority to waive penalties on late tax payments if they move back the filing date and are exploring whether they have the ability to waive the interest under an emergency disaster declaration.

Extending the deadline would also have temporary implications for the federal budget and borrowing. The Treasury depends on estimates of federal revenues to ensure it has enough cash to keep paying the government's bills on time.

Delaying tax payments could force the Treasury to borrow more in the near term. April is the largest month for federal tax payments. Last year, the Treasury collected $333 billion in individual income taxes that month.

Earlier Tuesday, House Democrats asked the Internal Revenue Service whether the government should consider pushing back the April 15 deadline, mentioning the government's existing authority to extend deadlines and waive penalties. The IRS often extends filing deadlines in affected areas after natural disasters, and the tax code specifically authorizes the Treasury to grant delays following presidentially declared disasters.

Besides the main April 15 deadline for individuals, there are also other tax deadlines for estimated payments and other types of taxpayers.

The IRS and White House didn't respond to requests for comment.

City Weighs Steps To Halt Virus in Jails

New York City correctional officials said Tuesday they were preparing measures to stop the coronavirus from infecting staff and prisoners at jails that experts said could become incubators for the rapidly-spreading disease.

The Department of Correction is focused on keeping its jail cells and shared space clean, screening visitors for symptoms, raising awareness with posters about avoiding the disease and encouraging inmates to keep a physical distance from each other, officials said.

There haven't been any confirmed cases in the city's jails, said Jacqueline Sherman, interim chairwoman of the Board of Correction at a meeting on virus preparedness Tuesday with jail and health officials. But that could change quickly, she said. ""If [the virus] further reaches into New York City, the city can expect to see it reach the jails,"" she said.

Lawyers and prisoner advocates voiced concerns about the impact of an outbreak reaching the city's jail facilities. More than 5,000 inmates are housed daily in New York City jails, including the main facility on Rikers Island. The jail population is constantly coming and going, with employees commuting to work there, attorneys visiting their clients and inmates being transported for court appearances.

City officials said an outbreak may lead to a staffing-resource problem and an increase in employees calling out sick. Another concern: Many people who are infected aren't symptomatic and could spread the disease before they realize they have it.

Patricia Feeney, deputy commissioner of quality assurance and integrity at the Department of Correction, and other officials said the city had instituted screening throughout the court system. There is now regular monitoring for inmates and staff for fevers and flulike symptoms. If a prisoner exhibits any, he or she will be given a mask and isolated, then flagged for immediate medical treatment.

Advocates said prisoners would have trouble following government CDC guidelines for avoiding getting or spreading coronavirus. Prisoner advocates said basic behavior like hand-washing or self-quarantining can be difficult in jail. Items like hand sanitizer are deemed contraband due to its high alcohol content.

In all scenarios, inmates are held in small, confined spaces, making jails conducive for the spread of diseases, said Homer Venters, former chief medical officer at New York City's Rikers Island jail complex.

""It's virtually impossible to clean or wipe down all the parts of the jail on a routine basis,"" he said. The most important measure would be limiting the number of people entering correctional facilities.

Half the U.S. prison population has an underlying illness, and have health-care needs that make them especially susceptible to the virus, said Josiah D. Rich, professor of medicine and epidemiology at Brown University. ""It's just a matter of time,"" he said of the virus reaching correctional facilities.

WASHINGTON -- President Trump's push to suspend the payroll tax to boost the economy during the coronavirus outbreak fell flat on Capitol Hill, as lawmakers of both parties said they preferred targeted measures to assist hourly workers and the battered travel industry.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is leading the administration's economic response to the outbreak, met Tuesday with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) to try to start negotiations on a package. Both chambers of Congress are set to leave Washington soon for a scheduled weeklong break, giving lawmakers little time to quickly pass stimulus legislation.

""I wouldn't say it's a negotiation. We're having discussions about various different policies,"" Mr. Mnuchin said after meeting with Mrs. Pelosi for about 30 minutes. ""There's a lot of interest on a bipartisan basis to get something done quickly.""

Mrs. Pelosi said she and Mr. Mnuchin sought to find ""where our common ground was, as to how we go forward.""

She declined to say whether the two had made any progress on a deal.

The House is aiming to vote on something before it leaves Washington on Thursday, likely a measure aimed at helping workers, a congressional aide said.

Monday's steepest one-day decline in the stock market since the financial crisis and a sharp slowdown in the travel industry have spurred efforts in Washington to put together an economic response. Congress passed and Mr. Trump signed an $8.3 billion spending bill last week funding efforts to develop a vaccine for the disease and assist response efforts across the country.

President Trump, Mr. Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow, the director of the White House National Economic Council, joined Senate Republicans for their weekly policy lunch Tuesday afternoon to gauge whether there is enough support for a payroll-tax cut and other proposals put forward by the president to shore up the economy.

Following the meeting, Mr. Trump told reporters he had discussed stimulus measures with Republicans, but offered few details.

U.S. News: Weinstein to Be Sentenced Today

When Harvey Weinstein is sentenced Wednesday in a Manhattan courtroom, some of his accusers plan to be there. They hope to watch him escorted in shackles to the defense table to learn that he will spend years in prison.

""People talk about closure -- and I'm ready to see that,"" said Tarale Wulff, a model who testified at trial that the Hollywood producer raped her.

Mr. Weinstein, 67 years old, faces between five and 29 years in prison after a jury found him guilty Feb. 24 of a first-degree criminal sexual act against Miriam Haley, a former production assistant, and the third-degree rape of onetime aspiring actress Jessica Mann. He was acquitted of the charges carrying the most severe penalty of life in prison -- two counts of predatory sexual assault -- but that the once-powerful Mr. Weinstein even stood trial marked a departure from cultural norms.

Mr. Weinstein says he has never had a nonconsensual sexual encounter.

During the seven-week trial, his attorneys tried to cast doubt on the multiple accusers' motivations for coming forward, describing the women as young actresses seeking the fame and fortune that Mr. Weinstein could easily facilitate.

For the dozens of women who leveled sexual-misconduct allegations against Mr. Weinstein, his sentencing represents validation after two years of uncertainty. Mr. Weinstein's case ignited the GBP MeToo movement in 2017, and Wednesday's court proceeding underscores that ""we made a loud noise,"" said Ms. Wulff.

""Just seeing someone like Harvey Weinstein, who was so powerful, spending a year, even a day in prison, is still shocking,"" said Dawn Dunning, a creative director and designer who testified that Mr. Weinstein put his hand up her skirt and tried to trade film roles for a threesome with his female assistant.

Ms. Dunning said she wants to see Mr. Weinstein get the maximum sentence allowed, 29 years. Ms. Wulff said she would like to see a sentence on the higher end of the range.

Ms. Dunning and Ms. Wulff were among six women who testified at Mr. Weinstein's trial, accusing him of sexual assault. Ms. Dunning and Ms. Wulff won't be a formal part of Mr. Weinstein's sentencing because prosecutors didn't charge him with wrongdoing in either accuser's case. Their testimony was intended to show a pattern of behavior by Mr. Weinstein.

In sentencing him, New York Supreme Court Justice James Burke will consider the evidence from trial as well as letters and sentencing recommendations submitted by the prosecution and defense teams, and a report on Mr. Weinstein's life compiled by the state's probation department. Two accusers -- Ms. Haley and Ms. Mann -- whose allegations led to criminal charges are allowed to give statements about the impact of the crimes.

In their letter to the court, prosecutors recommended the judge impose an onerous prison term but have yet to ask for a specific number. They called him a man who ""consistently advanced his own sordid desires"" and ""displayed a staggering lack of empathy"" for his entire adult, professional life.

Mr. Weinstein's defense team -- citing his years of charitable endeavors, unmatched fall from grace, acquittal on the most serious counts, and his age and health -- asked for the minimum: five years.

Even a relatively brief prison term may serve as a functional life sentence for Mr. Weinstein, whose health has visibly deteriorated since the allegations emerged. The producer was taken to Bellevue Hospital Center after the verdict, where he underwent heart surgery. He remained there for 10 days before his transfer to the city's Rikers Island jail facility last week.

For Ms. Dunning, Mr. Weinstein's conviction and impending prison term offset the harrowing experience of testifying in court and enduring an aggressive cross examination.

Donna Rotunno, the producer's lead lawyer, confronted Ms. Wulff with substantive gaps in her memory, which she recovered after more than 50 sessions with a sexual-trauma clinician.Defense attorney Arthur Aidala quizzed Ms. Dunning about why she didn't tell prosecutors that Mr. Weinstein assaulted her until weeks before the trial.

""Nobody wants to be the poster person for sexual assault,"" Ms. Dunning said.

Those who came forward feared Mr. Weinstein, who hired private investigators and lawyers to deter women from telling their stories. Many of the women said that after Mr. Weinstein was convicted and ordered into jail, they finally didn't have to fear him anymore.

The Coronavirus Epidemic: Double Whammy Hits Businesses

Businesses are bracing for a longer and steeper coronavirus-triggered downturn than the single-quarter event initially anticipated.

The regions hit by the coronavirus are experiencing a double whammy. Business operations across Asia, Europe and the U.S. are being disrupted by factory closures, quarantined workers and shortages of components, crimping the availability of goods and services -- a so-called supply shock. Meanwhile, postponed public events and mounting fear are causing consumers and businesses to hold back, avoiding travel, restaurants and lavish purchases, even where restrictions haven't been imposed -- a demand shock.

The combined effects risk pushing the global economy into a self-reinforcing, downward spiral, a possibility fueling market turmoil and prompting many executives around the world to prepare for darker scenarios than before.

Ohio-based retailer Abercrombie & Fitch Co. is preparing for the coronavirus to affect business for six months, according to its chief financial officer, Scott D. Lipesky. ""We operate in 20 countries around the world, and each of them is seeing some level of impact,"" he recently told investors.

Likewise, Kevin M. Fogarty, president of Houston polymer maker Kraton Corp., told investors he sees growing concern from the spread of the virus, ""with potential for the disruption and the duration to linger well into the second quarter or beyond.""

Moody's on Monday cut its expectations of 2020 growth in the U.S. to 1.5% from 1.7%, in China to 4.8% from 5.2%, and in the Group of 20 economies to 2.1% from 2.4%. Moody's Vice President Madhavi Bokil said, ""a sustained pullback in consumption, coupled with extended closures of businesses, would hurt earnings, drive layoffs and weigh on sentiment.""

Economists aren't forecasting a drawn-out global recession. They expect growth to rebound later this year after the epidemic is brought under control, but that could change if the virus continues to spread.

The outlook hinges hugely on China, where the epidemic began. The world's second-largest economy looks likely to avoid a recession yet spread enough pain to cause widespread damage. Some business leaders are warning it could be late 2020 before operations normalize.

Many businesses and economists initially expected the epidemic would track the same temporary dip and rebound seen in 2003 during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Now -- with all of Italy under quarantine and the numbers of infection cases rising in the U.S. and other major economies -- that is looking optimistic.

Suspension of travel is hitting airlines worse than the 2001 terrorist attacks, with ripple effects not only for hotels, restaurants and theaters but also the oil sector. American Airlines Group Inc. and Delta Air Lines Inc. both said Tuesday they planned to cut flights and ground planes after a drop in booking.

Europe relies heavily on exports of goods and services, which are worth almost 50% of its GDP, compared with just 12% for the U.S. A deep European recession could be triggered by prolonged weakness in its two main trading partners, China and the U.S., according to Sylvain Broyer, chief European economist at S&P Global Ratings.

Continental AG, a large German auto supplier, said Thursday it would step up cost-cutting measures because of the coronavirus, which could mean more layoffs and plant closures. The company operates around 50 factories and research facilities in China, and its supply chains have been hit hard by the disruptions.

The U.S. economy has been a bright spot in the global picture. Growth was on a solid footing, albeit slowing, before the coronavirus hit.

If the U.S. economy is thrown off course this year, ""it's not necessarily because of vulnerabilities that were there and waiting to be exploited, it's an all new situation,"" said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities. ""It's going to be consumer-driven, people staying at home, not traveling and not spending.""

China's Hard Line Slows Outbreak --- Authorities ignored global norms for responding to epidemics; other countries weigh tactics

When China's Communist Party locked down an entire city to fight the outbreak of a new coronavirus there, some global public-health officials warned that the iron-fisted approach ignored world-wide norms for responding to epidemics and could make things worse.

Now, with the number of new cases across China dwindling -- and rising outside its borders -- the nation's hard-line response to the pathogen is challenging decades of conventional wisdom about how best to handle infectious diseases.

This week Italy sealed itself off from the rest of the world, placing the entire nation under quarantine. South Korea has restricted travel inside the country and increased surveillance on its citizens.

On Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Wuhan, the city at the center of the pandemic, for the first time since the outbreak began, a signal that the Communist Party sees itself as winning its battle against the pathogen.

Chinese leaders were seemingly caught off-guard when the virus began to spread widely early this year. Authorities at first muzzled frontline doctors attempting to warn their peers and the public of the deadly new virus. Officials denied it could be transmitted between humans. The delays allowed infections to multiply.

Since then, Beijing has attacked it aggressively. The campaign, described by Mr. Xi as a ""people's war,"" melds technology with tactics from the party's Maoist past.

Authorities sealed off Wuhan, a city of 11 million, on Jan. 23. At least a dozen more lockdowns followed. The party dispatched armies of low-level enforcers to guard the gates of residential compounds and restrict the movements of people living inside.

The government tapped data from state-run mobile carriers to track down individuals who slipped lockdowns, recruited volunteers to go door-to-door in apartment buildings to record body temperatures, and enlisted the help of tech companies to develop apps to separate healthy people from those at high-risk.

China's government had, at various points in January and February, confined more than 500 million mostly healthy people -- more than the combined populations of the U.S. and Mexico -- to their homes, according to a conservative Wall Street Journal estimate based on state media reports. At its height, the quarantine encompassed at least 20 provinces and regions.

World Health Organization guidelines for epidemics recommend isolation only for individuals who show symptoms, and two-week quarantines for people exposed to a Covid-19 patient. Public-health experts in the West say that is because broad, indiscriminate quarantines are hard to enforce, encourage people to lie about their health and can disrupt access to critical supplies.

Some scientists say it is too early to know for certain whether the Communist Party's reaction to the threat is the right approach. Nevertheless, signs that the contagion is dwindling outside the epicenter have caused epidemiologists and other public-health experts to rethink their assumptions about what is possible in battling epidemics.

Arthur Reingold, an infectious-disease expert at the University of California, Berkeley's School of Public Health who was initially skeptical of China's approach, said, ""China has proven that maybe if you are draconian enough, if you put enough resources into it, you can actually retard transmissions.""

Other nations would likely face big obstacles employing the same tactics. Unlike in many other countries, China's government has a tolerance for economic pain and willingness to run roughshod over individual rights.

""Nothing like this has been tried before in modern history,"" said Tom Inglesby, director of the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""Most countries couldn't even logistically attempt it.""

The rapid imposition of quarantines, digital surveillance of potential virus carriers and mass testing have made it possible for China's government to trap most of the outbreak in Wuhan and its surrounding province of Hubei.

On March 9, 17 new cases of Covid-19 were diagnosed in Hubei, with two new cases in the rest of the country. Hubei has accounted for 96% of the 3,136 deaths from the virus in the country so far. The fatality rate for the disease stood at between 2% and 4% in Wuhan, where medical resources were stretched, and 0.7% elsewhere in China, the WHO said in a media briefing in late February.

With Covid-19 cases multiplying in other countries, the WHO said in a report published last week that China's strategy ""provides vital lessons for the global response.""

Giovanni Rezza, the chief epidemiologist at Italy's National Health Institute, was doubtful at first that China's measures could be implemented in Europe. He changed his mind over the weekend as the number of Italian cases climbed.

""There's no question they were able to combat the epidemic efficiently,"" he said Tuesday of China. ""We weren't able to contain our initial cluster. Our restrictions were softer than China's. But seeing how serious is the situation in the north, we couldn't help but be scared for the rest of Italy.""

South Korea, where the virus has infected more than 7,500 residents, has canceled public activities and raised its virus alert to red, the highest of four levels, clearing the way for authorities to cancel public activities and restrict domestic travel. The government also is conducting more aggressive surveillance on potential carriers of the virus.

The experience of Vivy Shen, a 27-year-old operations assistant at a video-streaming company in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, shows how Chinese authorities moved to contain the virus.

Ms. Shen spent two weeks in Wuhan on a work trip in the early stages of the outbreak, when officials were playing down the danger. She returned to Hangzhou the same day officials in Beijing dispatched medical researchers to Wuhan.

A few days later, the team revealed that the virus was passing from person to person. Officials announced the lockdown of Wuhan on Jan. 23, a day after Ms. Shen had traveled back to her hometown, the nearby coastal city of Wenzhou, to spend the Lunar New Year holiday with her family.

For a week, Ms. Shen was inundated with phone calls from police, community officials, health workers and others asking about her recent travel history and whether she had a fever. One call came from officials in a city she had passed through on her way to Wenzhou.

""They told me I had likely passed the place and my telecom provider had given them my data,"" she said.

Along with state-run rail operators and airlines, China's big three telecom providers -- China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom -- were the government's first line of defense against the spread of the virus. Chinese rules requiring a government-issued ID to purchase rail and plane tickets, and to buy SIM cards for phones, made it relatively easyfor authorities to track and contact anyone who had traveled through regions hard hit by the outbreak.

The mobile carriers shared location data on users who had passed through Hubei with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, which in turn passed it on to the National Health Commission and other agencies involved in the virus response.

The data enabled virus response teams to reconstruct the movements of potential virus carriers and others who may have come into contact with them, a process known as contact tracing, with unusual precision. Some cities used this information to publish messages on social media detailing the movements of likely carriers to warn populations that might have been exposed.

Soon, though, it became clear that the contagion was outpacing the data. As the number of new infections climbed, party leaders turned to older methods of control. They ordered local officials to seal off more cities and towns, and activated residential committees -- remnants of the Mao Zedong era -- to conduct human surveillance on residents of neighborhoods and apartment complexes.

Home to a large community of itinerant merchants and traders, Wenzhou was one of the worst hit in the early stages of the outbreak. Officials ordered buses to stop running and closed hotels and restaurants.

The residential committee overseeing her parents' apartment ordered Ms. Shen to self-quarantine indoors for 14 days. Her mother was allowed to leave the complex to buy groceries every other day, applying for an exit permit each time.

Authorities mandated the imposition of ""closed-style management"" at apartment complexes, blocking off side entrances so that residents can come and go only at a single point manned by security guards. The system mirrors those used to control Muslim minorities in the far western region of Xinjiang, where authorities have instituted a mix of digital and human surveillance to suffocate a separatist movement they say is driven by extremism.

Some local governments in Hubei, at the epicenter of the epidemic, have required residents who don't comply with health guidelines to undergo compulsory education.

In the Hubei city of Huanggang, people caught in public without a mask or wandering outside without authorization have to pay a 1,000 yuan ($140) fine, and a fee of 40 yuan a day for two weeks of ""forced study"" classes, which are conducted in a sports stadium with students seated far apart, Huanggang residents said in interviews.

As infections rose in Huanggang in early February, the Communist Party dispatched a team there with instructions to ""round up everyone who needs rounding up,"" according to a state broadcaster, a phrase the party also has used to describe its campaign against Muslims in Xinjiang.

In Wuhan, some younger residents have called the police on older relatives for refusing to take proper precautions against infection, according to 26-year-old Uyen Yang, one of the volunteers helping Hubei officials collate health data.

""They didn't know what else to do and are extremely worried,"" Ms. Yang said of friends who reported family members. ""Their parents won't listen to them.""

As the number of new infections declines, Chinese leaders are relaxing some of the stricter controls in a bid to restart the country's stalled economy. To guard against a resurgence in Covid-19 cases as people return to work, they have turned again to digital surveillance.

On orders from regulators, China Mobile and other telecom giants have developed services that call up a user's travel history over the prior 14 days -- the average incubation period of the virus -- so that employers and managers of commercial properties can ascertain the exposure of returning workers.

The government also has worked with e-commerce behemoth Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and social-media giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., the country's two largest tech companies, to develop smartphone apps that assign health ratings to individuals. The system Alibaba helped develop is color coded: Symptomless users with clean travel histories are given green badges that allow them to pass through city checkpoints with the scan of a QR code, while higher risk users are assigned yellow or red badges that limit their movements. On Tuesday, Hubei announced plans to implement a similar system as it begins to lift travel restrictions.

Some of those trapped in Wuhan have gone on social media to decry dire conditions in hospitals and a climate of uncertainty. Around the country, people prevented from returning to work live in fear of losing their jobs.

Still, the Chinese people interviewed by the Journal said they accepted the controls as a necessary sacrifice at a time of crisis.

Despite feeling uncomfortable at having her data shared with officials, Ms. Shen said she couldn't complain. ""Moments like this, it's not the time to be difficult about such things,"" she said.

Some Asian governments have expanded surveillance efforts. South Korea is using credit-card transactions to track patients' travel routes, and it started using a GPS-based app to monitor people under self-quarantine. Singapore's health authorities have tapped ride-sharing data andsurveillance cameras to do the same. In Taiwan, health inspectors track mobile-phone signals to make sure people don't ignore home-isolation orders.

Officials in China and elsewhere have promised that new surveillance measures put in place to fight Covid-19 are temporary. Academics and privacy advocates, however, warn that once mass data collection has begun, governments have few incentives to roll it back.

World News: Afghans Agree to Prisoner Release

The Afghan government agreed to release 1,500 Taliban prisoners as a goodwill gesture before starting talks with the insurgent group, putting the commitment in the form of a decree, a spokesman said.

The U.S. signed a deal with the Taliban last month to withdraw all troops within 14 months on the condition the group commit to breaking ties with terrorists and starting talks with the Afghan government and other parties.

The deal also stipulates the Afghan government, which isn't a signatory, must release up to 5,000 prisoners as part of a swap for talks to begin. The government has balked at releasing that many prisoners as a precondition for talks.

The decree, signed by President Ashraf Ghani, allows for the release of 100 prisoners a day for 15 days. After that, any further releases will be contingent on launching intra-Afghan peace talks.

The Taliban didn't immediately comment.

Biden Was Right to Back the Iraq War

'My friends are dead because of your policies,"" a man shouted at Joe Biden the other day. ""You are disqualified, sir."" He was referring to Mr. Biden's October 2002 vote for the Iraq war. But Mr. Biden should be proud of that vote.

Recall the history. President Bush, in his January 2002 State of the Union address, stated that Saddam Hussein had ""plotted to develop anthrax and nerve gas and nuclear weapons for over a decade"" and had ""something to hide from the civilized world."" He later warned that if Iraq didn't submit to inspections, the U.S. and allies might have to have to go to war with Iraq.

In October Congress passed a joint resolution empowering Mr. Bush to deploy armed forces ""as he determines to be necessary"" to defend America's security ""against the continuing threat posed by Iraq."" Mr. Biden was one of 29 Democrats to vote in favor. In February 2003, Secretary of State Colin Powell told the United Nations Security Council that Saddam was secretly developing weapons of mass destruction. But it turned out Saddam resisted inspections because he lacked WMD, not because he had them.

Assuming that he would soon be attacked, Saddam revealed to his generals that he had no WMD. If Saddam's own generals had believed he had WMD, one can hardly fault U.S. intelligence for coming to the same conclusion. The U.S. invaded Iraq in March 2003, and before the end of the month had defeated Iraqi troops and taken control of the country. U.S. troops had to go over Iraq with a fine-toothed comb before officials could conclude with certainty that there were no WMD.

In December 2003, U.S. servicemen found Saddam in an underground hideout. Before he was executed, he told interrogators that he wanted Iran to believe he had WMD. Iran was an archenemy he had fought in a bloody stalemate from 1980 to 1988. Saddam also said he wanted to reconstitute his nuclear program to compete with Iran and Israel in nuclear weapons.

Saddam Hussein was a cruel tyrant who used chemical WMD against Iraqi Shiites and Kurds and against Iran in 1981. In 1990 he conquered Kuwait, forcing the U.S. to go to war to reverse the invasion. Saddam was a menace to the region and the world, and Mr. Biden was right to support the war that deposed him.

U.S. News: Asylum Policy Can Be Enforced

WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to continue enforcing an immigration policy requiring asylum seekers at the southern U.S. border to wait in Mexico while their cases are considered.

The court on Wednesday granted an emergency request by the administration to leave the program in place for now while legal proceedings continue. The order blocks the effect of a lower-court decision that said the administration must stop implementing the policy.

The action is the latest in a series of emergency orders in which the Supreme Court has rescued or revived Trump administration policies on immigration, allowing the White House to maintain its plans while courts sort out their legality. The high-court orders have come in response to decisions by lower courts that concluded the administration's policies are unlawful, or likely so.

As is its custom with emergency orders, the court didn't explain its reasoning. While some recent matters have revealed deep divides on the Supreme Court, only Justice Sonia Sotomayor registered a public dissent to Wednesday's order.

The case hasn't been fully briefed or argued and the court's action isn't a ruling on the merits of the Trump policy.

The Trump administration has repeatedly credited its ""Remain in Mexico"" policy with being perhaps the single most effective deterrent for Central American and other migrants crossing the border to ask for asylum. The government ramped up the program last May, the same month border crossings reached a 12-year high, and the number of migrants arriving each month has since fallen about 75%.

The policy, formally called the Migrant Protection Protocols, made its debut in January 2019 as the Trump administration sought alternatives to releasing families seeking asylum into the U.S., where they were permitted to live for months, and often years, as their cases made their way through backlogged immigration courts.

The administration has argued that most of these people file meritless and even fraudulent claims, and it has taken numerous policy steps to prevent or deter asylum seekers from asking for protection at all.

In the past year, the government has sent more than 61,000 migrants back across the border, where they have been required to wait in violent Mexican border cities while their claims for protection are reviewed, a process that can take months. Immigration court data show that many people placed in the program, as many as half, have since abandoned their asylum claims.

The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in San Francisco, ruled Feb. 28 that the administration must halt the policy, which the court said wasn't permitted under U.S. immigration law or international treaty obligations.

The appeals court had agreed to postpone the effect of its decision temporarily, and it eventually gave the administration a week to seek intervention from the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court is unlikely to give full consideration to the policy until its next term, which begins in October.

A spokeswoman for the Justice Department said the administration was ""gratified"" for the Supreme Court's action.

Dodd-Frank Worsens Covid's Risk

Coronavirus is contagious. So is financial panic.

The spread of the novel coronavirus could cause a run on the financial system leading to a deep recession. Severe stock-market drops and increased demand for liquidity are warning signals. Bank equity capital has increased by $750 billion to $2.1 trillion since 2007, but a panic could still overwhelm well-capitalized banks. We need to restore the weapons to fight contagion that Congress took away during the last financial crisis. Strong pre-emptive action would greatly diminish the risk of a panic.

The previous systemic threat to the financial system was spurred by the failure of Lehman Brothers in 2008. That threat came from within the banking system in the form of bad housing loans. This time is different. Wall Street risk-taking isn't to blame for the coronavirus.

In 2008 the Fed supplied needed liquidity to the banking and nonbanking financial sector, the latter through its authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. Meanwhile, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. expanded the limits of deposit insurance, among other things providing unlimited protection for transaction accounts. The Treasury Department offered guarantees to money-market funds.

Once the crisis abated, however, there was growing public concern about ""moral hazard"" -- that government backstops and guarantees created incentives for risky behavior. In response, the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 limited the Fed's lender-of-last-resort powers for nonbanks, an increasingly important part of the financial system. Fed loans to nonbanks can now be made only with the approval of the Treasury secretary. They must be done through a broad program, unlike the one-off rescue of AIG, and must meet heightened collateral requirements. Loans to nonbanks must be disclosed to congressional leaders within seven days and to the public within one year. Loans to banks must be disclosed within two years. While disclosure is usually desirable, in this situation it creates the specter of future stigma that deters financial institutions from seeking even badly needed Fed funding. Even before the current crisis, banks' use of the discount window had dropped to record lows.

Dodd-Frank also prevents the FDIC from expanding guarantees to bank depositors without congressional approval, as it did in the credit crisis. And the Treasury is now prohibited from guaranteeing money-market funds. These legislative changes make it difficult for the Fed and other regulators to deal effectively with a financial panic.

Government agencies have compounded the problem of their own weakness with regulations that make it harder for financial firms to lend to each other. The liquidity coverage ratio, the Fed liquidity stress tests, and the ""living wills"" process require the largest banks to meet stiff liquidity requirements that can result in liquidity hoarding.

Even before the coronavirus sent markets tumbling, the scarcity of liquidity was a big problem. The 9% spike of overnight repurchase agreement, or repo, rates last September caused the Fed to supply as much as $75 billion a day to the repo market. Although the demand for such support had fallen to about $26 billion by the end of February, it rose to $100 billion on March 4. The Fed responded Monday by raising the minimum support offered to $150 from $100 billion. While this change is welcome, it falls short.

Here's what should be done immediately: First, the Fed should reactivate all the facilities it created in the crisis and any additional ones it believes necessary, so it is ready to be the strongest possible lender of last resort -- to do whatever it takes, consistent with its present legal authority. This includes making U.S. dollars available to other major central banks through currency swaps. And the Treasury secretary should announce his approval of these efforts, consistent with the requirements of Section 13(3). Second, financial regulators should modify their rules and supervision to stimulate liquidity in the interbank and repo markets. Third, Congress should restore all the powers it took away from the Fed, FDIC and Treasury during the crisis. Fourth, international coordination through the Group of 20 must be accelerated. This is a global problem.

China, Europe and Japan already have many of these powers. Policy makers in the U.S. need them too. Bold action can prevent a panic before it starts. The public knows the situation is serious and wants the government to act.

Playground Designed for Resiliency

The conservancy that oversees the Battery in lower Manhattan will break ground on one of the largest climate-change-resilient playgrounds in New York City on Thursday.

The goal for the new $18.3 million playground, which is being called the ""Battery Playscape,"" will be one of the most green and sustainable parks in New York City, according to Battery Conservancy officials.

The 1.5-acre playground will be built within the 25-acre Battery park, which is located in a flood zone at the southern tip of Manhattan. It will sit near the SeaGlass Carousel.

In 2012, superstorm Sandy flooded and damaged a previous playground and other parts of the Battery. After the flooding, the playground was leveled, but later restored. However, the conservancy wanted a new play space that could stand up to heavy rains and storms.

""It will be a model for waterfront parks, a way to embrace resilient design and adapt to climate change,"" Mitchell Silver, said New York City Parks Department Commissioner.

The Parks Department plans to use the resiliency designs for the Battery play space on playgrounds around the city, including East River Park, which soon will be renovated, Mr. Silver said.

Federal and city funds are paying for the Battery Playscape, which is expected to open in spring 2021.

The playground will be divided into five geographic zones: the bluff, marsh, dune, riverbed and meadow. Many of its features will be built above the floodplain. Underground basins will take on excess water, preventing flooding into the city's sewer system. All of the plants for the playground were chosen to resist erosion.

Battery Conservancy President Warrie Price said the best time for children to visit the play space will be after rainfall, because the playground absorbs rainwater and is designed to prevent flooding.

The playground's design team chose flood-resistant materials such as granite and stone, and most of the surface of the park is permeable.

The new playground will be able to withstand future storms, Ms. Price said. ""What we've built is going to be able to recover,"" she said.

U.S. News: Abortion Motive Law Heard By Judges

A federal appeals-court case heard Wednesday in Ohio could help shape a contentious question in abortion law: Should a woman be allowed to terminate a pregnancy because of the fetus's disability, race or gender?

The full Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is considering the validity of an Ohio law that makes it illegal for a physician to perform an abortion on a woman whose motivation is fear that the fetus has Down syndrome. Abortion opponents say the case is winnable in one of the nation's most conservative legal venues and could send the issue to the Supreme Court.

""There's a real chance that they're going to uphold this law,"" said James Bopp, longtime general counsel for the antiabortion National Right to Life Committee organization.

No federal appeals court has upheld such a restraint on abortion, and several federal court rulings have blocked similar provisions enacted elsewhere. The Supreme Court has barred laws that ""place a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.""

Last fall, a three-judge panel from the Sixth Circuit suspended enforcement of Ohio's law because it imposed too much of a burden on women seeking an abortion in violation of Supreme Court precedent. But a majority of the Sixth Circuit's judges then took the unusual step of voting to rehear the case before their entire bench.

Abortion-rights groups argue that limiting the right to terminate a pregnancy before viability is categorically unconstitutional and that Supreme Court precedent doesn't permit such exceptions.

""This law is nothing more than part of a nationwide attempt to push abortion out of reach,"" Alexa Kolbi-Molinas, a senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union, said Tuesday. The ACLU represents abortion clinics challenging the Ohio law.

Lawyers representing the state of Ohio have defended the 2017 measure, signed into law by then-Gov. John Kasich, as an effort to protect a vulnerable population. And antiabortion advocates of the laws say abortion rights aren't so absolute.

They say the Supreme Court has never specifically examined the constitutionality of ""eugenic abortion"" -- the term used by the state of Ohio -- or weighed the government's interest in preventing it.

At least nine states have active laws on the books restricting abortions based on one or more fetal characteristics: the sex or race of the fetus or because of a genetic anomaly, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research group that promotes abortion rights. Some of those statutes haven't faced judicial scrutiny.

Last year, Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri and Utah enacted measures restricting abortions that are solely motivated by the pregnant woman's objections to giving birth to a child with Down syndrome. Kentucky and Missouri also restricted abortions based on the sex or race of the fetus. Utah's law doesn't take effect unless the restriction survives judicial review.

Similar legislation protecting fetuses with genetic anomalies or Down syndrome is pending in at least eight other states, according to the Guttmacher Institute.

In 2018, the Seventh U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago struck down a provision of a 2016 Indiana statute -- signed into law by then-Gov. Mike Pence -- that restricted abortions solely motivated by the fetus's race, sex or disability.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Britain Unveils Stimulus Measures

Britain's government and central bank announced a rare joint stimulus plan to combat the debilitating effects of the coronavirus on the economy.

The move came a day before the European Central Bank was expected to introduce its own package of measures to support swooning economies in the 19-country eurozone. Economists say, though, that central-bank intervention won't be enough, and governments need to step up more aggressively as the economic pain of the virus spreads.

""There's no doubt whatever that this is a situation that calls for Keynesian deficits and not monetary stimulus,"" said Charles Dumas, chief economist at TS Lombard in London.

The Bank of England and the U.K. Treasury announced a joint package of initiatives to support British businesses and households as the virus spreads through the economy.

The BOE followed the Federal Reserve in cutting its benchmark rate by half a percentage point, to 0.25%, the first reduction since summer 2016, and revived a program to support lending to small and midsize businesses. It also trimmed bank capital requirements to further boost credit. It said the measures would allow lenders to extend almost GBP 300 billion ($387 billion) in new loans to companies.

Treasury chief Rishi Sunak announced measures to help businesses, including tax holidays, government refunds for staff sick pay and a GBP 500 million hardship fund to support the neediest workers.

In total, the government has earmarked up to GBP 30 billion of extra spending to combat the coronavirus for the year through March 2021, he said.

U.S. News: Low Rates Won't Fix Housing Market's Strains

With the average rate on a 30-year mortgage falling to 3.29% last week, financing a home purchase has never been cheaper. That could give the flagging economy a much-needed boost amid coronavirus fears.

Yet housing is juicing the economy less than it used to, some economists say. Housing never fully recovered from the 2008 financial crisis, and low rates won't cure its ills. Higher land costs, restrictive zoning, scarce labor and tighter lending standards still limit construction.

In the past, lower rates have helped rev up the housing market, powering the rest of the economy in the process. More homes were built and sold. New homeowners splurged on sofas and washing machines. Existing homeowners refinanced their loans, saving them money to spend on new cars or appliances instead.

The problems began when construction cratered after the housing-market crash that triggered the 2008 financial crisis. Since 2010, only 681,000 new single-family homes were started annually, on average, compared with 1.07 million between 1960 and 2003, the last year before the housing bubble, according to data from the Census Bureau and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Single-family starts totaled around 888,000 houses last year.

""We haven't done nearly as much building relative to the whole economy as we have historically, let alone in expansions,"" said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide.

Residential investment -- which includes single and multifamily construction, remodeling and brokers' fees -- now accounts for 3.1% of gross domestic product, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. That's up from a recent low of 2.4% in 2011 but far below the 5.4% long-term average, based on BEA data.

With construction down, housing is contributing less to growth. Residential investment contributed 0.27 percentage point to the rate of quarterly growth, on average, during expansions between 1950 and 2003, according to BEA data. Since 2010, the first full year of growth after the crisis, the contribution fell to 0.13 percentage point. Last year, declining residential investment shaved 0.6 percentage point off growth.

The economic benefits of housing go beyond construction. In 2015, the buyer of a newly built home spent an average of $4,500 more on appliances, furnishings and renovations than a similar consumer who hadn't just moved, according to a National Association of Home Builders analysis. The buyers of existing houses spent slightly less.

""Whether it's a new or existing home, you're going to pay to fill it up,"" said Mr. Berson. ""New carpeting, window treatments, furniture and furnishings -- these are an important part of the total expenditure on a house.""

Another postcrisis housing trend has also held back growth: More Americans are renting homes and apartments rather than buying. ""The U.S. has become more of a renter nation,"" said Jenny Schuetz, a housing economist at the Brookings Institution.

As buyers vanished after the housing crash, developers built more apartment buildings and fewer single-family homes. The share of new multifamily units added to the housing stock was around 34% in 2009, compared with 24% in 1990, based on data from the Census Bureau and HUD.

Multifamily construction doesn't pack the same economic punch as building single-family homes. Each new multifamily unit creates the equivalent of a single full-time job, on average -- compared with three full-time jobs for a new house, according to Robert Dietz, the NAHB's chief economist.

At the same time, strong demand is driving up rents, leaving occupants less money to spend on other goods or to set aside as a down payment on a home. Between 2000 and 2016, the drop in homeownership among younger adults due to high housing costs translated to around 700,000 fewer home purchases by those in that age group, according to an analysis by Sam Khater, chief economist at mortgage giant Freddie Mac.

Higher prices are largely a result of supply constraints. One of them is a shortage of skilled construction workers. Another is restrictive building and zoning codes in major cities such as New York and Los Angeles, which have increasingly become centers of job growth and prosperity.

""All of this has made home construction more expensive, and therefore less profitable,"" said Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin, an online real-estate brokerage. ""That's partly why it's contributing less to GDP.""

To be sure, the economy still stands to benefit from ultralow rates as homeowners refinance, which reduces their monthly payments, freeing up income to spend. And online mortgage lender Better.com, which averages around $700 million in loans a month, says application volume in the first 10 days of March nearly surpassed the total for all of February. Though refinancing has spurred much of that, new applications have surged too, the company says.

U.S. News: Canadian CEO to Plead Guilty In College Admissions Scandal

A Canadian businessman is expected to plead guilty to fraud conspiracy after being accused of having someone else take the SAT on behalf of his two sons.

Prosecutors say David Sidoo, a Vancouver father who also played pro football in Canada, paid $200,000 to William ""Rick"" Singer, mastermind of the college admissions cheating scheme, who in turn paid a test-taking whiz to sit for the standardized exams in place of his sons.

A Wednesday court filing indicates Mr. Sidoo will appear before a federal judge in Boston to formally enter a guilty plea Friday. According to his plea agreement, prosecutors and Mr. Sidoo are jointly recommending a sentence of 90 days in prison, a $250,000 fine and one year of supervised release.

""His desire is to seek finality to this process,"" said Mr. Sidoo's attorney, Martin Weinberg.

Mr. Sidoo was one of 36 parents charged in connection to the case, which was unveiled by federal authorities last March.

He is the 22nd to plead guilty or agree to do so.

All but one parent sentenced in the case so far have received prison terms, ranging from two weeks to nine months.

Other parents who have pleaded not guilty are scheduled to go to trial in two groups, in October and January.

Mr. Sidoo stepped down as chief executive of East West Petroleum Corp. after charges were announced.

Prosecutors say Mark Riddell used fake IDs with his picture and Mr. Sidoo's sons' names to take the SAT in Vancouver in 2011 and in California in 2012.

Mr. Riddell has pleaded guilty to taking the exams on behalf of the teens and, later, working as a test proctor for other clients of Mr. Singer's.

Mr. Singer shifted his approach after testing agencies tightened security, having Mr. Riddell fix wrong answers after the fact or feed the answers to students instead of standing in for them.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Taxpayer Cushion Sought in a Later Deadline

WASHINGTON -- Tax professionals' frenzied period before the April 15 tax deadline will likely be stretched over a longer time frame, offering a cash cushion to some taxpayers and easing the need for face-to-face contacts that could spread the novel coronavirus.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Wednesday he is recommending that President Trump delay certain tax-payment deadlines, except for the ""superrich"" and large businesses. He said the move would keep money in taxpayers' hands at a time when the economy may struggle.

The administration hasn't yet announced details of how the delay would work or how long it would last. The tax code allows the Internal Revenue Service to delay some deadlines for up to six months without a disaster declaration and offers broader authority to delay payments, interest and penalties for up to one year if the president does declare a disaster.

""For small and medium-sized businesses, for hardworking individuals, we are going to recommend to the president that we allow the delay and that they don't have to pay any interest or penalty on that,"" Mr. Mnuchin told reporters Wednesday following a congressional hearing. ""That will have the impact of putting over $200 billion back into the economy.""

Generally, early returns are filed by taxpayers with lower incomes and those who count on refunds. People with more complicated returns and those who owe money tend to file closer to April 15. Some pay taxes they owe by April 15 and file a return by mid-October.

""While providing penalty relief is insufficient to address this crisis alone, it would at least lift one burden off the backs of taxpayers, who are trying to keep themselves and their loved ones safe,"" Democratic senators, led by Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Patty Murray of Washington, wrote in a letter to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig on Wednesday.

State tax authorities often follow federal definitions and deadlines, though in most cases they would need to act separately to change filing and payment dates, said Verenda Smith of the Federation of Tax Administrators.

The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants offered its recommendations on Wednesday. Those include letting people extend tax filing until Oct. 15 without filing a form, waiving interest through Oct. 15 and waiving some penalties for late payments and underpayments.

Any delay would disrupt the routines of tax preparers and accountants.

""It will be a total disaster,"" said Janet Hagy, an accountant in Austin, Texas. ""So many clients procrastinate, and we're already in the funnel leading to April 15. An extension will just prolong the pain.""

Andy Mattson, an accountant with Moss Adams LLP in Campbell, Calif., said an extension of the deadline would come as a relief for many firms, especially smaller ones.

""Without an extension, it will be hard for many tax firms to meet the April 15 deadline,"" he said. ""Clients often prefer to mail confidential information to the office rather than email it.""

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Coronavirus Declared to Be A Pandemic

The spread of the new coronavirus has reached a pandemic, spanning 112 countries and regions, the World Health Organization declared, as disruptions to daily life ricocheted around the world.

The WHO generally defines a pandemic as a disease that has become widespread around the world, with an impact on society. The term has been applied to only a few diseases in history -- a deadly flu in 1918, the H1N1 flu in 2009 and HIV/AIDS among them.

""We're deeply concerned, both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction,"" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. ""We have never before seen a pandemic sparked by a coronavirus.""

President Trump on Wednesday announced a 30-day ban on travel from Europe to the U.S. in an effort to mitigate the impact of the virus.

Italy ordered all shops except for food stores and pharmacies to close, deepening its nationwide lockdown. Large gatherings were banned in many cities. Additional schools closed. The Chicago and New York City St. Patrick's Day parades have been put off. The National Basketball Association suspended its season.

By Wednesday night, global confirmed cases had grown to over 126,000, with more than 4,500 deaths, data compiled by Johns Hopkins University showed.

Still, Dr. Tedros said, the new coronavirus can be stopped if governments move swiftly and decisively.

The pandemic label doesn't require new WHO recommendations. But the move could get more resources to a rapidly worsening situation, some health experts said.

""I hope that it adds urgency to efforts to mitigate it, because those efforts need urgency,"" said Marc Lipsitch, professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics.

On a call with reporters, Dr. Lipsitch said he believes there are thousands of people in the U.S. infected with the new coronavirus who haven't been tested. There were 1,311 confirmed cases in the U.S. Wednesday night, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins. The death toll grew to at least 36.

Public-health leaders, businesses and individuals should move more aggressively to prevent further spread rather than focusing on containing known clusters, Dr. Lipsitch said. That means canceling more large gatherings, reducing travel, implementing policies that encourage people to stay home when sick, and otherwise reducing social contact such as handshaking.

On Wednesday, San Francisco Mayor London Breed said events with 1,000 or more people would be prohibited. Kentucky's governor became the first in the nation to call publicly on churches to cancel services this Sunday.

""I don't believe that whether you go to church during this time is a test of faith,"" Gov. Andy Beshear said.

In Washington state, the site of one of the largest outbreaks in the country, where cases grew to 366 on Wednesday, Gov. Jay Inslee moved to prohibit gatherings of 250 people or more across three counties. In King County, where at least 234 people have tested positive and 26 have died, plans were made to ban events with even fewer attendees unless they meet certain health guidelines.

Seattle Public Schools, the state's largest school district with more than 53,600 students, said it would close all schools for at least 14 days, starting Thursday. Last week, a district in the city's northern suburbs directed students to stay home -- a measure, officials said on Wednesday, that has so far proved effective.

The moves follow similar containment measures in Europe and Asia.

China, where the outbreak began in December, has all but declared victory over the disease as the number of new cases has dropped sharply after the country's hard-line response to the pathogen. China's National Health Commission reported on Wednesday 24 new infections, 10 of them imported -- highlighting how the epidemic has evolved and shifted.

Iran confirmed 63 new deaths, the highest single-day toll there since the new coronavirus appeared three weeks ago, as total infections reached 9,000. Japan reported its second-biggest one-day rise in confirmed cases thus far, taking the country's total to 568. South Korea -- trailing only China, Italy and Iran in cases -- reported 242 more on Wednesday, bringing its total to 7,755.

In Italy, where the largest outbreak outside of China pushed the country to implement an unprecedented nationwide quarantine, the number of cases climbed on Wednesday to 12,462, with 827 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins data. In Germany, cases increased to 1,908 and officials said they expected the number to rise.

""As long as there is no immunity in the population, no vaccines and no therapy, then a high percentage of the population -- experts say 60% to 70% -- will become infected,"" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: House Democrats Lay Out Priorities On an Aid Package

WASHINGTON -- House Democrats rushed to complete an economic package responding to the spread of the new coronavirus and win support from the Trump administration before a scheduled weeklong break.

The package House Democrats prepared and released late Wednesday would provide for paid sick leave for people affected by the coronavirus and expand unemployment insurance, among other measures. The legislation reflects a series of priorities House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) laid out at the start of the week.

Democratic lawmakers plan to pass it on the floor Thursday, though it's unclear how much Republican support it will have.

Lawmakers were hoping to release the bill Wednesday and pass it on the floor Thursday. Mrs. Pelosi spoke with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin twice on Wednesday as Democrats sought backing from the administration on the legislation. She also met with Mr. Mnuchin on Tuesday.

Republicans were also considering policy steps Wednesday evening, leaving open the possibility that Capitol Hill could cobble together a bipartisan compromise to address the economic consequences of the pandemic in just a matter of days. House Republican leadership met Wednesday to discuss possible legislation, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) was in contact with Mr. Mnuchin on Wednesday.

Prospects of a bipartisan agreement have fallen to Mr. Mnuchin and Mrs. Pelosi. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said he would defer to the Trump administration, and House Republicans indicated they would also fall in line behind the White House.

Democrats and the administration agree on the need to expand paid sick leave as lawmakers worry about hourly-wage earners who may continue to go to work even if they contract the disease. Larry Kudlow, the director of the White House National Economic Council, told reporters Tuesday evening that the administration was also hoping to take action to assist workers who don't have paid sick leave, though he said that could be done without Congress.

The House Democratic plan calls for up to three months of paid leave for workers who are infected, in quarantine, taking care of children, or caring for a loved one who is sick, according to a congressional aide. It would replace two-thirds of wages with a $4,000 a month cap for workers not already receiving wages or paid leave, according to the aide. The plan also includes roughly $1 billion in assistance for nutrition programs, according to a person familiar with the proposal.

White House officials were still reviewing the House proposal Wednesday night, but a person familiar with the matter said some officials in the building weren't keen on it

Weinstein Sentenced to 23 Years In Prison for Sexual Assaults

Harvey Weinstein, the once-powerful and internationally acclaimed Hollywood producer, was sentenced to 23 years in prison following a conviction stemming from sexual-assault allegations that sparked the #MeToo movement.

The sentence marks a shocking turn for Mr. Weinstein, 67 years old, who was viewed as one of Hollywood's most skilled executives until a wave of women accused him of sexual misconduct beginning in 2017. His Oscar-winning hits included ""Shakespeare in Love"" and ""Pulp Fiction.""

A Manhattan jury convicted Mr. Weinstein last month on two counts: first-degree criminal sexual act, for forcing oral sex on ""Project Runway"" production assistant Miriam Haley in 2006; and third-degree rape, for having nonconsensual sex with then-aspiring actress Jessica Mann in 2013.

He was acquitted of the most severe charges -- two counts of predatory sexual assault, which carried a possible life sentence. The jury ultimately decided against convicting Mr. Weinstein of raping former ""Sopranos"" star Annabella Sciorra in the early 1990s.

New York Supreme Court Justice James Burke sentenced Mr. Weinstein to 20 years on the charge of criminal sexual act and three years on the third-degree rape, to be served back to back. The maximum sentence for each count was 25 years and four years, respectively.

The judge said the sentence reflected evidence that Mr. Weinstein had sexually assaulted other women beyond the allegations for which he was convicted.

""Although this is a first conviction, it is not a first offense,"" Justice Burke said.

The Hollywood producer, who arrived by wheelchair, addressed the allegations for the first time in court, expressing ""great remorse for all the women who are going through this crisis,"" but not apologizing or admitting he committed a crime.

He said the #MeToo movement had stripped men of due process and compared it to how communists were once treated.

""Now, there are thousands of men who have been accused of things that none of us understood,"" he said.

Turning to the front row, where six women who testified against him sat with Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, he said: ""My empathy has grown.""

Mr. Weinstein still faces criminal prosecution on similar allegations in Los Angeles, where the district attorney's office said Wednesday it had begun the process of extraditing him from New York and bringing him to California for court proceedings. He has denied any nonconsensual sexual encounters.

Mr. Weinstein's accusers wept and embraced each other after Justice Burke imposed the sentence and deemed him a convicted sex offender.

Spectators cheered in the courthouse hallway as the women walked out of the courtroom for the last time.

Mr. Weinstein, promptly wheeled out of the room by court officers, was ""blown away"" by the harsh sentence, according to defense attorney Arthur Aidala.

He said 23 years is three times the average sentence for the crime the producer was convicted of. His attorneys plan to appeal his conviction.

He was taken to Manhattan's Rikers Island jail facility Wednesday and is expected to be transferred to Fishkill Correctional Facility, a prison about 65 miles north of New York City, his lawyers said.

The sentence followed a seven-week trial.

Prosecutors called 28 witnesses to the stand, including six women who offered gripping testimony alleging sexual misconduct by Mr. Weinstein. The defense team tried to undermine the women during lengthy cross examinations, pointing to their yearslong consensual relationships that continued after the alleged attacks. Both Ms. Haley and Ms. Mann gave impassioned statements to the court describing the impact of Mr. Weinstein's crimes.

Ms. Haley described how her assault altered the course of her life and said she was confident Mr. Weinstein would continue to offend if he wasn't behind bars.

""I am relieved to know he's not out there, feeling even more empowered,"" she said. ""He will now know he's not above the law.""

During the proceeding, Mr. Weinstein turned toward Ms. Mann when she began delivering a statement about a sexual assault that occurred during their yearslong relationship. The hairstylist recounted Mr. Weinstein's ""ox-like"" strength and explained that ""fight and flight"" weren't possible during her attack. She described her testimony as painful but empowering.

""Rape is not just one moment of penetration,"" she said. ""The impact will last a lifetime.""

Lead defense attorney Donna Rotunno had asked Justice Burke to sentence Mr. Weinstein to the minimum of five years, citing his professional accomplishments and the impact his incarceration would have on his youngest children, aged six and nine. Given his age and deteriorating health, it is possible he wouldn't live to see the end of a five-year sentence.

But Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi said Mr. Weinstein had been ""using and abusing people his entire life,"" reading from a lengthy list of quotes describing him: ""a devil,"" ""a frightening power addict,"" ""a screaming bully,"" ""extremely temperamental,"" ""a rapist.""

""This is the life this man has led,"" she said.

U.S. News: Budget Deficit Grew 15% for First 5 Months

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. budget deficit totaled $625 billion in the first five months of this fiscal year, a 15% increase over the same period in 2019, the U.S. Treasury reported Wednesday.

The deficit grew by $235 billion in February, roughly on par with February 2019. The U.S. fiscal year begins in October.

Government revenue rose to $188 billion in February, a 12% increase over the same month in 2019. For the whole five-month period, revenue rose 7% to $1.37 trillion, thanks to a strong economy that fattened payrolls and delivered wage gains.

Spending is also up this fiscal year, climbing 9% to $1.99 trillion. The rise in spending was largely driven by outlays in health care and Social Security spending as well as more spending on the military and veterans' affairs.

Deficits typically narrow when the economy is strong, as rising household income and corporate profits bolster government revenue, and spending on safety-net programs such as unemployment insurance declines. Instead, deficits have been rising in recent years amid a surge in government spending and weaker-than-expected receipts following the tax cuts enacted in 2017.

The government expects the deficit to hit $1.08 trillion this fiscal year, up from $984 billion during the 2019 fiscal year.

Trump Curtails Travel From Europe

WASHINGTON -- President Trump announced a 30-day ban on some travel from Europe into the U.S. and said he would take action to offer financial assistance to those affected by the coronavirus pandemic in an effort to mitigate the impact of the virus that is rapidly spreading across the country and around the world.

Mr. Trump, in a nationally televised address from the Oval Office on Wednesday, said the travel suspension would begin Friday night at midnight and wouldn't apply to the U.K.

The president suggested the restrictions would also apply to cargo shipped into the U.S. from Europe, but the White House later said the restrictions applied only to people and declined to answer other questions.

""The restriction stops people not goods,"" Mr. Trump later tweeted.

The president's comments came as the virus has spread to more than 100 countries, roiled markets and disrupted daily life across the country and around the world.

By Wednesday night, global confirmed cases had grown to 126,135, more than 1,300 of them in the U.S., data compiled by Johns Hopkins University showed. More than 4,600 people have died.

Mr. Trump's address marked his most direct response to the health crisis to date, though he tried to sound an optimistic note and defended the actions that have already been taken by his administration.

""This is not a financial crisis,"" Mr. Trump said. ""This is just a temporary moment in time that we will overcome as a nation, and as a world.""

U.S. futures and global stock markets dropped after the president announced the new travel restrictions.

Hours after Mr. Trump's address, the State Department advised U.S. citizens against all travel abroad, even to countries not yet experiencing a coronavirus outbreak. The department warned of mandatory quarantines, travel restrictions and other measures that could complicate international travel.

The restrictions and the travel warning were sure to hurt the airline industry, which has seen travel plummet as the virus has taken hold.

The Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday night said the travel-restriction proclamation signed by the president applies to most foreign nationals who have been in European countries at any point during the 14 days prior to their scheduled arrival to the United States.

The ban applies to the 26 European countries in the Schengen Area, a zone without border controls where people can travel freely from country to country. The U.K. is not inside the Schengen Area, though the country hasn't escaped coronavirus.

U.S. citizens and green-card holders are exempted from the temporary ban, as are their spouses and children. Citizens and green-card holders who are under the age of 21 are also eligible to bring parents into the U.S. Passengers on flights that take off Friday before midnight will still be eligible to enter the U.S., even if they land after the ban takes effect.

Europe is the most-visited regional destination for U.S. travelers in the world, according to U.S. Transportation Department data. More than 72 million passengers traveled from the U.S. to Europe in the year ending June 2019.

Airlines scrambled to understand what Mr. Trump's announcement would mean for their operations. Carriers have already announced cuts to flying capacity all over the world due to flagging demand, but had planned to continue operating some flights to and from Europe.

""We are in contact with the federal government to understand and comply with this directive. The health and safety of our customers and team members remains our highest priority,"" American Airlines Group Inc. said in a statement.

Mr. Trump, who spoke for about 10 minutes, also said he would ask Congress to take emergency action ""to ensure that working Americans impacted by the virus can stay home without fear of financial hardship."" He said aid would be targeted for workers who are ill, quarantined or caring for others.

Last year, 24% of U.S. workers, or about 33.6 million Americans, did not receive paid sick leave from their employer, the Labor Department said. Those without the benefit are concentrated in lower-wage and front-line service sector positions.

Mr. Trump also said he would instruct the Internal Revenue Service to push back the April 15 tax-payment deadline for certain individuals and businesses, providing a cash cushion for taxpayers at a time when the economy may falter.

Mr. Trump said the Small Business Administration would begin offering low-interest loans to help small businesses overcome temporary economic disruptions. He said the administration planned to ask Congress to authorize an additional $50 billion for the lending program.

The president urged Congress to approve payroll tax relief, a proposal that faces resistance from Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill.

Mr. Trump said insurers had agreed to waive copayment for coronavirus treatment. But America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group for the industry, pointed to a press conference Tuesday where Vice President Mike Pence said insurers had agreed only to waive copays for coronavirus testing.

Mr. Trump faces not only a national health problem but a political test as he heads deeper into the re-election campaign. His chief rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, is set to give a speech on coronavirus Thursday in Wilmington, Del.

After the president's address, the White House said that out of caution over the coronavirus, Mr. Trump canceled travel for events in Colorado and Nevada that was to begin Thursday.

Earlier in the day, the president said at a meeting with banking executives at the White House that one of the reasons the virus was spreading rapidly was the ease with which travelers can cross borders, according to people familiar with the matter.

The IRS Proves the Left's Favorite Economists Wrong

'The Rich Really Do Pay Lower Taxes Than You"" read a headline in the New York Times last fall. This astounding claim, presented in the media as fact and evidence of inequities baked into President Trump's 2017 tax cut, came from two economists at the University of California, Berkeley. Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman asserted that 2018 was the first year in U.S. history that the average tax rate on the 400 wealthiest income earners dipped below the rates paid by the lower-middle class and poor.

Finally, we had proof the rich weren't paying their fair share. But new data from the Internal Revenue Service suggest it isn't true.

The Saez-Zucman analysis raised eyebrows among other economists who study tax data, in part because they claimed it reflected the first full year under the new tax rates. At the time they published their study, the IRS had yet to release the data necessary to make the calculations they described. Preliminary numbers for 2018 income-tax returns, covering all filings made by last year's Oct. 15 extended deadline, came out only last week. These data tell a very different story: America's wealthiest earners still carry the lion's share of the tax burden.

Closer inspection reveals that Messrs. Saez and Zucman imputed the tax rates they claim for 2018 from records that predated the Trump tax cut, and therefore didn't capture its effect on the measured distribution of income. They built in opaque assumptions that now appear to have exaggerated the tax cut's benefit to high-income earners.

This wasn't the only problem with the Saez-Zucman statistics. Their alleged 23% tax rate paid by the highest earners -- encompassing all federal, state and local taxes -- fell below the Congressional Budget Office's estimates for the top income percentile's federal tax rate alone. The two economists' tax rates for the poor also looked suspiciously high. A 25% rate for the lowest quintile of earners would be almost twice the level found in other estimates, including those using better-established data from the Congressional Budget Office and the nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. The discrepancy arose from Messrs. Saez and Zucman's exclusion of the earned-income tax credit for low-income households, artificially inflating the amount of tax the poor really pay.

The new IRS numbers now provide reason to doubt Messrs. Saez and Zucman's entire narrative of a regressive U.S. tax system designed to favor the rich at the expense of the poor. The IRS reports effective income-tax rates on the adjusted gross incomes of different groups of earners. That's the percentage of income that people actually pay to the government, as distinct from the statutory tax rate.

According to the IRS, the top 0.01% of earners -- those with incomes above $10 million -- paid a 24.8% effective federal income-tax rate in 2018. This isn't very different from the 25.3% the group paid in 2017, and is higher than the average rate of 22.5% on the same group during the George W. Bush administration. As these rates only encompass federal income taxes, most filers can expect to add another 8% to 12% of income from other forms of taxation, placing their total burden well above the Saez-Zucman numbers.

How does that affect the claims of regressivity? It's true the remainder of the top 1% (those with incomes between roughly $500,000 and $10 million) paid a slightly higher effective rate, at 26.5%, than the top 0.01% did. But tax rates drop rapidly from there, with filers in the $50,000 to $75,000 reporting bracket (approximately the median U.S. family income) facing an average federal income-tax rate of 8.4%.

People who earned between $15,000 and $40,000 paid an average federal rate of merely 4% of their adjusted gross incomes in 2018. And thanks to the earned-income tax credit and others like it, the poorest earners paid very little if any federal income tax at all.

In short, the federal income-tax structure still places the unambiguous bulk of its burden on the highest earners. The Trump tax cut hasn't changed that. In 2018, the top 1% of U.S. earners paid roughly 37% of all federal income taxes. The top 5% paid around 58%. This suggests that policy makers wishing to mitigate regressive features of the tax system should look elsewhere. State and local sales and property taxes may be a more promising area for reform.

The IRS's preliminary data also suggests that the needle on income inequality -- the motive force behind the Saez-Zucman research and the wealth-tax proposals it has been used to support -- hasn't moved lately. The share of adjusted gross income that went to the top 1% in 2018 was essentially the same as it was a decade earlier, at least going by the IRS numbers. The same is true of the top 0.1% and even the top 0.01%, the ultrarich so often targeted in political rhetoric from the left.

The full economic effects of the Trump tax cut extend beyond personal income-tax rates, and will be seen in the data only when future statistical releases become available. The corporate income-tax cut, for example, will likely prompt high earners to shift income from their personal returns to corporate returns, further lowering the measured income shares of the top 1%. Ironically, the reduction in the corporate tax rate could lead to a statistical reduction in income inequality.

In their rush to embrace a convenient political narrative last fall, much of the press and political classes never considered the possibility that the data would undermine their story. It did.

U.S. News: Home Sales Face New Uncertainty

The lowest mortgage rates on record are colliding with the prospect of an economic downturn prompted by the coronavirus pandemic, setting the stage for an unpredictable spring selling season in the housing market.

Early indications suggest rock-bottom borrowing costs may not be enough to lure many home buyers amid the current uncertainty. Economists are tamping down earlier expectations that cheap rates and a strong job market would boost the housing market in 2020 following years of sluggish growth.

The National Association of Realtors had anticipated about 5.5 million sales of previously owned homes in 2020, up from 5.3 million a year in 2019 and 2018, said NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun.

""I thought that there would be a steady increase from January pretty much throughout most of the year,"" Mr. Yun said. ""Obviously, we hit a major speed bump"" because of the new coronavirus.

The association said Monday that it expected a 10% drop in home sales in the next month, compared with the period before the coronavirus became prominent. In a survey of its members about the virus, the association said 11% of respondents reported lower home-buyer traffic and 7% reported lower home-seller traffic.

The spring months are crucial for home sales, as buyers look to move into new homes before the start of the school year. About 40% of annual sales take place from March through June, according to NAR.

Some agents say the virus is causing clients to avoid public gatherings, including open houses.

David Kong, an agent at real-estate brokerage Keller Williams NYC, got a call last week from a client asking to cancel her open house. The client, Jodi Freed, a party planner from Queens, N.Y., said she was concerned about having strangers in the home where she and her family still live, because her teenage children have health conditions.

""It's pretty much put our life on hold,"" she said. ""If I can't sell the house, I can't move.""

Real-estate brokerage Redfin Corp. said last week that a handful of buyers had suspended their home searches due to the virus, while three sellers in Seattle canceled listings. Redfin has encouraged home shoppers to use video chat to tour homes virtually.

The biggest problem in the housing market is a shortage of homes for sale, ""and the coronavirus I think will exacerbate that, because it's the sellers who are hesitant to put their homes on the market,"" said Redfin Chief Executive Glenn Kelman.

The U.S. housing inventory in January was at the lowest level for that month since 1999, according to NAR. The U.S. had 3.1 months of supply of homes on the market at the end of January, down from 3.8 months a year earlier.

In February, the number of homes for sale fell by more than 20% in half of the nation's 50 biggest metro areas compared with a year earlier, according to Realtor.com. (News Corp, parent of The Wall Street Journal, operates Realtor.com.)

The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 3.29% last week, the lowest level on record, said mortgage-finance giant Freddie Mac. Mortgages rates are closely linked to yields on the 10-year Treasury, which hit a record low Monday.

Low mortgage rates have led to a boom in refinancing, and they typically increase home sales too. A 3.3% rate on a $300,000 loan would create a monthly payment of $1,314, according to LendingTree Inc., an online loan information site. At 4%, the monthly payment would be $1,432. (Both figures exclude taxes and insurance.)

King County, Wash., which includes Seattle, has confirmed more than 100 Covid-19 cases, and some schools have closed. But the housing market hasn't slowed, said Matt van Winkle, chief executive of Re/Max Northwest.

""We're still seeing properties sell in the first day or two when they come on the market,"" he said.

Potomac Watch
Adam Schiff's Surveillance State

Lawmakers are debating ways to prevent the Federal Bureau of Investigation from abusing its surveillance authority again. While they're at it, they have an obligation to address their own privacy transgressor, Rep. Adam Schiff.

That's the gist of a pointed letter from Federal Communications Commissioner Brendan Carr, which landed Thursday at the House Intelligence Committee. Chairman Schiff spent months conducting secret impeachment hearings. His ensuing report revealed that he'd also set up his own surveillance state. Mr. Schiff issued secret subpoenas to phone carriers, to obtain and publish the call records of political rivals. Targets included Rudy Giuliani and another attorney of the president, the ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee (Rep. Devin Nunes) and a journalist (John Solomon).

Impeachment is over, but Mr. Carr hasn't forgotten this abuse of power, and his letter, which I obtained, calls for answers and reform. The FCC takes call privacy seriously, only recently having proposed some $200 million in fines on phone carriers for failing to protect customer data. Mr. Carr's message to Mr. Schiff is that Congress doesn't get a pass. It is not automatically entitled to ""a secret and partisan process that deprives Americans of their legal right to maintain the privacy of this sensitive information.""

Mr. Carr doesn't dispute that Congress may, ""in at least some circumstances,"" have the legal authority to obtain call records under the Communications Act. The offense, he writes, was denying his targets the right to fight the subpoenas: ""Courts long ago established a process for Americans to seek judicial review before Congress obtains and then publishes documents in response to a congressional subpoena.""

As a lawyer and congressional lifer, Mr. Schiff knows this. It's expected that Congress give notice of demands, as it did when it issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank and Mazars for Donald Trump's financial records. That notice allowed the president to file suit to block those institutions from responding. The Supreme Court in December issued stays, halting Deutsche Bank and Mazars compliance while it considers Mr. Trump's appeal. Oral arguments are scheduled for March 31. Congress isn't entitled to everything.

This history is what made Mr. Schiff's subpoenas so devious and abusive. He issued them secretly. He didn't notify his targets, and Republican committee members were barred from telling the public what they knew about the subpoenas.

Worse, he deceived one of his targets. He sent a subpoena for call records to Mr. Giuliani on Sept. 30 and suggested Mr. Giuliani had two weeks to work with the committee, even as Mr. Schiff was already secretly demanding Giuliani call records from a phone carrier.

House Democrats suggest this cloak-and-dagger was necessary for their investigation. Mr. Carr punctures that absurd claim. Yes, law enforcement sometimes needs secrecy in surveillance warrants, so as to freely monitor ""real time"" on continuing communications. But Mr. Schiff was seeking past call data. Telling Mr. Giuliani about the carrier subpoenas wouldn't change the call-record history. The only reason to keep him in the dark was to strip him of the right to litigate.

Mr. Carr details how many legal issues Mr. Schiff denied his targets the opportunity to test. He notes that the Supreme Court is considering the limits on congressional subpoena authority in Trump v. Mazars and Trump v. Deutsche Bank, and that the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia last month dismissed a House lawsuit to compel testimony from former White House counsel Don McGahn. Mr. Carr also points out the heightened First Amendment questions that accompanied Mr. Schiff's acquisition and publication of records for an investigative journalist -- one who was writing stories critical of Mr. Schiff.

And he asks whether Mr. Schiff exceeded his authority by publishing call records that lack ""any apparent nexus to the Committee's legitimate work."" That includes a drive-by smear of Mr. Nunes. In Watkins v. U.S. (1957), the Supreme Court held that ""there is no congressional power to expose for the sake of exposure,"" especially when ""the predominant result can only be the invasion of the private rights of individuals.""

Meanwhile, Mr. Carr asks: Is Mr. Schiff continuing to issue secret subpoenas? And what else is he sitting on? The impeachment report indicates the committee obtained ""nearly 4,000 pages of confidential call records,"" nowhere near what Mr. Schiff published. Who else's life is getting ransacked at this moment?

""The Committee created out of whole cloth a secret and effectively unreviewable and unchecked mechanism for obtaining call records on any and all Americans,"" Mr. Carr writes. He holds out the possibility the FCC will modify its rules to check such abuse.

But he also suggests Congress take the question up as part of its surveillance debate. That's the better forum, and it ought to be as big a priority for Republicans as reform of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. The House has little credibility to lecture the FBI on surveillance abuse if it won't rein in its own snoopers.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Travel Ban Fuels Tensions With Europe

Corrections & Amplifications

The European Commission president and European Council president said in a statement: ""The European Union disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation."" A Coronavirus Pandemic article Friday about tensions between the U.S. and the EU incorrectly quoted the statement as saying improve rather than impose.

(WSJ March 14, 2020)

(END)

President Trump's announced travel ban on Europe, beyond surprising European capitals, deepens tensions among trans-Atlantic allies whose ties already are strained over trade, security, climate change and what Europeans say is the U.S. failure to consult them.

European governments complained that the announcement, made early Thursday Europe time, came without notice and coordination on what is a global health problem. Moreover, the U.S. ban, European Union leaders said, directly affects European citizens, barring many of them from travel to the U.S., and disregards the EU's ""strong action"" to contain the new coronavirus.

Mr. Trump defended the ban and the timing, saying the situation demanded fast action so not all European leaders could be notified.

""We had to make a decision and I didn't want to take time, and, you know, it takes a lot of time to make the individual calls, and we are calling, and we have spoken to some of them prior to. . . . But we had to move quickly,"" Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he met with the prime minister of Ireland, whose citizens aren't affected by the ban.

The ban -- which covers most non-U.S. citizens who have traveled through 26 European countries -- comes on top of other U.S. decisions made unilaterally under Mr. Trump that have dismayed European leaders.

Some decisions, including the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate accord and the multinational Iran nuclear deal, followed pledges Mr. Trump made during his 2016 run for president.

Other decisions, such as his placing of tariffs on European steel and aluminum, which Mr. Trump justified on national-security grounds, stunned EU leaders, who note that Europe contributes to U.S. security by participating in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other alliances.

Mr. Trump has jangled European nerves by criticizing those contributions as insufficient and by threatening to impose tariffs on European cars, also on national-security grounds.

EU leaders and officials said imposing the travel ban without consultation is particularly counterproductive because governments need to work together to stem the spread of the new coronavirus.

Mr. Trump's decision rankled further because he said the EU failed to restrict travel from China and contain the virus, which, he said, then seeded outbreaks in the U.S.

The EU wouldn't comment on Mr. Trump's comments.

German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said: ""I believe we are dealing with a global issue and a global challenge. We don't do it justice, including in the U.S., by taking decisions that are garnished with blame.""

The coronavirus crisis ""requires cooperation rather than unilateral action,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel said in a statement. ""The European Union disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to improve a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation.""

A spokesman for the European Commission, the EU's executive, said officials were still seeking to understand the scope and consequences of the U.S. decision. Eric Mamer, the chief spokesman said there were no immediate plans for any retaliatory steps but didn't rule that out.

Mr. Trump repeatedly has accused the EU and European countries of taking advantage of the U.S. on defense and trade. European nations have pledged significant defense spending increases. On trade, the two sides recently hoped to reach agreement later this month to avert fresh U.S. tariffs on EU products, though that target date now looks doubtful.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: High Court Is Closed To Public For Now

WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court and other federal courts in the nation's capital will close to the public indefinitely, allowing access only to those with official business, as authorities tried to stanch the coronavirus pandemic.

""Out of concern for the health and safety of the public and Supreme Court employees, the Supreme Court Building will be closed to the public from 4:30 p.m. on March 12, 2020, until further notice,"" the Supreme Court said Thursday.

The landmark building opposite the Capitol is a major tourist attraction, and its public floors include exhibits and offer lectures and educational programs. Those have been canceled indefinitely, the court said.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, the U.S. District Court and the federal bankruptcy court, which are based at the E. Barrett Prettyman Courthouse, announced a similar policy.

The courts are not suspending their own business. The Supreme Court advised attorneys that case filing deadlines weren't being extended.

Credentialed journalists will be able to enter court buildings, but the level of public access to proceedings was unclear. The Sixth Amendment provides criminal defendants ""the right to a speedy and public trial,"" and the Supreme Court has held that the public has a right to attend such proceedings.

In May 2018, under a policy spearheaded by then-Chief Judge Merrick Garland, the D.C. Circuit began streaming live audio of all its arguments through the court website. The district court, which conducts trials, doesn't provide audio of its proceedings. A district court spokeswoman couldn't be reached.

The Supreme Court is next scheduled to hear oral arguments on March 23, beginning a two-week sitting that will include several significant cases, including legal actions filed by President Trump to prevent Deutsche Bank AG and the Mazars accounting firm from turning over his financial records under subpoenas from House committees and a New York state grand jury.

The moves in Washington, D.C., come as federal courts across the country have been limiting access to courtrooms and delaying trials and proceedings. In Washington state, with one of the most severe outbreaks in the U.S., the federal courts have postponed all in-person civil and criminal proceedings in Seattle and Tacoma, and suspended grand jury meetings.

PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron delivered a national address that called for international cooperation in the fight against the new coronavirus.

Speaking on national television Thursday, Mr. Macron cast France's struggle to slow the rate of infections as an effort that would require collective national action.

He announced a nationwide shutdown of the school system starting Monday and urged people over the age of 70 and anyone with chronic diseases or respiratory ailments to remain at home.

""We are only at the beginning of the epidemic. Everywhere in Europe it is accelerating,"" Mr. Macron said.

However Mr. Macron also portrayed the coronavirus as a challenge in need of a global solution, just one day after President Trump described it as a foreign virus that had arrived on U.S. shores.

""This virus doesn't have a passport,"" Mr. Macron said, adding that he planned to speak to Mr. Trump on Friday. ""Being divided won't allow us to respond to what's a global crisis.""

Mr. Macron said he might need to limit travel to areas in France that are severely affected by the virus. Any decision to close national borders, Mr. Macron said, will occur ""only when relevant"" and will be coordinated ""at the European level.""

The Coronavirus Pandmemic: ECB Offers Stimulus, but Plan Draws Criticism

FRANKFURT -- European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde unveiled a modest stimulus package to shield the region's economy from the fast-spreading coronavirus, but the action raised concerns the central bank may be unwilling or unable to move forcefully against a shock that has ricocheted through Europe.

Ms. Lagarde emphasized the limits of what the ECB can do to mitigate the economic damage of the virus, remarks that suggested she might be less willing to use the sort of extraordinary measures that her predecessor, Mario Draghi, rolled out.

Some analysts immediately compared her performance unfavorably with that of Mr. Draghi, whose promise to do ""whatever it takes"" to preserve the euro helped end the region's debt crisis during his tenure.

The ECB said it would roll out cheap loans for banks, at an interest rate as low as minus 0.75%, and step up bond purchases under its 2.6 trillion euros ($2.9 trillion) bond-buying program.

But the bank left its key interest rate unchanged at minus 0.5%. Investors had widely expected the ECB to cut rates by at least 0.1 percentage point, after major central banks including the Federal Reserve and Bank of England announced aggressive rate cuts in recent days.

""The overall scale of the package, given that the economy is likely heading for recession, is modest,"" said Nick Kounis, an analyst with Dutch bank ABN Amro.

Instead, Ms. Lagarde called repeatedly on the region's governments to take on more of the burden of supporting growth. Crucially, she indicated that the ECB wouldn't step in to support Southern European governments if they came under pressure from investors.

""We are not here to close spreads. There are other tools and other actors to deal with these issues,"" Ms. Lagarde said.

European stock indexes fell, the euro tumbled against the dollar and yields of Italian 10-year government bonds jumped to the highest level in months.

""How can she say such a thing? The ECB should never say this,"" tweeted Guntram Wolff, a German economist who is the director of Brussels think tank Bruegel. ""We have just massively increased the risks of a euro-area crisis resulting from the Covid19 shock. OMG.""

In a subsequent TV interview, Ms. Lagarde sought to redirect her remarks, saying that the ECB would seek to avoid the fragmentation of the eurozone and that its tools were available to Italy.

But the mixed messages underscored to investors the limitations of an ECB steered by Ms. Lagarde, an attorney and former French finance minister who is the only ECB president without prior central-bank experience. Investors grew to count on wave after wave of monetary stimulus from Frankfurt during Mr. Draghi's eight-year term, which ended in October.

""The bigger concern is that it shows how unfamiliar she still is with language, which especially in such stressful times is not helpful,"" said Oliver Rakau, an economist with Oxford Economics.

The ECB is seeking to support a eurozone economy that is likely headed for recession, dragged down by business bottlenecks, softening consumer demand and the lockdown of the region's third-biggest economy, Italy.

The eurozone economy could shrink 1.2% in 2020, according to research firm Capital Economics.

Thursday's decision comes amid a deep split in the ECB, which Ms. Lagarde could struggle to bridge.

Many ECB officials are worried about the adverse side effects of a long period of easy money and the pressure negative rates place on banks.

World News: Decision On Pell's Appeal Is Delayed

CANBERRA, Australia -- Australia's highest court withheld its decision on an appeal by former Vatican finance chief Cardinal George Pell of his conviction for child sex abuse, prolonging a legal battle that has bitterly divided Australian society and Catholics around the world.

Cardinal Pell is the highest-ranking Catholic official to be convicted of child-sex crimes. The 78-year-old prelate is serving a six-year prison sentence after a jury found him guilty of assaulting two 13-year-old choirboys in a Melbourne cathedral while he was archbishop in the 1990s.

This week's appeal was potentially the last bid to clear his name. During two days of hearings, the High Court heard arguments from Cardinal Pell's lawyers as to why the appeal should be allowed, and arguments from the prosecution for upholding his conviction.

The judges decided Thursday to reserve their decision, meaning they won't offer a verdict yet. Reserving judgment gives the judges more time to consider the arguments and make written statements outlining their reasons.

They could acquit the cardinal or uphold his conviction, or they could send the case to be reheard at the Victoria Court of Appeals. It may be days or months before the High Court releases its decision. If the judges believe an innocent person is behind bars, they could make an order soon, paving the way for his release, and publish the reasons later, experts said.

Outside the court in Canberra, Cardinal Pell's supporters sang hymns and waved Australian flags and signs saying ""Keep the Faith"" and ""May the Australian legal system be inspired by the Holy Spirit."" An advocate for abuse victims held up a sign saying: ""Burn in Hell Pell.""

The cardinal was convicted by a unanimous verdict in December 2018 after a jury in an earlier trial was deadlocked. In August 2019, a panel of appellate judges in Victoria state ruled 2-1 to uphold his conviction.

The prosecution case relied on the evidence of one of the former choirboys, now in his 30s with a young family. He reported the abuses to the police in 2015, after his friend died from an accidental drug overdose. The other choirboy never publicly made accusations against Cardinal Pell.

The Holy See has reserved judgment until the appeal process is exhausted, even as it continues to be roiled by allegations of clerical sex abuse around the world.

World News: U.S. Strikes Iran-Backed Militia in Iraq

The U.S. conducted a series of airstrikes against an Iran-backed militia group in Iraq, U.S. officials said Thursday, entering into a new phase of a military confrontation with Iran and its allies by retaliating for the deaths earlier this week of two Americans and a British service member.

The U.S. strikes targeted five weapons-storage facilities in Iraq associated with Kataib Hezbollah, a Shiite militia group that U.S. officials said has frequently targeted Iraqi bases where American service members are based.

The strikes aimed to degrade the group's ability to conduct future attacks against U.S. and coalition forces, the Pentagon said in a statement. It gave no estimate of casualties among members of the militia, but officials estimated there were as many as three to four dozen casualties.

The U.S. had been consulting with the British government on the operation, but the retaliatory strikes were conducted by U.S. forces alone, U.S. officials said.

The strikes were ""defensive and proportional,"" the Pentagon said, and were in response to the threats posed by Iranian-backed militias operating in Iraq. The U.S. has about 5,000 troops based in Iraq.

""The United States will not tolerate attacks against our people, our interests, or our allies,"" Defense Secretary Mark Esper said. ""As we have demonstrated in recent months, we will take any action necessary to protect our forces in Iraq and the region.""

A TV channel linked to the Kataib Hezbollah militia said four paramilitary fighters had been wounded and two federal policemen killed, along with a civilian who was hit in a strike on an airport under construction. The toll couldn't immediately be independently verified and the Iraqi government did not comment on the attack. Iranian officials did not respond to a request for comment.

The U.S. strikes came after a series of attacks in recent weeks against bases in Iraq where American military personnel are stationed. Before Wednesday, those strikes had not been considered successful by U.S. officials. Wednesday's strike at Camp Taji, north of Baghdad, killed the two Americans and the British service member, and wounded more than a dozen others, spurring the U.S. to act.

U.S. commanders consulted with the White House Thursday before conducting the strikes early on Friday morning in Iraq, officials said.

Before the U.S. strikes, military officials did not identify which group they believed had carried out the attack on Camp Taji, and no group had claimed responsibility. Two Iran-backed militias praised the attack. Kataib Hezbollah, which the U.S. has blamed for previous rocket attacks, congratulated the perpetrators and urged other militias to follow their example. The group said the U.S. must face the consequences of staying in Iraq after the country's parliament passed a nonbinding resolution in favor of their expulsion earlier this year.

The rocket attack on Wednesday drew fresh attention to the hostile environment for U.S. forces in Iraq, where they have repeatedly come under fire in recent months. It also put Iraq back in the crosshairs of a potential flare-up in the simmering conflict between Washington and Tehran. Iraq has proved unable or unwilling to meet U.S. and allied demands in the past to rein in activities of militias.

Tensions had recently eased since flaring in January after the U.S. killed a top Iranian commander, Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, in an airstrike after he arrived at Baghdad airport.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: As China Recovers, It Scrutinizes Foreigners

BEIJING -- As China grows more optimistic about containing the spread of coronavirus within the country, it is confronting a potential threat to its recovery: the rest of the world.

Epidemic-control efforts have turned to foreigners in China in recent days as confirmed cases within the country have slowed. Police officers and local government workers have made house calls specifically to check whether expatriates recently traveled to another country where they could have contracted the virus.

The shift in focus comes as China attempts to recast the coronavirus as a global issue and touts its own handling of the epidemic. The government's draconian but seemingly effective lockdowns of cities have helped reduce person-to-person contact and slow the spread of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.

Meanwhile, the World Health Organization on Wednesday declared the new coronavirus a pandemic. Confirmed cases are rising in other parts of Asia, the U.S. and Europe, and more than 4,500 people have died globally, with the majority of them in China. All of Italy was placed under quarantine on Tuesday; the virus's death toll there rose above 1,000 on Thursday, and the number of infected patients topped 15,000.

Within China, imported cases outnumbered domestic cases outside Hubei province for six consecutive days as of Wednesday, the National Health Commission said. In one week, total imported cases rose to 85 from 20 on Wednesday. Beijing authorities said Wednesday that one imported case had come from the U.S.

""The number of these imported cases is likely to increase,"" said Hitoshi Oshitani, a professor of virology at Japan's Tohoku University School of Medicine. ""That may trigger another large outbreak in China.""

The emphasis on limiting international exposures has bolstered the perception that China has efficiently and effectively addressed the outbreak -- a narrative the government has promoted, despite initially playing down the virus's spread for weeks before taking decisive action.

Beijing criticized some countries, notably the U.S., for raising travel alerts against China and for chartering flights to evacuate their citizens. As the virus has spread more quickly outside China than inside, the Chinese government itself has evacuated its overseas citizens, including 200 Chinese nationals from Iran, where 8,000 people have been infected.

On Monday, Beijing authorities asked foreigners in particular to minimize unnecessary travel and to wear masks outside, saying the pressure has mounted to control imported cases of infection as the epidemic worsens globally. The week before, they had said anyone arriving from South Korea, Italy, Iran or Japan -- countries battling recent surges in infections -- would have to quarantine for 14 days.

And on Wednesday, Beijing officials ordered anyone entering China -- even from countries with nonserious virus conditions -- to confine themselves at home for 14 days, effective immediately. Short-term travelers entering China will be required to stay in designated hotels and to submit to nucleic acid testing, and are forbidden from leaving the hotel until test results are obtained.

On the ground, foreigners have sometimes been singled out. In a Beijing neighborhood near the Forbidden City, local government workers delivered a message to two Americans living in adjacent bungalows last week, translated into English and shown to them on a cellphone: ""Don't have too much contact with foreign friends to avoid spreading the disease."" The workers didn't contact their Chinese neighbors.

In Shanghai, Jared T. Nelson, who runs a compliance startup, said he has received visits from local police at home and his office inquiring about any recent travel abroad.

On Saturday, two policemen knocked on Mr. Nelson's apartment door to ask when he returned to the city. When he told them about his January trip to Hangzhou, a coastal city 100 miles southwest of Shanghai, they said it didn't count. They asked about trips outside China, and explained that they were checking foreigners in the area who might need to undergo quarantine. They left after inspecting the passport of Mr. Nelson, who hasn't been abroad since 2018.

""There's a perception that everything is under control here, but out of control abroad,"" the 36-year-old Wyoming native said. ""All of us who are obviously foreign -- we're potentially carriers.""

Virus Batters Economy --- Dow posts worst day since 1987 as outbreak's impact deepens

The U.S. and world economies look increasingly likely to slip into recession as swaths of commerce shut down and the Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its worst day since 1987 amid the coronavirus pandemic.

The global financial rout deepened Thursday despite new measures by major central banks to ease market strains and bolster the economy. The Trump administration and Congress, meanwhile, were close to agreement on legislation to provide federal financial assistance to many affected businesses and workers, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said.

The Dow industrials fell nearly 10%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq joined it in bear-market territory. For the day, the Dow industrials shed 2352.6 points to 21200.62. The S&P 500 sank 260.74 points, or 9.5%, to 2480.64. And the Nasdaq Composite slid 750.25 points, or 9.4% to 7201.80. (By comparison, the Dow fell 22.6% during the Black Monday crash, on Oct. 19, 1987.)

The selloff extended to U.S. futures Thursday night and Asian stocks on Friday morning. S&P and Dow futures were each down more than 2%. In early trading, Japan's Nikkei 225 Stock Average was down 9.3%, while South Korea's Kospi was down 7.5%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 6.3% and the Shanghai Composite was down 3.4%.

In the U.S. Thursday, airline and cruise company shares led the collapse. United Airlines Holdings was down 25%, Delta Air Lines dropped 21%, and Spirit Airlines dropped 33%. Royal Caribbean Cruises plummeted 32%.

European stocks suffered one of their worst days in decades, with the Stoxx Europe 600 index dropping 11.5% by day's end. This came after the European Central Bank said it would issue cheap loans to banks and buy more eurozone debt to mitigate the economic shock of the coronavirus -- but didn't cut its key interest rate, which is already below zero.

U.S. stocks initially pared their losses, but later resumed their fall after the U.S. Federal Reserve said it would inject more than $1.5 trillion into short-term funding markets on Thursday and Friday to prevent ominous trading conditions from creating a sharper economic contraction.

Across the U.S. -- the world's largest economy -- authorities this week have canceled or postponed a swelling number of commercial flights, industry conferences, music festivals, sports events and other public activities, while oil producers are being slammed by a drop in crude prices. All this increases the chances that the record-long economic expansion will end in coming months, economists said.

""We are going into a global recession. The necessary measures to contain the spread of the virus make that unavoidable,"" wrote Vitor Constancio, a former vice president of the European Central Bank, on Twitter Thursday.

In the U.S. alone, ""the chances of a recession are going way up,"" said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase.

President Trump's announcement Wednesday night of a 30-day ban on some travel to the U.S. from Europe to contain the spread of the virus came as global air traffic was already falling.

While cancellations and postponements of public activities in the U.S. -- such as professional and college baseball, hockey and basketball games, Broadway shows and Austin's South by Southwest festival -- may help slow the spread of the virus, it will inevitably take a toll on consumer spending, economists said.

""It's going to be massively disruptive to the economy,"" said Joshua Shapiro of consulting firm MFR Inc.

""You go to a sporting event, not only do you buy a ticket. You buy some beers, maybe you go to dinner first. You go out afterwards. You're spending money,"" Mr. Shapiro said. ""It's not just the ticket to the event, it's the plane ticket, it's the hotel. It's all these people working at these places.""

As U.S. benchmark crude crashed to near $30 a barrel this week, shale firms announced a string of drilling and spending cuts that will squeeze hundreds of energy service companies that employ the bulk of the industry's workforce.

Apache Corp. said it would drop all of its rigs in the Permian basin of Texas and New Mexico, shift resources overseas and slash its quarterly dividend by 90%.

Matador Resources Co. plans to cut half of its drilling rigs by the end of June, while executives and board members take pay cuts.

Marathon Oil Corp. plans to slash at least $500 million in spending, halt all drilling and fracking in Oklahoma and reduce activity in the Permian, where it has four rigs and one fracking crew.

If enough producers throttle down all at once, and drilling rigs are idled for an extended period, energy-service firms will have to cut workers and prices, and over time, growing U.S. oil production would flatten and decline.

JPMorgan Chase said Thursday it now thinks the economy will fall into recession in the first half of this year, ending the expansion that began in 2009. It expects output to fall by an annual rate of 2% in the first quarter and by another 3% in the second quarter. The bank expects the economy to return to solid growth in the second half, assuming a ""fiscal response"" of $500 billion from Congress.

The Institute of International Finance predicts the global economy will grow about 1% this year, the smallest gain since the global financial crisis in 2009 and a level that would likely mean many countries would fall into recession.

A recession can take months to show up in economic data.

Most likely, it would first become visible in sentiment readings, new claims for unemployment insurance benefits, and eventually in spending and investment data.

Through last week, U.S. employers generally appeared to resist the urge to lay off workers. New jobless claims fell last week, to a historically low level of 211,000, the Labor Department said Thursday.

But IHS Markit said last week that business activity in the U.S. service sector -- representing industries from restaurants to health-care providers -- fell in February for the first time since 2013.

ECB President Christine Lagarde on Thursday echoed other central bankers who have recently said there are limits to how much monetary policy can do in the current crisis and called on other policy makers to use fiscal policy, such as tax and government spending measures, to provide support.

""An ambitious and coordinated fiscal stance is now needed in view of the weakened outlook and to safeguard against the further materialization of downside risks,"" she said.

REVIEW --- Inside a No-Go Zone For Terror --- Mauritania has closed off a wide swath of the Sahara to block the path of Islamist militants.

Mauritania, a vast Muslim country on the edge of West Africa, has adopted a unique strategy to protect itself against an Islamist militant threat that is getting bigger and closer: It has turned more than a quarter of its territory into a no-go zone.

In 2018, Mauritania handed its military control over 108,000 square miles of the Sahara, an area roughly the size of Nevada. Late last month, the Mauritanian army gave The Wall Street Journal unprecedented access to the exclusion zone. Inside, troops have great latitude to arrest or kill anyone suspected of smuggling arms, trafficking drugs or importing Islamist violence. ""If you're in the military zone and you don't have permission, you're a suspected terrorist,"" said army Maj. Sidi Mohamed Hedeid.

It was a move born of a fear that bad things are coming Mauritania's way. The country straddles the Sahara, and in the south, the Sahel, a belt of semiarid land that stretches just below the great desert. A wave of Islamist militancy is overwhelming the countries of the Sahel. Affiliates of al Qaeda and Islamic State killed more than 4,000 people in Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali last year in some 800 attacks.

Deep inside Mauritania's exclusion zone is a military outpost called Lemgheity, or ""covered well."" The name comes from a water source that travelers braving the Sahara could find there. No village or trading post is nearby. The military stations its troops here because it's a crossroads for nefarious actors coming from Western Sahara, Algeria and Mali.

Just over the Mali border, hundreds of square miles of desert are controlled by fighters from Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin, or JNIM, an umbrella group formed by three al Qaeda allies. Along ancient caravan routes, the lines blur among militants, arms traffickers, camel herders and drug mules. At two wells long used by travelers and herders, al Qaeda fighters now meet and control who gets to drink, the Mauritanians say.

""As long as our neighbors aren't in charge of their territory, we have to take extra steps to protect ours,"" said Col. Siyed El Asry, deputy commander of the military zone, after inspecting his troops at Lemgheity.

From Mali, a rocky spine called El Hank, or ""jaw,"" extends more than 250 miles southwest across Mauritania; its boulders of dark gray shale have survived 500 million years of erosion around the escarpment. Before GPS navigation, travelers used El Hank as their guidepost through the emptiness of the desert.

The Mauritanian army splits Lemgheity's forces between two adjacent positions atop El Hank. Stone guard towers offer clear fields of fire at likely approaches from Algeria, Mali and Western Sahara. Two lines of rocks mark an airstrip on the otherwise featureless desert floor below, where searing heat distorts the air and creates a mirage of shimmering pools of water. A Mauritania flag, green and red with a yellow star-and-crescent, flutters in front of a tiny stone-and-mud mosque.

In 2005, the outpost was the scene of the bloodiest militant attack in Mauritania in recent years. Some 150 fighters poured over the border from Mali, and at dawn on a June day, seized the high ground on El Hank. The militants surprised Lemgheity's poorly trained, poorly armed 50-man garrison. Seventeen soldiers were killed and were buried in a mass grave downhill from the outpost they died failing to defend. Today, soldiers pray there, holding their hands palms-upward in the traditional display of faith.

With each subsequent attack after 2005, militants ventured further out of the desert and toward towns and cities. Three troops died in a 2007 attack. The following year, militants captured and decapitated 12 soldiers. In 2011, militants believed to be from al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb crossed into Mauritania's south and kidnapped a gendarme.

But the 2011 attack was the last that Mauritania has suffered. In 2009, the military formed an elite Special Intervention Group, which has since received advanced infantry and logistical training from U.S. Marines. The commandos now man seven outposts in the exclusion zone; the military won't disclose the size of the force there. Mobile units spend up to two weeks at a time roaming the hinterlands in desert-tan Toyota Land Cruiser pickup trucks hunting for infiltrators.

It's not a free-fire zone. The army must have reasons to suspect that the pickup trucks they spot crossing the desert are carrying terrorists or smugglers. But officers have wide discretion to arrest or kill suspects without military-zone travel permits. ""We scrutinize targets very closely,"" said Col. Ahmed Salem Noueh, the army's chief of planning. ""Sometimes the enemy comes as a trader. Sometimes he comes as a herder.""

Commandos also dig wells and provide medicine for desert dwellers along the Mali border, according to the Mauritanians. ""The terrorists would like to win the hearts of the population,"" said Maj. Hedeid. ""We want to beat them to it."" Mauritanian officials say that they hold jailhouse counseling sessions with captured militants, in which Islamic scholars try to persuade prisoners that violence is against their religion.

In addition to training commandos, the U.S. has donated two Cessna surveillance aircraft that can transmit live footage of enemy positions. Washington applauds Mauritania's anti-militant zeal, while also criticizing the country's human-rights record. The State Department has suspended some military aid because of Mauritania's failure to crack down on human trafficking and hereditary slavery.

In the capital, Nouakchott, rumors persist that the government secretly forged a nonaggression pact with the militants that explains the lack of successful recent attacks, an allegation that the army hotly denies. ""There is no agreement with al Qaeda,"" said Maj. Hedeid. ""They're our enemy. We're killing them.""

The military believes the no-go zone is the source of its success. In the first two months of this year, troops twice stopped suspects in the desert. In mid-February, one of Mauritania's Western allies intercepted signals and tipped off the Mauritanian army that two suspicious pickups had entered from Western Sahara and were heading east through the zone. Another truck that crossed into Mauritania from Mali was headed west to meet them.

A Mauritanian Super Tucano ground-attack fighter plane, bought from Brazil, scrambled from an air base on the edge of the desert. ""We watched them second by second,"" said Col. Noueh. At the rendezvous point, military photos show, the Super Tucano strafed one of the trucks, which then exploded into orange flame, releasing a rooster's tail of oily black smoke that rose like a beacon into the open sky. Ground troops swarmed the charred remains, seized the other trucks and a pile of machine guns and rifles, and arrested six suspects, several in military-style camouflage pants and one with a leg wound.

The soldiers treated the injured man, tied blindfolds around the prisoners' heads and lined them up next to the contraband for photos. (The army has yet to release information about their nationalities or intentions.)

On the last day of February, with the Saharan sun at its hottest, the troops at the Lemgheity outpost retreated to a stone building, plopped down on cushions on a deep-red floral rug and tore into a shared plate of stewed mutton and soft white bread. They slurped shot glasses of sugary tea.

On a television hooked up to a satellite dish, the men watched as Taliban and U.S. negotiators signed an accord intended to end the 18-year conflict in Afghanistan, which began with al Qaeda's hijacking of four American jetliners on 9/11. It was a surreal moment in the ever-shifting war against Islamist extremists, combatants on one front watching those on another make peace. ""I'd like the same thing here in the Sahel,"" said Maj. Hedeid.

Sanders, Despite Losses, Sticks to Economic Vision --- Candidate knows he's losing the Democratic nomination but aims to push party to left

Bernie Sanders concedes he is losing the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination. But the Vermont senator is still fighting a bigger war: his lifelong crusade to push the party's economic agenda to the left.

The candidate wants to dramatically expand government in order to address ""the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality in this country,"" as he put it Wednesday.

Mr. Sanders's uncompromising adherence to his liberal ideals has been both his strength and weakness in this campaign. It energizes his core supporters, who favor his purity over more flexible rivals. But it has also turned off Democrats who dislike his ideas or worry they are unrealistic, and that his stubbornness would keep him from the give-and-take necessary to accomplish change in Washington. As Mr. Sanders himself has acknowledged, many also worry that his far-left position could make it hard to draw enough voters to beat President Trump in a general election. The escalating coronavirus crisis might also make Americans more risk-averse in choosing a leader.

Mr. Sanders argues that voters agree with his platform, even if they are skeptical of his candidacy. ""Poll after poll . . . shows that a strong majority of the American people support our progressive agenda,"" he said, in explaining why he would continue his campaign against front-runner Joe Biden, despite two straight weeks of primary losses and calls for him to drop out and unify the party against Mr. Trump.

He vowed to use Sunday's debate, the first solely between the two candidates, to press his rival for detailed plans for expanding health care, reducing childhood poverty and curbing the political power of billionaires. The candidates face primaries on Tuesday in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio.

Mr. Sanders's bid to remake Democratic economic thinking remains one of the most intense conflicts in this election cycle, pitting him against affluent party donors and policy makers who share many of his general goals, but prefer a less government-oriented, or more tempered approach.

Surveys indicate a party electorate torn. A February Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed 53% of Democratic voters preferred a candidate pushing Sanders-like ""larger scale policies that might cost more"" and ""bring major change,"" versus 41% favoring a Biden-like candidate ""who proposes smaller scale policies that . . . will bring less change.""

But the same poll found Democrats, by 53% to 42%, favored a candidate ""with the best chance to defeat Donald Trump"" over one ""closest to your views"" -- and they have increasingly concluded Mr. Biden has the best chance.

When Mr. Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, appeared ascendant last month in the nominating contest, his sweeping platform of national health care, universal free college and a Green New Deal drew blistering criticism from Democratic stalwarts.

Harvard economist Lawrence Summers, a top adviser to both Presidents Clinton and Obama, predicted ""major adverse consequences"" for workers, markets and business investment should Mr. Sanders prevail. Former Obama White House chief economist Jason Furman, also now at Harvard, said the Sanders program would lead to ""too many individuals too constrained from choices"" and ""a weaker economy."" The Progressive Policy Institute, a Washington center-left think tank, branded the platform ""fiscal fantasy.""

None of that moved Mr. Sanders to soften his policies. Instead, Mr. Sanders and his aides have blasted the criticism and the critics as tainted and out of touch. They blame moderate Democratic economists and think tanks, as much as Republicans, for long-term wage stagnation and other economic worries still haunting millions of Americans.

""We need to think outside the box,"" said Warren Gunnels, Mr. Sanders's policy adviser. ""Over the past 45 years we've seen a massive increase in income and wealth inequality while the working class continues to struggle. It's too late for establishment economics.""

Mr. Sanders is more likely to discuss fostering a ""moral economy"" than strategies to boost gross domestic product, business investment or corporate profits. With his ""economic bill of rights,"" he wants Washington to guarantee all Americans a job, health insurance, college and housing.

Many Democratic economists ""would argue those are fine aspirations, but in order to achieve them, you'd have to intervene in markets beyond levels they're comfortable with,"" said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the chief economist in the Obama administration for then-Vice President Biden.

Mr. Sanders proposes sharply higher taxes, government spending and regulation. He would boost the size of the federal government's share of GDP to a level exceeded only during World War II.

While many Democrats over the past few decades have tried to balance government intervention with market forces, Mr. Sanders has less trust in markets to improve lives. On Thursday, he said his big-government vision of a national health-care plan and price controls on drug companies would put the country on stronger footing to address crises such as the coronavirus pandemic.

At times, he has dismissed cost concerns outright. Asked at a Feb. 18 CNN Las Vegas town hall about the price and feasibility of his plan to phase out fossil fuels, he replied: ""You tell me how much is too much if we're talking about saving this planet.""

Mr. Sanders wants to smash the conventional wisdom that he says has constrained thinking in Washington since Ronald Reagan -- a consensus that treats higher taxes and new government programs with suspicion -- and reopen discussion of liberal ideas that haven't been seriously considered since the 1970s.

The candidate already claims victory on that front, recounting how proposals from his failed 2016 bid, dismissed at the time as too far left, have since been embraced by Democratic party leaders.

One fight with Hillary Clinton, who won the 2016 Democratic nomination, was over his push to double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. The Democratic-led House last year passed a bill seeking to make that law, while all his 2020 rival candidates endorsed the goal. Mr. Sanders's 2016 proposal for a Wall Street tax on certain financial transactions was also embraced by much of the 2020 field. Mr. Biden's current positions on many issues, such as expanding Social Security and Medicare, have moved him closer to Mr. Sanders than the longtime Delaware politician has been for much of his career.

""I have been called radical and extreme,"" Mr. Sanders said in Iowa last year. ""Over the last four years . . . a whole lot of other people have become radical and extreme.""

Some mainstream center-left economists praise Mr. Sanders's bid to shake up the Washington consensus on restricting spending. ""All upper-income democracies in the world have much more generous welfare states than the U.S. and do fine,"" said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank that has long advised both Republican and Democratic administrations. ""We've gone so far off the rails in terms of underinvestment in the public sphere that even a massive shift would only get us part way to where we should be.""

The Sanders campaign has been the only major one in this election cycle to avoid even talking to top advisers of previous Democratic presidents. Economists who weren't part of the Clinton or Obama administrations have been close to the Sanders campaign. One is Stephanie Kelton, a professor at Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, N.Y., who served as an aide to Mr. Sanders on the Senate Budget Committee. She is the leading proponent of ""modern monetary theory,"" which argues that governments shouldn't fret over debt and deficits.

Another is Darrick Hamilton of Ohio State University, whose work focuses on what he calls ""economic justice."" He aims to narrow the wealth gap between black and white households and has been a proponent of the federal job guarantee idea that Mr. Sanders has endorsed.

Mr. Sanders's wealth tax was written with the help of two French economists at the University of California, Berkeley, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman.

The Progressive Policy Institute estimates that Mr. Sanders is proposing adding just over $50 trillion in spending over 10 years, nearly doubling the federal government's current outlays. The new funds would mainly be used to expand the social safety net and infrastructure spending.

That is more than eight times the spending proposed by Mr. Biden, according to PPI.

Mr. Sanders would boost taxes by more than $20 trillion over 10 years, according to PPI, by increases in income, payroll and corporate taxes, as well as the new wealth tax.

That is six times the hikes laid out by Mr. Biden.

Most mainstream economists say spending and taxes on that scale would so distort the economy and private-sector activity that it would undermine growth. They warn that significantly higher tax rates could damp incentives for businesses and individuals to invest, while bigger payouts to households could curb incentives to work. They add that attempts by regulators to override market outcomes can impose costly inefficiencies in affected industries.

Mr. Gunnels, the Sanders aide, dismissed concerns about boosting the size of government. ""If we were a poor country . . . these would be legitimate questions,"" he said. ""We're not living in a Third World country. It's not too much to ask that everybody in this country has a decent standard of living.""

Sanders allies said his platform has successful parallels: Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1930s New Deal, which created Social Security and a raft of new government programs and regulations; and Lyndon B. Johnson's 1960s Great Society, which created Medicare and new antipoverty initiatives.

Harvard's Mr. Summers said the scale of Mr. Sanders's proposals would far exceed anything FDR or LBJ enacted, or even what South Dakota Democratic Sen. George McGovern proposed during his 1972 landslide loss to Richard Nixon, a defeat that helped usher in the party's retreat from liberalism.

If Mr. Sanders enacted his full program, government as a share of GDP would jump from the 2017 level of about 38%, one of the lowest levels in the developed world, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, to more than 50%. That is well above any peacetime level in U.S. history, but in line with European countries such as France and Denmark.

He also envisions a raft of new government regulations, from national rent control to new rules for CEO pay to an outright ban on fracking.

While some Democratic economists prefer to address climate change with market incentives, such as a carbon tax, Mr. Sanders would rely more on direct government orders. To protect energy workers who might lose their jobs, he promises five years of government-guaranteed salary, plus housing assistance, pension support and retirement subsidies for those who decide not to continue working.

That ""would be an utter nightmare to enforce,"" said Dean Baker, an economist at the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, saying it would be difficult to flesh out the criteria for who exactly would qualify.

Mr. Sanders would aim to shrink the role of the financial sector in the economy by, among other things, breaking up the largest banks, and reimposing Depression-era limits on banking activity.

He would make it harder for employers to fire workers, unionized or not, and would require big companies to give workers shares of company stock and the right to choose nearly half the seats on corporate boards. His goal is to recalibrate the balance of power between corporations and unions, who have seen their clout erode steadily over the past 40 years.

""In Bernie Sanders's world, the market doesn't come from a state of nature, it comes out of an allocation of power,"" said Robert Reich, a Berkeley public policy professor, who served as President Clinton's labor secretary and has periodically defended Mr. Sanders against attacks from other academics. ""The standard economic view is that the market is filled with potential win-win opportunities, but when you're talking about power, it's more complicated. Some people gain it and others lose it.""

Politics: Court to Reconsider Subpoena Decision

WASHINGTON -- A federal appeals court announced it will reconsider whether former White House counsel Don McGahn must testify in a congressional investigation of President Trump, withdrawing a February ruling that declined to enforce a subpoena issued by a House committee.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said it would hear the case again, this time with more judges participating. Oral arguments will take place April 28.

The court issued an order saying it was vacating a Feb. 28 ruling by a divided three-judge panel that said courts shouldn't get in the middle of disputes between branches of government like the McGahn subpoena battle between Congress and the White House.

The Democratic-led House Judiciary Committee issued the subpoena last year as it was investigating possible misconduct by Mr. Trump, including whether he obstructed special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing. The White House instructed Mr. McGahn not to appear.

A central question in the case is whether the House has legal standing to ask a court to force White House compliance. The White House separately has argued that close presidential advisers, like Mr. McGahn, enjoy absolute immunity from appearing before Congress. The court's February ruling never addressed that issue because it said the case didn't belong in court.

That ruling said Congress had other tools to use against the Trump administration, such as holding officials in contempt.

The Judiciary Committee asked the D.C. Circuit to reconsider the case, which prompted Friday's court order.

U.S. News: FAA Probes In-Flight Crack on Southwest Jet

U.S. air-safety officials are investigating potential structural problems affecting hundreds of Boeing 737 jets following an in-flight incident that left a 12-inch rupture in the aluminum skin of a Southwest Airlines plane.

Nobody was hurt on Monday night's flight, en route from Las Vegas to Boise, Idaho, as the damaged aircraft descended to a safe altitude and the pilots landed at their destination, according to the carrier and the Federal Aviation Administration. The plane's cabin gradually lost pressure but it stabilized after pilots descended to a lower altitude, and oxygen masks never deployed.

The unusual event has prompted the agency to analyze whether more-frequent inspections should be ordered to check the integrity of the same part of the fuselage on similar 737 models.

The FAA analysis doesn't affect Boeing's 737 MAX models, which are newer and currently grounded around the globe.

Pilots on Southwest Flight 1685 descended to 22,000 feet from 39,000 feet and continued safely to their destination.

""The aircraft was able to maintain a safe cabin pressure,"" according to an FAA statement, adding that the agency is investigating.

A spokeswoman for Southwest said the plane was taken out of service and is being repaired. ""We consistently review our maintenance programs based on new information and continually seek opportunities to improve our robust safety practices,"" she said.

Southwest has told the FAA that previously mandated maintenance checks found external cracks on two other 737s in the same location as with the plane involved in Monday's incident, according to people familiar with the details. But those cracks -- on top of the plane behind the cockpit -- didn't result in the kind of cabin decompression that occurred on the flight this week, according to information the carrier has provided to FAA inspectors.

Current FAA safety rules require inspections after every 1,500 flights to look for cracks on the exterior of that portion of the fuselage. The jet that landed safely in Boise was inspected roughly 500 flights before Monday's incident, according to a person familiar with the details.

Such maintenance checks for structural problems are routine safety initiatives across all airliner models.

The most serious result of cracks in an aircraft's body is a rapid decompression of the cabin. Such a problem can create a hole in the fuselage, through which, in extreme cases, passengers can even be sucked out in flight.

The FAA and Boeing have been devising enhanced maintenance procedures for the same section of what is called the crown of 737 jets since 2008. The original safety directive was replaced by revised inspection requirements in 2016 and again in 2017.

It is too early to know whether the FAA will require more-frequent inspections, according to another person familiar with the details. Before any decision, FAA experts are expected to review the service and maintenance history -- as well as the structural integrity of certain modifications -- affecting Southwest and other U.S. operators of the widely used 737 models.

In 2016, the FAA's maintenance order called on airlines to look for missing or loose fasteners and laid out other measures intended to prevent cracks from spreading.

The 2017 safety directive said Boeing determined that the skin of certain 737 models is subject to widespread metal-fatigue damage. If the weakness isn't detected and corrected, according to the FAA, it could ""result in reduced structural integrity of the airplane.""

REVIEW --- When Epidemics Wreaked Havoc In America --- Deadly infectious diseases were once common in the U.S., until science conquered them. In today's crisis, it's worth recalling those celebrated victories.

It may have been the high point of America's fragile love affair with medical science. ""SALK'S VACCINE WORKS,"" screamed the nation's headlines on April 12, 1955. ""POLIO IS CONQUERED."" An insidious childhood disease that came like clockwork each summer during the middle years of the 20th century, killing thousands and crippling many more, would be all but eradicated in the U.S. within a single generation.

Rarely, if ever, had a scientist received the instant adulation that awaited Jonas Salk. Tributes piled up, including the Congressional Gold Medal, awarded previously to the likes of Thomas Edison, Charles Lindbergh and General George C. Marshall. The Eisenhower White House circulated a memo suggesting a Rose Garden ceremony for maximum political gain: ""We've [got to] show that the president is just as interested as [Franklin D. Roosevelt] in polio . . . to take away the perennial Democratic thunder."" Yet those who witnessed the event were touched by its simple humanity. ""No bands played and no flags waved,"" wrote a reporter who had followed Eisenhower for years. ""But nothing could have been more impressive than this grandfather standing there and telling Dr. Salk in a voice trembling with emotion, 'I have no words to thank you. I am very, very happy.'""

New vaccines soon followed -- for measles, mumps and rubella. Coupled with earlier laboratory miracles, including the introduction of antibiotics like penicillin and streptomycin, Americans saw a huge jump in their life expectancy, driven by the precipitous decline of infectious diseases. The war against germs, it appeared, had become a rout.

The impact of disease on American history is a remarkably understudied subject. Textbooks give it short shrift in comparison to political, military, diplomatic and economic affairs, but the catalog of key episodes is long. We must not forget that the European conquest and settlement of the Americas were largely dependent on the deadly diseases the settlers brought; or that the grand plan of the Continental Congress to conquer Quebec in 1775 was halted, in large part, by a fearful smallpox outbreak among the troops; or that more American soldiers died from influenza during World War I than from battle wounds, in a pandemic that killed upward of 50 million people world-wide.

It takes the fear of a pandemic, as we are experiencing today with Covid-19, to remind us that infectious diseases were once so common, so deadly, that Americans had little choice but to accept the toll they exacted with stoicism and dread. Death by epidemic remained a natural, if depressing, part of American life until just a few generations ago.

Take yellow fever, for example. A virus transmitted by the bite of the female Aedes aegypti mosquito, with a mortality rate sometimes approaching 50%, it came to the Americas on slave ships from Africa. As trade routes expanded, it reached the port cities of North America, striking Philadelphia, the young nation's capital, in 1793, where it killed at least 10% of the population and caused the federal government to temporarily disband. Most of Congress fled the city, as did President George Washington and Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, an ardent defender of rural values, who found odd comfort amid the carnage. ""The yellow fever will discourage the growth of cities in our nation,"" he wrote a friend, ""& I view great cities as pestilential to the morals, the health and the liberties of man.""

Americans were stumped by its spread. The fact that a vector as tiny as a mosquito could cause a catastrophe of this magnitude was simply beyond anyone's comprehension. Physicians blamed the disease on miasmas -- the noxious vapors arising from corpses, rotting food, and swamp and sewer gases -- that were believed to form dangerous airborne clouds. The diaries these doctors left behind show how completely they missed the signals that now seem so obvious today. All complained about mosquitoes swarming and biting, relentless and inescapable. One remarked that he'd never seen as many people ""covered with blisters from their venomous operations."" Yet it would be another full century before Dr. Walter Reed confirmed the transmission of the disease by mosquito, which led, in turn, to the draining of swamps, the screening of windows, the development of insecticides and eventually a vaccine.

New York City also saw its share of epidemics. Hardly a decade went by in the 1700s without a serious smallpox eruption. One outbreak in 1731 killed more than 500 of the city's 10,000 residents, roughly three times the percentage of New Yorkers who would die in the influenza pandemic of 1918.

As the city grew, quickly becoming America's largest, observers described a pulsing new energy -- ""a sea of masts"" in the harbor, ""streets jammed with carts and wheel barrows, buildings ""rising everywhere."" But that harbor became something ominous as well: a magnet for the world's microbes and maladies. Diseases like scarlet fever, measles, typhus and ""throat distemper"" (diphtheria) came in giant waves. Yet for sheer terror, nothing quite matched cholera, which repeatedly brought New York to a stop.

A bacterial disease, spread through food and water contaminated by the excrement of infected victims, cholera causes the body to expel enormous quantities of liquids through vomiting and explosive diarrhea. There is no incubation period. The victim can be fine in the morning and dead by nightfall.

Having not a clue as to its cause, authorities blamed it on miasmas and slum-dwelling immigrants -- in this case, the Irish. ""As a class of people,"" wrote one New York physician, ""they are exceedingly dirty, exhausted by drunkenness, and crowded together in the worst portions of the city."" Certainly his last charge was true. Fleeing the rural starvation of Counties Cork, Kerry and Sligo for the slums of New York City, the Irish lived in ghastly squalor, using whatever water was at hand. In Five Points, their primary neighborhood, that meant a series of shallow wells polluted by fecal waste from backyard privies.

The result was predictable. The foreign-born accounted for 71% of the deaths from the 1832 cholera epidemic, at a time when immigrants were barely 10% of New York City's population. Sympathy was in short supply. Indeed, the response from many quarters was even harsher than Jefferson's view of Philadelphia. ""Those sickened must be cured or die off,"" wrote an unforgiving New York official, ""& being chiefly of the very scum of the city, the quicker their dispatch, the sooner the malady will cease.""

How did other New Yorkers approach cholera? In medieval fashion: They quarantined the victims and then humbled themselves before God. Sermons, prayers and fasting were highly recommended; if all else failed, run like hell. One observer compared the exodus of ""well-filled stage coaches"" during the summer of 1832 to the stampede from Pompeii ""when the red lava flowed."" Social distancing favored the rich. Those with means weren't inclined to stick around.

Two decades later, a brilliant British physician named John Snow would introduce the modern field of epidemiology by mapping cholera deaths surrounding a polluted well in central London. He showed that the disease was transmitted not by noxious fumes in the atmosphere but rather by something in the drinking water, which he couldn't actually see. His so-called Ghost Map convinced local authorities to remove the well's pump handle -- and the epidemic ceased. In 1884, German researcher Robert Koch identified that mysterious agent, Vibrio cholerae, under a microscope, a discovery that helped to demolish the miasma theory for good.

Some deadly diseases came and went; others, such as tuberculosis, typhoid fever and smallpox, lingered for centuries, despite medical breakthroughs that included Edward Jenner's miraculous smallpox vaccine. In comparison to Europe, where bacterial research had begun in earnest by the mid-19th century, American medicine proved somewhat slow to give up old habits and ideas, from bleeding and purging the patient to the acceptance of germ theory, which stipulated that invisible organisms caused specific diseases and that antiseptic methods might be employed to halt their spread. In 1870, one child in five born in New York City would not live to see his first birthday, and 25% of those who did reach adulthood would die before the age of 30.

The unfettered optimism surrounding the era of Salk and miracle drugs was understandable, if somewhat premature. The U.S. had recently survived a depression and won a two-front global war. The atomic age had dawned. Science and technology were riding high. Nothing now seemed beyond the reach of the laboratory to heal or to prevent. Some spoke openly of a future without infectious disease. ""Will such a world exist?"" asked one prominent scientist. ""We believe so.""

It hasn't turned out that way. AIDS, SARS, MERS, Zika, Ebola, swine flu, superbugs -- all bear witness to the arrogance of that remark. And yet it's equally true that until a month or two ago, Americans went about their business without the slightest concern that an epidemic on the scale of smallpox or cholera or yellow fever might randomly strike them down.

There's a reason we're emotionally unprepared for what may lie ahead: We simply haven't experienced the extreme cycles of infectious disease that previous generations were forced to endure. We're in frightening new territory, wondering if there is enough protective equipment for medical personnel and first responders, if there are enough test kits and ventilators for possible victims, if an effective vaccine is really a year or so away.

Many wonder as well about the new dangers unleashed by globalization. Germs travel, and the consequences can be severe. But that's the way it's been for centuries, at an admittedly slower pace. Yellow fever and malaria came to North America from Africa; cholera and typhus rode the steamers and ""coffin ships"" that discharged immigrant cargo at our shores. History assures us that Covid-19 will be conquered by science and that another virus, originating in a bat cave, a pig farm or an open-air poultry market somewhere in the world, will rise up to take its place. That's the nature of the beast.

In times like this, when anxiety turns so easily to fear, it sometimes helps to focus upon an optimistic vision of the future. For me, it's the image of a war hero turned president tearfully thanking a selfless researcher for helping to save the children of the world.

Dancing Under the Red Star

By Karl Tobien (2006)

1. Carl Werner had no idea of the life that lay ahead when he left Detroit with his wife and young daughter for Gorky, U.S.S.R., where, as one of 450 Ford employees sent by Henry Ford to the Soviet Union between 1930 and 1932, he was to operate a new manufacturing facility. The life ahead would entail being arrested by the secret police and, shortly after, being killed during Stalin's purge of the late 1930s. Millions were executed. Werner's daughter, Margaret, 17 at the time, saw her father's expression as he was taken away. In ""Dancing Under the Red Star,"" a biography written by her son: ""I saw in his face the end -- the end of his innocently blind optimism and the end of his hopes for our life in this country that was not ours."" Margaret herself was then arrested and sentenced to 10 years in Stalin's gulag, where she endured starvation, fear and hard labor. But she also found friendship and love there -- this, particularly after Stalin's death in 1953. ""It felt as if the master of the house had suddenly died, and all of his grateful servants were beginning to celebrate their new lives."" Her story is a testament to the power of a defiant optimism. She was the only American woman to survive the gulag and return home.

Journey Into the Whirlwind

By Eugenia Ginzburg (1967)

2. ""I don't want to sound pretentious,"" wrote Eugenia Ginzburg, a convinced communist who helped establish the Soviet regime, ""but I must say in all honesty that, had I been ordered to die for the Party . . . I would have obeyed without the slightest hesitation."" But then, in 1937, Ginzburg was arrested on charges that she was a member of a (nonexistent) Trotskyite movement. She spent the first period of her 18-year imprisonment ""in tormented conflict between reason and the kind of foreboding which Lermontov called 'prophetic anguish.'"" She would be transformed by her realization of the guilt she bore for her role in nurturing so monstrous a creation as the Soviet regime, and would write that ""eighteen years of hell on earth are not enough for a fault like mine.""

My Autobiography

By Evgeniia Isaakovna Iaroslavskaia-Markon (2001)

3. Evgeniia Isaakovna Iaroslavskaia-Markon, a philosopher and journalist, had embraced the revolution at the age of 13. As edited and translated by Veronica Shapovalov in ""Remembering the Darkness: Women in Soviet Prisons,"" Iaroslavskaia-Markon confesses that she ""fell in love -- completely and with impassioned sincerity -- with the idea of revolution."" She found Alexander, the man of her life, when she was 20, and in the same year suffered an accident that made it necessary to amputate both her feet. To which event her response is, ""What is the loss of one's feet compared to such a great love as ours?"" When Alexander was arrested after a tour of Western European universities, Iaroslavskaia-Markon's protest against the Soviet state's arbitrariness was immediate, notwithstanding her devotion to the cause of revolution. If the state was criminal, she would be too. She surrounded herself with ""petty criminals"": pickpockets, shoplifters, robbers and punks whose activities she shared until she was caught, taken to jail, sent to a labor camp and sentenced to death. Ever determined to puncture official lies, she wrote in her autobiography, before she was executed in 1931, at the age of 29: ""No state in the world can remain revolutionary, by the very definition of a state.""

Between Shades of Gray

By Ruta Sepetys (2011)

4. ""They took me in my nightgown."" Thus begins Ruta Sepetys's story of her mother, Lina, age 15 in 1941, when the Soviet secret police barged into her home in Lithuania and arrested her along with her younger brother and her mother. The account follows a familiar pattern: prison, a long journey to Siberia, hard labor, starvation, extreme cold. The family is then taken to the north, to chop wood. The sign they see upon their arrival reads ""Trofimovsk."" They are at the top of the Arctic Circle. When Lina's mother asks for a stove for the jurta -- the common barracks the prisoners built out of mud -- the guard replies: ""You'd like a stove? What else? A hot bath? A glass of cognac? Shut up and get to work."" Lina's salvation was artwork. ""After everyone was asleep, I drew by moonlight."" The worst thing was the darkness. ""In the polar region, the sun falls below the horizon for 180 days. Darkness for nearly half a year."" The prisoners were convinced that if they endured the first long winter without the sun, they'd survive. On a morning six months after they arrived, Lina left the jurta to chop wood. ""I began my walk through the snow,"" she recalls. ""That's when I saw it. A tiny sliver of gold appeared between the shades of gray on the horizon. I stared at the amber band of sunlight, smiling. The sun had returned.""

Unedited Life

By Valentina Grigorievna Ievleva-Pavlenko (2001)

5. Arrested after the end of World War II on charges of spying for the West, Valentina Grigorievna Ievleva-Pavlenko was sentenced to a six-year term in the gulag. She would go on to labor in Russia's far north and in Eastern Siberia. A woman who regularly told herself she was not a slave and would not accept being one, she escaped one night to look for her lover, Boris, also a prisoner. Her account, also included in the anthology ""Remembering the Darkness,"" attests to the joy she took from this exercise of her will, though in the end she was caught and dragged to the guards' barracks. There, ""the whole platoon began to beat me."" Through the hellishness of the gulag she was sustained, her story suggests, largely by love affairs with men she met there, prisoners like herself, and also by her close friendships with women prisoners.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Central Banks Struggle to Confront Threats to Markets

The world's major central banks are straining to tamp down threats to financial markets and the global economy created by the coronavirus pandemic, held back by limited tools and a new kind of risk from outside the financial system they are set up to manage.

Stocks rallied Friday, in part on signs of progress in Congress toward passing measures to support the economy. However, beneath the surface, Wall Street was under growing pressure as financial firms rushed out of complex bond-market trades that pushed up long-term U.S. Treasury borrowing rates, which typically go down in a crisis.

In response, the Federal Reserve accelerated a program announced just a day earlier to pump funds into the financial system and stabilize the rise in long-term interest rates and other credit costs.

The Bank of Canada cut its main policy rate by a half-percentage point Friday, while the European Central Bank sought to reassure investors and governments about its support a day after ECB President Christine Lagarde sent unnerving signals of a limited response from Frankfurt. China's central bank pumped roughly $80 billion into commercial banks as part of continuing efforts to ensure the stability of its financial system. Australia's central bank also added funds to its banking system.

""There is every reason to be concerned that what we're seeing on the ground with this virus and in this market, the response [of global central banks] might not be big enough,"" said Bruce Kasman, head of economic research at J.P. Morgan.

The world's central banks are trying to manage several shocks simultaneously. The most pressing problem Friday was reducing market disruptions tied to economic uncertainty.

Market mayhem turned from falling stock prices to bond volatility not seen since the financial crisis over a decade ago.

The Fed and other central banks are responding by making sure banks are flush with funds to back loans, credit lines and trading so the economy's problems aren't compounded by a malfunctioning financial system. The central bank said Friday it would pump $37 billion into the system by purchasing Treasury securities from banks.

The next problem will be finding ways to stimulate economic growth as consumer and business activity slows in many nations. While central banks have ample resources to pump money into the financial system, they are constrained in how much they can stimulate the broader economy because interest rates are already very low.

U.S. News: Florida Legislature Passes A Weakened E-Verify Bill

MIAMI -- Florida lawmakers passed a bill late Thursday that requires some employers to use the federal E-Verify system to check the immigration status of new hires, but doesn't include the strict enforcement provisions for which conservatives had advocated.

The measure comes in a presidential election year in which President Trump is expected to campaign in part on his aggressive crackdown on illegal immigration. Florida, which has a large immigrant population, but also a Republican base animated by opposition to illegal immigration, will likely be a key battleground.

The bill passed the Florida Senate 23-17, after clearing the state House 73-45 a day earlier. It is now headed to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, an ally of Mr. Trump who is expected to sign it.

The bill would make Florida the 21st state to require use of the federal E-Verify program, an electronic government database that checks whether new hires are eligible to work in the U.S., according to LawLogix, a software company that specializes in immigration compliance.

While employers praised lawmakers for removing the bill's most stringent enforcement provisions, some still criticized the state for passing any version of an E-Verify bill. They argued immigration legislation should be handled by Congress, not by individual states that thereby create an inconsistent patchwork for companies.

Paul DiMare, president of DiMare Fresh, a large tomato grower in Florida, said he already struggles to fill jobs, 30% to 40% of which are vacant at his company. An E-Verify measure will make it even harder by scaring away workers, he added. ""As soon as you put in E-Verify, they will move to another state,"" he said. ""It's a destruction of our businesses.""

E-Verify legislation has failed repeatedly in Florida in recent years. It has faced strong opposition from business and agricultural groups that rely on immigrant labor and from lawmakers in districts with large immigrant populations.

This year, lawmakers reached a compromise that hands Mr. DeSantis a partial victory, but appeases the concerns of some opponents.

Though the GOP governor had pushed for a bill that would require all employers to use E-Verify, lawmakers weakened it -- in part to appease House members, including Republican Speaker Jose Oliva, uncomfortable with some enforcement provisions. The version passed by lawmakers would mandate E-Verify only for public employers and companies that contract with them.

Private employers would have a choice either to use E-Verify or rely on I-9 employment authorization forms already required for businesses. Advocates of stronger immigration enforcement said the bill didn't go far enough.

""A better way to start with state-based E-Verify legislation is to start with requiring state agencies and contractors or certain industries to use it and build on that,"" said Jessica M. Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, a group arguing for lower levels of immigration. ""But you can't give employers the choice.""

The current version stripped out controversial aspects in an earlier iteration. They included a provision allowing the state's economic-development office to conduct random audits of employment files of firms that don't use E-Verify. Business groups assailed those parts of the bill as empowering a state agency to become an arm of federal immigration authorities. Under the current bill, private employers face just an additional paperwork rule: To retain for at least three years the documentation workers provide as part of the I-9 verification process.

""They didn't get everything they wanted, but they were still able to pass legislation that undermines business and scapegoats immigrants,"" said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, which works with businesses that support liberalized immigration legislation.

World News: Israeli Leaders to Weigh Unity Government

TEL AVIV -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and rival Benny Gantz agreed to discuss forming a unity government, saying the threat from the new coronavirus made it necessary to end the yearlong political stalemate.

The talks offer a potential lifeline for Mr. Netanyahu, who is trying to remain in power as he goes on trial for corruption charges next week. Mr. Gantz's Blue and White party previously objected to any unity government that allowed Mr. Netanyahu to remain prime minister while under indictment, while Mr. Netanyahu's Likud party insisted he serve first in any rotation agreement.

""It's a Hail Mary pass,"" said Shalom Lipner, who worked for several Israeli prime ministers including Mr. Netanyahu and is now with the Atlantic Council think tank. ""There's public desperation over both the coronavirus and the political situation.""

The two leaders spoke by phone Thursday evening, during which Mr. Gantz said the parties' negotiators should meet to urgently discuss forming an emergency government, according to his spokeswoman.

Three elections in just under one year have proved inconclusive. Previous talks on a unity government in September broke down following disagreements on who would first serve as prime minister.

The epidemic offers impetus for Messrs. Netanyahu and Gantz to set aside animosity and end interim rule. Israel has already taken extraordinary measures to address the outbreak, including requiring all foreign arrivals to self-quarantine.

The talks follow two weeks of wrangling by Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz to find paths to ruling without the backing of the other. The Likud party came out of elections on March 2 as the largest party with 36 seats, with Mr. Gantz's party the second biggest with 33, but neither has enough support for the 61 seats needed to form a governing coalition.

Obstacles remain, with both politicians calling for an emergency unity government but neither saying which parties would be part of the coalition.

Mr. Gantz said Thursday that Blue and White ""would be willing to discuss establishing a national emergency government that would include representation of all parts of the house,"" which many took to mean including the Joint List group of Arab parties. The two politicians disagreed about what role the Joint List would play in such a government, Mr. Netanyahu's office said Friday.

World News: Baghdad Angered by U.S. Strikes On Militia Group

WASHINGTON -- Iraqi officials reacted angrily to American airstrikes against an Iran-backed group on Iraqi soil, contributing to increased U.S.-Iraqi tensions as the two countries attempt to jointly defeat terrorist groups operating there.

The Pentagon said Thursday it had carried out a series of strikes against weapons facilities belonging to Kataib Hezbollah, or KH, an Iran-backed, Shiite militia group based in Iraq that repeatedly has staged rocket attacks against American forces there, U.S. military officials said.

The U.S. airstrikes, which occurred early Friday in Baghdad, were in response to an attack by KH that killed three coalition members, including two Americans, and injured 14 more. The U.S., operating alone, used manned aircraft to target five weapons-storage sites across central Iraq, officials said. The Iraqi military said six individuals, none of whom were members of KH, had been killed in the strikes.

President Barham Salih denounced the American airstrikes and said they further undermined the state's authority, making it harder for Iraq to deal with multiple crises, including a coronavirus outbreak, a political vacuum and a looming economic crunch.

Mr. Salih warned that Iraq risked sliding into chaos and said there already were signs that Islamic State, which was largely defeated, was reconstituting itself. Iraq's foreign minister summoned the American and British ambassadors following the strikes and anti-U.S. politicians renewed their calls for the expulsion of foreign forces.

Earlier this year, pro-Iranian members of the Iraqi parliament spearheaded a vote to eject all of the approximately 5,000 American forces from Iraq following the U.S. airstrike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the top Iranian general, in Iraq Jan. 3. The U.S. has tried to resolve the dispute with the Iraqi government while maintaining U.S. force levels there to prevent Islamic State from staging attacks in the country.

Gen. Frank McKenzie, the head of U.S. Central Command, which oversees operations in the Middle East, said that Friday's strikes were defensive in nature and that the weapons storage-facilities destroyed were legitimate targets.

""We assessed that each location stored weapons that would enable lethal operations against U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq,"" Gen. McKenzie told reporters at the Pentagon Friday. ""We also assessed that the destruction of these sites will degrade Kataib Hezbollah's ability to conduct future strikes.""

Gen. McKenzie said the U.S. consulted with the Iraqi government after the strikes on the weapons facilities.

He also said a Patriot missile system, which can defend against a ballistic missile strike like the one launched by Iran after the killing of Gen. Soleimani, would soon be installed and operable within Iraq.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: States Vary on Virus Approach

The Newport City Council narrowly voted Tuesday to allow its 64th annual St. Patrick's Day parade to march on Saturday, siding with community members who warned that canceling would signal that the coastal Rhode Island tourist town is closed for business.

""Don't choke,"" Jack Milburn, a retired firefighter, urged Newport council members from the podium.

Some 24 hours later, the same City Council voted unanimously to nix the parade after Gov. Gina Raimondo asked people not to attend events for more than 250 people for the next two weeks.

With limited information and facing extreme time pressure, county-level officials, mayors and governors from New Jersey to Washington state issued a patchwork of edicts and directions this week. They moved to try to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus, in some cases making hard decisions to overturn beloved traditions and disappoint constituents. With the gravity of the situation setting in, most public officials have chosen to cancel events or limit crowds, but U.S. states and municipalities thus far are taking divergent approaches to the new virus.

""We understand that people have to live their lives, and business has to continue, however we have only one chance to contain this,"" Ms. Raimondo said, warning there would need to be ""radical change"" in behaviors for a period of time.

The government's message helped Mr. Milburn come around to the idea that Newport's parade should be canceled, he said.

Confirmed cases of the new coronavirus in the U.S. have topped 1,700, including 40 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Roughly 80% of cases tend to be mild or moderate. But those who are older or have underlying health conditions are at a higher risk.

In California's Santa Clara County, which has been particularly hard-hit, county health officials initially banned events with 1,000 people or more before revising that number to 100 on Friday, while Riverside County, which has reported fewer than 10 local cases, ordered the Coachella music festival and all events with 250 people or more canceled or postponed.

New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo banned most gatherings of more than 500 people, a move that darkened Broadway shows. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee halted events of 250 people or more in three counties. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine squashed many get-togethers topping 100 people.

The disparate responses stem from the fact that most public-health powers rest with states, said Lawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University.

""Unlike Italy or China, the United States Constitution is a federalist constitution, and it gives virtually all public health powers to the states,"" he said.

That philosophy has long prevailed in states like California, which has 58 counties and more than five dozen local health departments.

""What we are doing is a bottom-up process not a top-down process. I think the local health officials should make those determinations,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom said this week.

That may be easier said than done.

In a statement the same day, San Mateo County public health officer Scott Morrow said he had been asked to make ""significant policy decisions"" with very little information. Mr. Morrow had recommended canceling all nonessential gatherings but acknowledged he could offer no standard definition of that term. ""Use your best judgment,"" he said.

With nearly 30 years of experience in public health, Mr. Morrow said, ""If I am filled with uncertainty, I can only imagine how the general public must be feeling.""

New guidance issued by Mr. Newsom in California Wednesday urged canceling or postponing large events such as concerts, conferences and sporting events of 250 people, and even smaller ones if social distance couldn't be maintained.

""These are tricky decisions,"" said Jon Mitchell, mayor of New Bedford, Mass., 60 miles south of Boston.

Mr. Mitchell earlier this week called off the New Bedford Half Marathon, which was set for Sunday. Thousands of runners penned in at the start, sweating and coughing and spitting, ""makes for a 3,000-person petri dish,"" he said in an interview Thursday. ""I woke up in the morning and said, 'No way can we do this race.'""

Local officials face a fundamental problem, he said: A lack of information because so few people have been tested relative to populations. That means cities can't easily isolate infected people, leaving two main steps of recourse: good hygiene and keeping people away from one another.

Diverse responses aren't problematic in themselves, said Yaneer Bar-Yam, a scientist at the New England Complex Systems Institute, a research institution that has studied community response to pandemics.

The ability to be nimble and implement different responses ""frees up the system to change,"" he said.

A greater risk is ""people really don't understand that there are these superspreader events,"" he said. A number of coronavirus outbreaks around the world had superspreader events, from a food market in China to a religious service in South Korea, he said.

At a mass gathering in the U.S. right now, the ""chance that no one is sick is almost zero,"" he said.

Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner this week halted the remainder of the city's biggest annual event, the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, after the first area coronavirus case not tied to international travel. ""That changed things,"" he said at a news conference.

But 85 miles away, in Beaumont, organizers of the big annual South Texas State Fair, set to start March 26, are proceeding. They will cancel if mandated to do so, but hope that doesn't happen, said Marc Richardson, a lead volunteer. The fair raises money for children's causes.

Mr. Richardson, who thinks there may be excessive panic about the coronavirus, hadn't been surprised to see Austin shut down the South by Southwest festival over coronavirus concerns, but was stunned to hear about Houston.

""Austin is much more of a liberal area, but Houston?"" he said. ""That's the closest thing we have to the Wild West.""

Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said she welcomed Mr. Inslee's approach, which was made in consultation with city officials and based on modeling that estimated a 50% reduction of contact through social distancing could result in a 75% to 80% reduction in the number of potential infections and deaths in the region through April 7. ""This disease is not going to respect a city line, a county line or state lines,"" she said.

Boeing Probe Centers on Claim MAX Trainer Misled Regulators

Federal authorities are seeking to build a criminal case against a former Boeing Co. pilot based on statements from U.S. air-safety regulators who say he failed to provide them crucial details about the 737 MAX jet's flight-control system, according to people familiar with the matter.

A pair of Federal Aviation Administration officials who dealt with Boeing pilot Mark Forkner on pilot-training requirements for the FAA's approval process years before dual crashes of the MAX are now considered key witnesses in the investigation, these people said.

The central role of FAA officials Stacey Klein and William Schubbe in the criminal probe hasn't been reported before. It suggests Justice Department prosecutors and federal investigators are seeking to center a fraud case on claims that Mr. Forkner misled regulators about how a flight-control feature known as MCAS worked. Ms. Klein oversaw MAX pilot manuals and training, while Mr. Schubbe is a manager in the FAA office that helps determine pilot-training requirements for new aircraft.

The automated MCAS system has been blamed for putting two Boeing 737s into fatal nosedives within five months, taking 346 lives, prompting a grounding of the fleet and creating the most serious corporate crisis in Boeing's history.

A case against Mr. Forkner -- who left Boeing for a job with Southwest Airlines Co. after the MAX was certified by the FAA -- could lead to liability for the Chicago aerospace giant as well. Prosecutors typically have grounds to charge a company for criminal conduct once they have formally accused an employee of misconduct.

Mr. Forkner hasn't cooperated with the investigation, according to people familiar with his situation.

Mr. Forkner's attorneys, David Gerger and Matt Hennessy, said the FAA was aware of how MCAS worked.

""As far as Mark goes, he did his job honestly, and his communications to the FAA were honest,"" Mr. Forkner's lawyers said. ""As a pilot and Air Force vet, he would never jeopardize the safety of other pilots or their passengers. That is what any fair investigation would find.""

Boeing has cooperated with the federal investigations. It has said it was investigating the circumstances surrounding Mr. Forkner's 2016 messages and would share its findings with authorities. Boeing has faulted flawed engineering assumptions about how pilots would respond to MCAS cockpit emergencies, and it is devising software and training fixes.

Boeing also must navigate an end to a civil investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, one of the people said, which could allege its disclosures to investors didn't fully communicate important facts or risks related to the 737 MAX.

Ms. Klein couldn't be reached for comment. Through an FAA spokesman, Mr. Schubbe declined to comment. The spokesman said Ms. Klein, Mr. Schubbe and their colleagues are trained to do highly specialized jobs in a professional manner.

Internal Boeing emails from Mr. Forkner, released over the past few months, described pressure he felt from Boeing superiors in 2016 and 2017 to persuade the FAA that pilots wouldn't need extra ground-simulator training on MCAS. Mr. Forkner sent other messages to Boeing employees indicating that, as part of those efforts, he misled or provided incomplete information to the agency as well as airlines and foreign regulators. Congressional investigators, along with other Boeing critics, have highlighted Mr. Forkner's casual remarks regarding safety in those messages.

Mr. Gerger, the lawyer for Mr. Forkner, has previously said the messages should be understood as the comments of employees blowing off steam ""in the ups and downs of their jobs.""

A Boeing spokesman declined to comment. A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.

Mr. Forkner, who at the time was Boeing's chief technical pilot for the 737 MAX, persuaded Ms. Klein's group to remove references to MCAS from aircraft manuals, arguing pilots didn't need to know about the system because it would rarely, if ever, activate, according to his emails.

Ms. Klein has been involved in devising new pilot training for the modified MCAS system, but recently went on leave for a personal reason unrelated to the criminal investigation and the MAX, a person familiar with her testimony said. Aaron Perkins, a former commercial pilot who joined the FAA in 2011 and was involved in the MAX approval process, has taken over her role vetting training related to MCAS software fixes.

Mr. Perkins has told prosecutors he feels Mr. Forkner misled him and his colleagues before the plane went into service, according to one person familiar with his statements. Through an agency spokesman, Mr. Perkins declined to comment.

In August 2016, Ms. Klein was among the FAA employees who participated in test flights of the MAX, which used the final, more powerful version of MCAS, according to people familiar with the matter. It couldn't be learned whether those flights involved tests of MCAS or exposed its potential hazards. An earlier version of the system worked only at high speeds and was less potent.

Mr. Forkner was thrust into the spotlight last year when it emerged that in a 2016 instant message he acknowledged misleading regulators. ""So I basically lied to the regulators (unknowingly),"" Mr. Forkner told a fellow Boeing pilot, suggesting he hadn't known at the time he talked to the FAA that engineers had modified MCAS to make it more powerful.

Mr. Gerger has said Mr. Forkner was discussing the performance of a simulator built to mirror the handling of a 737 Max. Mr. Forkner believed the problem was with that simulator, Mr. Gerger has said, and not with the plane itself.

Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun has called Mr. Forkner's messages ""totally appalling,"" while company representatives repeatedly have said his communications contradicted Boeing's core values and commitment to safety.

A spokeswoman for Southwest said Mr. Forkner isn't focused on MAX-related work and has complied with company and federal standards applicable to pilots.

Over the months, prosecutors have interviewed current and former Boeing engineers and pilots, airline pilot-union officials and various FAA employees, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Forkner's former boss, Zekeriya Demir, is among the other Boeing employees who have been called to testify before the grand jury hearing evidence, the people said.

Mr. Demir's testimony hasn't been reported. He couldn't be reached for comment. The New York Times previously reported that prosecutors were gathering grand jury testimony about whether Mr. Forkner misled FAA officials.

Boeing has long insisted the FAA was aware of the system's final configuration, which was described in a letter and a number of presentations to the agency, though its revised power was never flagged to senior managers.

EXCHANGE --- Harvard Pressed on Dean Search

Several stakeholders of Harvard Business School are pushing the university to name a new dean who will use the school's clout to raise awareness on social issues ranging from climate change to diversity in hiring.

Harvard Business School has been on the hunt for a new boss since November when Nitin Nohria, the current dean, said he planned to step down in June after 10 years on the job. Since then, several student and alumni groups have sent letters to the president of Harvard University, Lawrence Bacow, asking for a more diverse hire, such as a woman or person of color, or someone who will voice support for certain ideologies, such as the benefits of stakeholder-focused capitalism.

Last month, more than 250 HBS students signed a letter to the school's search committee asking that the new dean prioritize taking ""the challenge of revamping the curriculum to reflect environmental and societal challenges seriously.""

The letter was written by two M.B.A. students from the class of 2021, Tarun Galagali and Tomas Rosales, who co-chair the Next Generation Capitalism group on campus. The letter stated they are encouraged by the steps Harvard has taken in recent years to modernize the business school's curriculum but more can still be done. The students said they met with the provost this week in a constructive meeting to discuss the points they raise in the letter.

""The new dean should be someone who challenges orthodoxy when he or she thinks it's stale and has a track record of doing so,"" Mr. Galagali said in an interview.

A university spokesman declined to comment on the school's search process.

In January, HBS's African-American Alumni Association sent a letter urging Harvard's president to prioritize diversity and inclusion in the search.

The university said the search for the new dean won't be delayed despite the coronavirus outbreak, and those involved in the search process will continue to take any precautions warranted.

The current dean is facing the challenge of Harvard students finishing the semester's classes remotely via online learning platforms. Tuesday, the university told students to move out of their campus housing by Sunday and not to return until further notice.

Trevor Hill, co-president of HBS's energy and environment club, said he would like to see a dean who throws the weight of the school behind specific policy solutions that combat climate change. He sent a letter to the dean search committee in February asking for a leader who will push leaders in the corporate world for action.

Fed Slashes Rates as Slump Looms --- Central bank to buy $700 billion in debt as coronavirus pushes U.S. toward recession

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate to near zero on Sunday and unleashed an aggressive set of additional moves aimed at stabilizing markets as the new coronavirus pushed the U.S. economy toward a recession.

The Fed, delivering an unprecedented second emergency rate cut in as many weeks, said it would cut the federal-funds rate to a range between 0% and 0.25%, down 1 percentage point, and would buy $700 billion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, among other actions.

The Fed's actions capped three days of federal responses to the rising economic risks posed by the virus, including President Trump's emergency declaration Friday and the House's passage of financial-assistance legislation Saturday.

Dow Jones Industrial Average futures slid about 1,040 points, or 4.6%, while S&P 500 futures fell 5% to again hit a limit designed to stall further drops. Overseas early Monday, Japan's Nikkei Stock Average was up slightly, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was down 1.7%.

""The virus presents significant economic challenges,"" Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said during a telephone press conference Sunday night. ""The measures now being put in place to stem its spread will have a significant effect on economic activity in the near term.""

The central bank will buy at least $500 billion in Treasury securities and $200 billion in mortgage-backed securities over the coming months to help unclog markets that grew dysfunctional last week. It said it would initiate the program, called quantitative easing, on Monday.

The Fed said it was activating with five other central banks, including the European Central Bank and Bank of England, swap lines to smooth out disruptions in overseas dollar-funding markets, effectively encouraging foreign central banks to use existing facilities to supply dollars to their own financial systems.

The coronavirus crisis has escalated in recent days, with business closures and event cancellations cascading across the country. Companies sent workers home, and smaller businesses grappled with how to survive. Consumers, meanwhile, stocked up for an uncertain period where they are being asked to stay at home to combat the virus's spread.

Many Wall Street forecasters now expect the economy will fall into recession during the first half of the year, and the shape of the recovery could be determined largely by how local, state and federal health officials mitigate the spread of the virus.

""The Fed is trying to prevent a health crisis from mutating into a financial crisis,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at accounting firm Grant Thornton.

JPMorgan Chase economists project U.S. output will decline at an annual rate of 2% in the first quarter and 3% in the second. They believe the economy will rebound quickly in the second half of the year, contingent on a $500 billion fiscal response from Congress.

Intense market volatility prompted the Fed to take several unusual steps last week to arrest strains in the Treasury market. Those included offering nearly unlimited amounts of short-term lending to a group of 24 big banks, known as primary dealers, that function as the Fed's exclusive counterparties when trading in financial markets. When banks were slow to take the Fed up on those loans, it pivoted Friday to buying $37 billion in Treasurys in one swoop.

But late Friday it appeared those actions hadn't restored normal functioning in the Treasury market -- let alone in riskier ones for mortgage bonds, commercial debt and municipal credit, prompting an even bolder approach on Sunday.

""Market function improved a little bit, but still, it wasn't what we needed,"" Mr. Powell said Sunday.

Treasury and mortgage-bond markets ""are part of the foundation of the global financial system. . .If they are not functioning well, then that will spread to other markets,"" Mr. Powell said.

Mortgage rates, for example, spiked last week amid signs of dysfunction in the market for mortgage bonds that are government guaranteed, which could have hurt what has been a strong housing market. ""They can't allow that to happen,"" Ms. Swonk said.

Over the weekend, the House passed legislation that would make testing for the novel coronavirus free and provide paid sick leave to certain workers affected by the outbreak, and Washington leaders promised more aid was coming. The bill is likely to clear the Senate this week before President Trump signs it into law.

Congress had already approved about $8 billion in funding to develop virus treatments and help for states. Mr. Trump issued on Friday an emergency declaration that he said would free up tens of billions of dollars in emergency funding.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday that he doesn't think the U.S. is in a recession, but that the administration would continue working with Congress to combat the virus's spread and help the economy.

Let the Fed Administer an Antiviral Shot

If you've seen one financial crisis, you've seen one financial crisis.

The policy pronouncements and tools used in 2008 by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and his crisis-fighters weren't designed to address the current threat. Yet Chairman Jerome Powell fired a 2008-style barrage Sunday evening.

Cutting interest rates to near zero, purchasing hundreds of billions of long-term Treasury bonds and agency securities, making commitments to hold rates down for a long time -- the monetary arsenal of 2008-09 -- will likely be of only modest help this time around. The old weapons must be paired with new ones fit for the 2020 pandemic.

The novel coronavirus has been moving faster than the world's economic policy makers, threatening to shut down the global economy as it approaches. Yet the Fed possesses powerful untapped authority, and with the help of Congress and the administration there is much it can do to improve economic prospects.

U.S. public-health officials acknowledge that the window to contain the virus has passed. They have pivoted to a policy of mitigation, trying to buy time so that the health-care system can manage the influx of cases. Economic policy makers must make an equally forceful pivot to save the economy from a deep and painful recession.

In consultation with the Treasury secretary and congressional leaders, the Fed should immediately invoke its emergency powers under Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act and establish a new credit facility to ensure that sound businesses and households have ready access to cash to get through the crisis.

A new Government-Backed Credit Facility, or GBCF, would require everyone to have skin in the game: all parts of the government, all institutions in the banking system, and a broad cross-section of small businesses, large corporations and households.

The Fed board of governors would authorize the program and ensure its accord with Walter Bagehot's dictum: lend freely to solvent firms and individuals on good collateral at interest rates higher than are customary.

Thousands of regulated banks would be on the front lines. They would underwrite loans based on the quality and value of collateral and the expected cash flows of borrowers, evaluating applicants based on their credentials as of Jan. 1, before the pandemic. Borrowers would need to demonstrate that they are unable to obtain credit elsewhere but are solvent, consistent with the requirements of the Federal Reserve Act.

The 12 geographically dispersed banks in the Federal Reserve system would judge whether the loans underwritten in their region pass muster. The New York Fed would evaluate each package of loans, and price them at spreads modestly higher than would be customary in normal times.

Loans would be for a term of up to 90 days, subject to renewal as long as the virus is affecting the economy. The GBCF would have a maximum life of 18 months. If the virus dissipates quickly, the Fed's program would be wound down quickly as well.

The president could authorize the Treasury secretary to use funds from the Exchange Stabilization Fund to kick-start the program by providing assurance to the Fed that there is sufficient collateral to support it. Crucially, Congress would also authorize a fiscal backstop to offset any loan losses incurred by the Fed or the banks themselves. These actions would maintain an appropriate line between monetary and fiscal policy.

The establishment of the GBCF is the right response to this crisis. The economy was fundamentally strong and prospects were promising before the onset of the pandemic. U.S. households' earnings were growing at the highest rate in decades, and the household savings rate was high. Business profit levels remained strong, and the banking system was sound.

Owing to the virus, many U.S. households and businesses are expected to face a liquidity crisis. It must be managed quickly and effectively so it doesn't turn into a solvency crisis. More traditional Keynesian fiscal stimulus to spur immediate consumer spending is at odds with the public-health measures adopted by the president to slow economic activity for a time.

In 2008, I recall sitting along the wall of the Roosevelt Room at the White House. Mr. Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson sat at the main table across from President George W. Bush. They were seeking the president's support for a set of extraordinary policy moves to help the U.S. economy survive the financial crisis. Mr. Bush listened intently, and before granting his approval, he said something that caused me to take particular note. In paraphrase: ""When this is over, you guys better think hard how this all happened and why we were all so unprepared. No one sitting in these chairs again should find themselves with so few options.""

Policy makers should have used the long period after the financial crisis to give more consideration to the eternally salient question: What could possibly go wrong? But now is no time for navel gazing, or cutting and pasting the response from the last crisis. Policy makers should move with dispatch and confidence to a new paradigm to respond to a different kind of economic shock.

At a time of government dysfunction and division, pettiness and partisanship, the Fed would be wise to lead the effort, consistent with its mission as lender of last resort, with support and backstop funding from the administration and Congress.

U.S. News: Roundabout Wrecks Have Engineers Going in Circles

City planners and engineers are stumped over why so many drivers can't handle something as simple as a roundabout.

Roundabouts have proliferated around the U.S. in recent years, arriving in some areas of the Midwest and West for the first time. Yet even years after some are installed, driver confusion persists. And with confusion comes fender-benders.

Traffic engineers say the majority of crashes in two-lane roundabouts occur either because drivers don't yield to circulating traffic, or they make improper lane changes once in the roundabout.

Authorities have boosted public education, tweaked signs and modified roadway designs in search of solutions. The federal government is leading a study on drivers' failure to yield to traffic when entering two-lane roundabouts, a major cause of collisions. State transportation departments from Washington to New York are helping fund the research.

""We just need to find out a reason why,"" said Wei Zhang, who manages intersection-safety research at the U.S. Department of Transportation.

Roundabouts differ from higher-speed rotaries common in the Northeast. While they can have multiple lanes, they are smaller than rotaries and often require cars to slow down to around 15 miles an hour.

Converting an intersection with a traffic signal to a roundabout results in a 78% decrease in fatalities and injuries, according to the Federal Highway Administration. The downside has been more crashes, mostly fender-benders, at many two-lane roundabouts.

The crash problem has been a ""dirty little secret"" in the traffic field, said Letty Schamp, deputy engineer for the city of Hilliard, Ohio. ""Now people are talking about it.""

Ms. Schamp considers one roundabout her baby because she has worked on the project since it began more than a decade ago, when the area had few roundabouts. The two-lane circular intersection has had more than 660 crashes since it opened in 2012, averaging 82 a year. That is compared with eight a year at the intersection that existed previously, city figures show.

The roundabout was intended to add capacity and improve traffic flow while reducing speeds, without creating a sea of asphalt, and it achieved those goals, she said. About 35,000 vehicles pass through each day.

Hilliard resident Pam Saraniero didn't realize she had to yield to cars in both lanes of the roundabout, and learned the hard way. In January, she said she saw a Ford Escape moving in the inner lane as she approached the roundabout. Then she drove into the circle, hitting the Escape and knocking the front bumper off her Honda Accord.

In hindsight, she said she wrongly assumed the other driver would loop around the roundabout rather than exit across her path. ""It was my fault, absolutely,"" the 67-year-old retiree said.

Jane Wahl, who also crashed there in January, said approaching drivers often race into the roundabout. ""Not everybody has the same attitude about what the rules are in these roundabouts,"" she said.

Last year, Hilliard launched a public-outreach campaign, and officials modified signs and lane markings. The 63 crashes in 2019 were the fewest since the roundabout opened, though Ms. Schamp said she isn't ready to declare victory. While she remains bullish on roundabouts, she said she isn't keen to build any more two-lane versions.

Of the more than 6,000 modern roundabouts that have been built since around 1990, roughly a quarter have multiple lanes in some configuration, according to a database maintained by Oregon transportation engineering firm Kittelson & Associates Inc.

""We're trading a severe crash -- say, a T-bone crash at a conventional signalized intersection -- for a fender-bender. Nine out of 10 engineers are willing to make that trade,"" said Lee Rodegerdts, a principal engineer at Kittelson, which is working on the federal study. ""It's a fender-bender problem, but it's one we're very actively trying to solve.""

U.S. News: Trump Weighs Pardon For Flynn

WASHINGTON -- President Trump said he is considering a full pardon for former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with a top Russian official.

Mr. Trump in a tweet Sunday criticized the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Justice Department, saying they had ""destroyed"" Mr. Flynn's life, and pointed to what he said was a report that the agencies had ""lost"" records in the case. It wasn't clear what report Mr. Trump was referring to.

""I am strongly considering a Full Pardon!"" he wrote.

The White House didn't comment beyond the tweet, which came as the administration continues to grapple with the fast-moving coronavirus emergency. The FBI and Justice Department declined to comment.

Mr. Flynn in late 2017 admitted he misled FBI agents about a series of calls he had with Moscow's ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Kislyak, about sanctions and a United Nations resolution critical of Israel. Prosecutors said Mr. Flynn consulted with Trump transition officials on the contacts.

""I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and, through my faith in God, I am working to set things right,"" Mr. Flynn said at the time.

Federal prosecutors in January asked a court to sentence Mr. Flynn to up to six months in prison, a reversal from when the government said he shouldn't face incarceration due to cooperation in the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mr. Flynn sat for 19 interviews with investigators and provided documents in several criminal probes before the relationship soured.

Mr. Flynn's lawyers subsequently asked a federal judge to allow him to withdraw his guilty plea on a single charge of lying to the FBI, arguing the government had breached its 2017 plea agreement. If that request, which is pending, is granted, Mr. Flynn could face trial.

Don't Credit the Minimum Wage for Growing Paychecks

There's a great irony in the current battle over labor policy. Demands are rising for a $15 minimum wage nationwide at exactly the moment when businesses have returned to granting the most robust raises in many years, with no government mandate necessary. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Usual Weekly Earnings survey, most workers' wages rose a bit more than 10% from December 2016 through December 2019, and those in the bottom 10% got a raise of 15.6%.

Supporters of the higher federal minimum claim that state and local minimum-wage increases are the main cause of recent wage growth. ""Minimum wages probably are the difference that are kicking up wage growth at the bottom to higher levels than other groups in America,"" policy economist Ernie Tedeschi told NPR in January. Yet the data refute the idea that forced raises at the low end have done more to boost wages than the trends in the economy.

For starters, relatively few people earn the minimum wage. According to the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey, only 119,000 workers on average had their pay raised directly by each of the 51 state and local minimum-wage hikes between 2016 and 2019. That's because even those in the 10th income decile -- people who earn less than 90% of their peers -- made $467 a week in December 2019. That's $11.52 an hour, far higher than the federal minimum of $7.25 as well as most state and local minimum wages.

All told, the recent minimum-wage hikes directly increased total wages by $4.2 billion over a three-year period, including for workers whose wages fell somewhere between the old and new minimums. But the increase in wages for production and nonsupervisory workers (those likely to be paid hourly) over that period was $325 billion. So minimum-wage hikes directly accounted for only 1.3% of the total increase in the earnings of hourly workers over that period.

The effect was more concentrated at the bottom. The minimum-wage increases amounted to an $8 increase in weekly pay for the bottom 10% of earners. But the same workers' overall weekly earnings rose by $63 during that period, meaning minimum-wage hikes were responsible for only 13% of their pay gains. The hikes accounted for a mere 5% of the pay gains for the bottom quarter of workers and only 2% of the gains for the bottom half.

To be sure, minimum-wage increases can cause broader raises indirectly by spurring employers to fend off competition with even larger increases. That's the theory advanced by Mr. Tedeschi and others, who interpret the coincidence of mandatory wage hikes and broader raises as a sign of the stimulating power of raising the wage floor. But again, the share of workers who earn anything close to that wage floor is too small to assume that a higher minimum could meaningfully boost wages for the entire bottom quarter. And the fact that unemployment plummeted in the same period shows that the tightening of the labor market was the more likely cause.

The outsize gains at the bottom of the income distribution have been particularly pronounced among African-Americans, whose weekly pay rose 12% from 2016 to 2019, compared with 9.8% for whites. This trend appears to be accelerating. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's Wage Growth Tracker found wage growth for nonwhites exceeding that for whites by 0.8% in the past 12 months -- the equivalent of 2.5% over a three-year period. Before the end of 2016 there was little difference in terms of wage growth between whites and nonwhites.

Other data tell a similarly encouraging story. Inequality dropped under every census measure from 2017 to 2018, bucking a half-century trend. There are signs that we'll see another drop from 2018 to 2019 when the data are published this summer. This is a trend that should be heralded by all Americans. It is proof that the best way to create a more equal distribution of income is to have a robust economy and tight labor market. Long-term economic equality can be achieved not by government decree but by sustaining an economy in which the labor market allows the laws of supply and demand to strengthen workers' positions.

World News: Netanyahu Rival Gets First Shot To Form Coalition

TEL AVIV -- Israel's President Reuven Rivlin will give opposition leader Benny Gantz the first chance to form a government in a blow to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is seeking to hold on to the country's top office while facing charges of corruption.

Mr. Rivlin met throughout the day Sunday with all of the representatives from all of the parties in the Knesset, Israel's parliament, before announcing he will officially offer Mr. Gantz the mandate on Monday.

He then met with Messrs. Gantz and Netanyahu to urge them to form a unity government, or a coalition including parties from both sides of the political spectrum.

Mr. Rivlin views the common political front as essential medicine to combat the threat of the coronavirus in Israel.

Mr. Gantz, beginning Monday, has up to six weeks to try to cobble together a governing coalition after receiving the most support to do so from the members of Israel's 120-seat parliament.

The decision follows three inconclusive elections in the space of a year that has landed Israel in a prolonged state of political paralysis, a situation that has allowed Mr. Netanyahu to hang on as Israel's longest-serving prime minister despite being indicted on a charge of corruption and facing a court trial. The stalemate has prevented Israel's parliament from passing a budget that would fund the government's operations.

""The biggest issue is there's no real budget, they can't do anything without that,"" said Mitchell Barak, a political analyst and director at Keevoon Global Research, a Jerusalem-based consulting firm. ""They need a government and not to go to fourth elections.""

If it's true the novel coronavirus doesn't like warm weather, it could explain why Latin America has yet to report a large outbreak. Much of the region isn't tropical, but most of the temperate zones in the Northern Hemisphere have mild winters, and in many places spring is already arriving.

Too bad the annual thaw can't save the Americas from the economic consequences of a pandemic, exacerbated by a decade of easy money. The meltdown in global stock markets suggests something deeper than a corona recession is at work. And as a version of the old saw goes, when the U.S. gets sick, Latin America gets a lot sicker.

The explanation for the slowdown in the real economy is Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Transmission of the illness isn't well understood, the severity of individual cases varies greatly, and public-health authorities are having trouble getting a grip on how many people have been infected.

The virus killed a 34-year-old doctor in Wuhan, China, who attempted to warn his country about it. That authorities in Beijing initially tried to silence him raises questions about China's claim that it has quickly contained the disease's spread. Transparency isn't one of the Communist Party's strengths.

Yet business investment in the U.S. was already trending down before the virus hit, and we're overdue for a recession. Even the pandemic doesn't explain the severity of the stock-market downdraft last week. Yes, there is the madness of crowds, but that too is an unsatisfying narrative. Something else is going on.

That something is fear about U.S. financial-system stability. The immediate concern for central banks is a liquidity squeeze that paralyzes lending and brings down healthy institutions. Walter Bagehot's sage advice in his 1873 book, ""Lombard Street,"" was that to avoid panics, central banks, as lenders of last resort, need to make liquidity freely available to solvent institutions, but at a premium.

On Thursday the Federal Reserve announced $1.5 trillion in short-term funding to keep financial markets from seizing up, though there's no penalty rate. A shortage of dollars in Asia last week hit Japanese and Korean bonds. Access to swap lines should alleviate some of that pressure, and Mexico's central bank also has swap privileges at the Fed. Other central banks in the region don't, and they will feel the pinch.

A greater concern is whether the U.S. financial system is facing a solvency crisis, i.e., too many loans going bad and pulling one or more banks under. The Fed doesn't reassure with its announcement Sunday that it will not only cut its benchmark interest rate to near zero but also buy $700 billion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities.

The purchases are ostensibly to ensure ""the flow of credit."" But this ""quantitative easing"" was last seen after the 2008 financial crisis, when poorly managed financial institutions were desperate to avoid insolvency and repair their balance sheets.

The worry that banks might be in trouble again is reflected in markets. Bank stocks rallied Friday after the Fed promised to intervene, but bank equity prices were diving more than the broad indexes most of the week. On Wednesday the Journal reported that ""the cost of insuring against default on Citigroup debt for five years rose to $115,000 annually from $40,000 this week, according to FactSet."" The price remained ""well below the panicked pricing seen in 2008,"" but the surge indicated something amiss.

The benign explanation is an expectation that bank profits will underperform as interest rates swoon. But the quality of loan portfolios is also a consideration. So is the adequacy of the stress testing banks have faced since the last crisis.

In an April 2013 speech in Basel, Switzerland, Thomas Hoenig, then vice chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., warned deposit insurers that the practice of risk-weighting assets was creating an ""illusion that banking organizations have adequate capital to absorb unexpected losses."" If that's true it would go a long way in explaining fear about banks' exposure to this downturn. There are also the uncertainties of the humongous and nontransparent interest-rate swap market, where major banks are counterparties to each other.

If the financial system is still shaky after a decade of Fed subsidies, it implies that absurdly low interest rates and quantitative easing have been counterproductive. Grandma has been eating cat food while the banks remain fragile. This is bad for those of us who prefer liberty to socialism.

Former Salvadoran Finance Minister Manuel Hinds writes in his forthcoming book, ""Our 1776 Moment: A Defense of Liberal Democracy,"" that the damage from the bailout in 2008 went ""much beyond economic losses. The crisis and its solution destroyed the faith that people had put in capitalism and liberal democracy."" Enter Bernie Sanders.

The U.S. may yet fight off a lurch to the left. But the ripple effect in Latin America, where collectivists perpetually rail against markets, is worrisome.

World News: U.S. Mulls Troop Cuts Amid Terror Threats

NOUAKCHOTT, Mauritania -- At the closing ceremony of U.S.-led military exercises in this expansive Saharan nation, American diplomat R. Clarke Cooper stepped to the podium and assured African military commanders that Washington stands ready to help them in their time of need.

""The U.S. has an unwavering and longstanding commitment to Africa,"" Mr. Cooper, the State Department's assistant secretary for political-military affairs, said late last month.

In fact, U.S. allies are increasingly worried that America's commitment may be wavering when wide swaths of Africa face a surging threat from militants affiliated with al Qaeda and Islamic State.

U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper is conducting a world-wide review of troop commitments, in keeping with the Trump administration's strategic tilt away from dispersed actions against terror groups and toward great-power competition with China and Russia.

Africa is the first region on Mr. Esper's list, and military officers and lawmakers expect him to order fresh troop reductions on the continent, on top of the 17% cut in personnel over the past two years. The Pentagon hasn't said when he will announce his decision.

The Pentagon has already sliced some 1,200 personnel from its rolls in Africa since deployments there hit a peak in 2018. It now has 6,000 troops and civilians concentrated in Niger in the west and in Somalia and Djibouti in the east. Instead of combat power, the U.S. offers specialized support for those doing the fighting.

Africa's security situation is especially serious in the middle of the Sahel, the semiarid belt between the Sahara to the north and more tropical lands to the south. The number of extremist attacks in the Sahelian heartland -- Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali, across the border from Mauritania -- is doubling annually, to 803 last year from 55 in 2015, according to Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project figures assembled by the Pentagon's Africa Center for Strategic Studies. More than 4,000 civilians and African soldiers died in attacks in the three countries last year, up from 770 in 2016, the United Nations reported.

A sequence of attacks against military and civilian targets has sent more than one million people fleeing south in Burkina Faso alone in recent months, creating what aid agencies are calling the world's fastest-growing refugee crisis.

France, which colonized much of the Sahel, leads the West's military response to the crisis. Paris has 4,500 troops stationed in West Africa and is adding 600 reinforcements.

France is contributing hundreds of troops to a major offensive by some 5,000 West African soldiers where the borders of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger come together and where militants maneuver freely among isolated villages, according to African officers. The French Ministry of Defense declined to comment.

U.S. troops don't conduct unilateral counterterrorism raids or airstrikes in West Africa, unlike in Somalia, where they carry out frequent air attacks on al-Shabaab militants. In 2017, four U.S. servicemen and five Nigerien soldiers were killed when their patrol was ambushed by fighters from the Islamic State of the Greater Sahara. The U.S. military subsequently barred its troops from accompanying West African forces on such operations.

U.S. support includes aerial refueling for warplanes, air transport for troops and supplies, and airborne surveillance by drones at a new, $110 million U.S.-built base in Agadez, Niger. U.S. Green Beret teams are stationed in Niger to mentor elite local units, and American commandos periodically visit Burkina Faso to train its forces, according to officers from those countries.

The U.S. won't say publicly whether it is providing intelligence or other assistance in the new offensive, which is targeting Islamic State of the Greater Sahara and a collection of al Qaeda affiliates operating as Jama'at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin, or JNIM. The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency estimates JNIM's strength at 1,000 to 2,000 fighters.

""You don't want your boys at the front? Give us training with the Special Forces,"" said Maman Sidikou, permanent secretary of the G5 Sahel, a grouping of five West African countries, which is fielding the African battalions for the operation.

U.S. Africa Command is already pulling back from a strategy of trying to ""degrade"" extremist groups to simply attempting to ""contain"" them, according to a report to Congress last month by a Pentagon inspector general.

The U.S. is pressing its European allies, who also train regional military and police forces, to fill whatever gaps it may leave. ""It is about expanding that burden-sharing,"" Mr. Cooper told reporters.

During a visit to Washington in January, France's defense minister, Florence Parly, stood next to Mr. Esper as she told reporters that a reduction in U.S. support would ""severely limit"" the effectiveness of French operations in the Sahel.

U.S. officials tried to calm nerves among the Africans gathered for the exercises in Mauritania. ""A posture review doesn't always equate with absence or reduction"" of forces, Mr. Cooper said in an interview.

Brig. Gen. Dagvin Anderson, commander of U.S. special-operations forces in Africa, said he told his African counterparts that the U.S. isn't pulling up stakes completely. ""A small footprint can have a large impact,"" he said in an interview.

Still, the possibility of a drawdown has sparked a rare show of bipartisanship in Congress.

""Any reduction in U.S. military presence in West Africa would have real and lasting negative consequences for our African partners,"" Sen. Jim Inhofe (R., Okla.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said after leading a congressional delegation to Mauritania last month.

Sen. Inhofe is among the lawmakers and counterterrorism officials warning that a U.S. pullback could also provide an opportunity for China and Russia to expand their influence in Africa, the very phenomenon the administration says it is trying to prevent in its global reshuffling of forces.

Nigerien officials are desperate for Americans to deepen their involvement instead of stepping back. Nigerien commanders would like U.S. Green Berets to resume joint patrols with their men. And Niger's government would welcome U.S. airstrikes against militants inside the country, said a senior Nigerien official. ""They can kill anyone they'd like,"" the official said, not entirely joking.

Business News: Airbus Copter Deals Scrutinized

Airbus SE executives raised concerns about fees paid to a number of middlemen working with its helicopter division, led at the time by the company's current chief executive, according to internal documents related to Airbus's $4 billion bribery settlement in January.

In that settlement, U.S., U.K, and French prosecutors alleged Airbus inappropriately paid middlemen to secure orders at its commercial-aviation and its defense and space units. Internal documents submitted to investigators in the probe and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal show Airbus executives raised red flags about payments to middlemen at the helicopter unit.

The division at the time of the internal scrutiny was headed by Guillaume Faury, who took over last year as Airbus's group chief executive. Suspect helicopter deals were flagged for various reasons, according to the documents.

Some middlemen payments appeared to executives as excessive compared with the underlying helicopter orders involved, according to the documents. Others were flagged, according to the documents, for what executives suspected was improper due diligence or lack of supporting paperwork. Airbus executives made no final determinations about the propriety of the helicopter deals in the documents viewed by the Journal.

Mr. Faury, who headed the helicopter unit from 2013 to 2018, declined to comment.

Airbus, citing ""legal reasons,"" said it couldn't comment on specific cases covered by the investigation.

Mr. Faury is one of a handful of senior executives who have remained on Airbus's executive committee in the wake of the bribery investigation that led to the biggest-ever international settlement of corporate bribery charges.

Britain's Serious Fraud Office, the agency that led the investigation for the U.K., found that none of Airbus's current board, including Mr. Faury, was implicated in any of the allegations they made public as part of the settlement. The SFO said it ""has no evidence that the current Executive Committee members knew of the corrupt practices or culture of Airbus.""

The documents, which haven't been made public and haven't previously been reported, include minutes of meetings by Airbus executives tasked with reviewing how to exit contracts with middlemen that might have fallen afoul of global bribery and corruption rules.

Overall, about 110 partnerships with third-party agents working for Airbus's various units were flagged by executives as suspicious in the internal review, which was then used to help prosecutors in their outside probes. British and French prosecutors brought forward 13 counts against the company related to those deals. None of them was related to helicopter sales.

Prosecutors have said publicly they narrowed the scope of their probe to concentrate on the biggest deals with the clearest evidence of alleged wrongdoing. They have said they are now probing the actions of individuals, after settling with Airbus.

The settlement with prosecutors included a deferred prosecution agreement, in which Airbus wasn't required to admit or deny specific wrongdoing. Prosecutors said they won't investigate any further deals that have been disclosed by Airbus. Those would include the helicopter deals discussed in the internal documents.

Airbus first conducted an internal review into the full extent of its third-party relationships in late 2013, according to prosecutors. An Airbus audit found ""significant breaches of compliance policies"" in Airbus's relationship with its third-party agents, they said. It reported the issues to investigators and the company has cooperated in the various probes.

Airbus decided to freeze all payments outstanding for deals in its commercial aircraft division, which accounts for the lion's share of its overall revenue. That freeze later extended to its other divisions, defense and space, and helicopters.

After its internal audit, Airbus set up what executives termed the ""liquidation committee,"" in an effort to unwind relationships with scores of agents it was using around the world, prosecutors have said.

Payments to middlemen in Thailand and South Korea related to helicopter sales were deemed as excessive by the committee, while the level of remuneration for its agent in China was ordered to be reviewed, according to minutes of the committee's deliberations, reviewed by the Journal.

The committee asked for due diligence of its agents in Japan and Indonesia to be checked and updated, according to the minutes. All proposed contracts in Brazil were put on hold, while contracts in Argentina were initially allowed to proceed under new compliance rules that were stricter and limited the amount payable to the local agent.

The committee was tasked with deciding how to deal with suspect contracts, whether by continuing to honor them, through settlements or by refusing to pay. The decisions were based in part on whether the amount of money promised to the agents was justifiable, according to the documents.

Heard on the Street
Fed Can Probably Handle Hit To Markets --- It seems willing to do what is necessary

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

The coronavirus is putting the financial system that emerged from last decade's banking crisis to the test. Initially, markets appeared to pass. Over the past few days, they have started to buckle.

The good news is that the Federal Reserve learned a lot during the 2008 crisis. If it doesn't renege on its unofficial role as the world's market maker, it should be in a position to fix most problems.

On Sunday, the Fed surprised the market by slashing rates to zero and agreeing to buy $700 billion in Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities. This follows Friday's smaller commitment and a $1.5 trillion liquidity injection unveiled Thursday.

These are necessary steps after a turbulent week in which fund values have shown signs of dislocating from the value of the assets they own, an uncomfortable echo of 2008. Even the market for U.S. government bonds, the safest and most liquid in the world, is under pressure. Over recent trading sessions, Treasury yields have bounced back -- an oddity in times of panic. Relative to derivatives markets in which investors bet on future interest rates, Treasurys are trading at their steepest discount since the global financial crisis.

Before panicking, though, investors should recall that the Fed has what it takes to mend the market plumbing. Its latest actions should at least ease any potential concern about Treasurys -- an essential haven asset for the entire world -- being safe. It confirms that, ultimately, sovereign debt is always backed by the central bank.

Another concern last week, particularly in global markets, was dollar scarcity. On Thursday, spreads on euro and yen cross-currency basis swaps -- an instrument often used by companies outside the U.S. to borrow greenbacks in exchange for their own currencies -- jumped to levels reminiscent of the 2011 euro crisis, during which international lenders scrambled to source dollars.

Over the past decade, investors repeatedly warned about new regulations clogging the arteries of the financial system. Banks are safer, but face higher costs for expanding their balance sheets and must hold more liquid assets. This is supposed to prevent a scenario like the fall of 2008, when they had to sell in a panic and drove markets into a collapse.

The flip side is banks can no longer handle all the securities that fund managers are eager to trade -- a problem that may have extended to Treasurys. Nor can they extend short-term loans as freely, constraining the supply of dollars.

The Fed is mulling an easing of bank liquidity rules and its actions over recent days could help ease the problem of dollar scarcity if U.S. banks lend it abroad. If not, the Fed now has ""swap lines"" with its established peers abroad. This system, established after the last crisis, means the U.S. can easily provide dollars to Western countries that need them.

Over the past few years, central banks bought a lot of corporate paper through quantitative-easing programs. This has had little effect on the economy, but is a key tool to ensure market liquidity that the Fed could deploy. Emergency facilities tested out in 2008 could also make a comeback.

This doesn't mean that all market distortions can be fixed. For one, the brutality of the recent rout was likely exacerbated by the large number of traders betting against volatility in the preceding months. And when it comes to the economic impact of Covid-19, monetary policy can do very little.

But investors should take solace from these early signs that -- perhaps unlike the European Central Bank -- the Fed seems committed to ensuring the smooth functioning of markets. When it comes to market liquidity, a virus cannot win a fight with the U.S. central bank.

Golden Gates

By Conor Dougherty

(Penguin Press, 269 pages, $28)

The Yes in My Backyard (Yimby) Act, introduced by Reps. Trey Hollingsworth (R., Ind.) and Denny Heck (D., Wash.), recently passed the House of Representatives. The bill requires cities seeking community-development funds from the federal government to report their progress in removing local regulatory obstacles, such as restrictive zoning rules or onerous permitting processes, that hamper housing affordability by limiting new construction.

The term ""Yimby"" in the bill's title is a play on Nimby, or ""not in my backyard,"" the moniker given to a person who, while not necessarily opposed to new housing, strongly opposes development in his own neighborhood. A Yimby, by contrast, is much more likely to offer unconditional support for new housing, wherever it might go.

The Yimby Act aims to prod expensive cities and suburbs into accommodating more affordable housing. And though it won't unleash a flood of pro-housing reform, the information the bill aims to collect will help the federal government better understand the problem. It also signals a growing bipartisan consensus that regulatory burdens in local housing markets are a source of regional and national impediments to economic growth and upward mobility.

To wit, the housing plans advanced by a number of this year's Democratic presidential candidates included policies to loosen local housing regulations. In June, President Trump signed an executive order to create the White House Council on Eliminating Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing. State legislatures from Texas to California, North Carolina to Oregon are advancing bipartisan bills to alleviate regulatory burdens on housing growth. It is a sign of the deep dysfunction in local housing markets that the tedious details of local zoning codes are now the subject of scrutiny from state and federal lawmakers.

Those wishing to understand how we got here would do well to start with California, where the crisis of housing affordability is most acute. And for a compelling and accessible overview of the state's housing crisis, there is no better book than Conor Dougherty's ""Golden Gates: Fighting for Housing in America.""

Mr. Dougherty, a reporter at the New York Times and, formerly, The Wall Street Journal, has a gift for telling the stories of people struggling to overcome California's housing dysfunction: the teenager fighting a rent increase that would displace her family; the three brothers who share one room in a house that is already home to seven other people; the enterprising builder who assumes massive regulatory risk to experiment with modular housing; the Catholic nun who tangles with real-estate investors to buy up apartment buildings and deed-restrict them as forever affordable. Absorbed in these narratives, the reader hardly realizes he is receiving an education on the political economy of California's housing market.

California is home to four of the five most expensive metropolitan areas in the country. In relatively affordable Raleigh, N.C., the ratio of the median house price to the median income in 2019 was 3.8. In Los Angeles, that ratio was 9. And for a state that desperately needs housing, California is bad at building it: In 2018 it ranked 32nd among states on new-housing permits per capita. The San Francisco Bay Area, the focus of much of Mr. Dougherty's book, built one unit of housing for every 5.4 jobs added between 2011 and 2017.

Early in his book, Mr. Dougherty recounts how Larry Katz, now a labor economist at Harvard, sounded the alarm over California's housing market in a 1981 valedictory speech to the University of California, Berkeley. During the 1970s, Bay Area housing prices had gone from not much more than the national median to exceeding it by more than 50%. Mr. Katz observed that the demand for housing alone could not explain deteriorating affordability. After all, California experienced even stronger demand in the 1950s and '60s without a similar price surge.

But in the 1970s the antidevelopment sentiments of existing homeowners, often masked by a facade of limits-to-growth environmentalism, began to harden. Coupled with the passage in 1978 of Proposition 13, which strictly limited the property-tax burden on appreciating home values, the homeowners whose voices and votes shaped local policy began to block more and more proposals for new housing. As Mr. Katz put it at the time: ""I believe, regrettably, that this will require some sort of state or federal action.""

Decades later, Sonja Trauss, a high-school math teacher in Oakland, ignited a movement that created precisely the sort of action Mr. Katz's speech envisaged. In 2014, convinced that the only way out of the Bay Area's housing crisis was an abundance of housing, Ms. Trauss began attending public hearings in San Francisco -- a center of hostility to development -- and speaking up in favor of new housing proposals. California's Yimby movement was born, evolving rapidly from comments at public hearings to litigation against exclusionary suburbs to electing a champion of affordable housing, Scott Wiener, to the state legislature.

The trademark policy of California's Yimby movement, Mr. Wiener's Senate Bill 50, would have pre-empted local zoning rules statewide, allowing for higher-density housing development near transit and job centers. In January, as Mr. Dougherty's book was going to press, SB 50 fell three votes short in Sacramento. This setback notwithstanding, Mr. Dougherty's account makes it clear that the California Yimbys are only getting started. Barely one month after the defeat of his signature bill, Mr. Wiener introduced SB 902, a bill in the mold of SB 50 that proposes more moderate density allowances than its predecessor.

With the Yimby Act making its way through Congress and a number of states advancing pro-housing legislation to head off nascent affordability crises of their own, the fight to roll back restrictive land-use regulations in America's cities is far from over.

Cuba Is an Academic Fraud

Bernie Sanders has spent decades preparing to lose the Florida primary. In a 1985 interview, Vermont's self-described socialist said of Fidel Castro that ""he educated their kids."" He still praises the Communist regime's ""massive literacy program.""

Mr. Sanders is not alone in his admiration for Cuban education. In 2016 President Obama quoted himself as telling Raul Castro, Fidel's younger brother and successor: ""You've made great progress in educating young people. Every child in Cuba gets a basic education."" Dan Domenech, executive director of the American Association of School Administrators, visited Havana in 2017 and exulted: ""Cuba's education system might as well be considered the ultimate wrap-around institution for children."" In 2007 Stanford's Martin Carnoy published a book called ""Cuba's Academic Advantage.""

It's all bunk -- though it's hard to prove, because Cuba refuses to participate in international tests such as the respected Program for International Student Assessment. The only external tests in which Cuba did participate were the 1997 and 2006 waves of the Latin American Laboratory for Assessment of the Quality of Education, sponsored by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and nicknamed Laboratorio. This was the main evidentiary basis for Mr. Carnoy's book.

But the Cuban government supervised the administration of the Laboratorio tests, and the results strongly suggest it cheated. The median language-arts score for Cuban third-graders in 1997 was 343 points, compared with 264 in Argentina, 256 in Brazil and 229 in Mexico. If these scores are to be believed, the median child in Cuba learns by grade three what equivalent students elsewhere don't learn until at least grade six.

In math, median Cuban third- and sixth-grade students scored 1.5 standard deviations higher than Chileans in 2006. (A standard deviation is about two years' worth of learning.) Is Cuba a standout within Latin America, even though it won't subject itself to comparison with developed countries? That seems unlikely. Chile performed only 0.9 standard deviation lower than high-flying Finland on the Program for International Student Assessment's 2018 math test.

Belying Cuban students' sky-high scores, they don't seem to learn much from one grade to the next. In Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico, fourth-graders scored 22 to 25 points higher than third-graders on the 1997 math test. In Cuba an additional year of schooling was good for only five points. Why? One possibility is that teachers corrected the answers so that many students in both grades received perfect or near-perfect scores.

Similarly suspicious is the narrow gap -- only 0.05 standard deviation -- between urban and rural schools in Cuba. In Mexico and Brazil urban schools do better by 0.62 and 0.66 standard deviations, respectively.

It's unsurprising that a communist regime would falsify its own accomplishments. It's dismaying that American politicians, educators and scholars would fall for it.

U.S. News -- Capital Account: Don't Look to the Fed. It's Others' Turn Now

The Federal Reserve is now officially spent. Saving the U.S. economy from this point forward is now up to others.

On Sunday, the Fed used the last of its conventional monetary ammunition to counter the economic crisis triggered by the new coronavirus. It cut its short-term interest-rate target a full percentage point to between 0% and 0.25%.

The Fed has been here before, from 2008 to 2015. This time, the prospect of an escape from zero seems more uncertain, because the near-term economic shock of the pandemic adds to deeper seated forces pressing down on inflation and interest rates globally. With this cut the Fed joins the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, whose policy rates have long been at or below zero. This is what Harvard University economist Lawrence Summers has called the ""monetary black hole.""

""The pandemic mechanism is unexpected but it's been clear for years that some negative shock would bring us to the liquidity trap,"" Mr. Summers said in an email. With 10-year Treasury note yields below 0.8%, ""there is virtually no juice left in monetary policy,"" which he said explains why markets sold off after the previous emergency half-percentage-point rate cut and after Sunday's cut.

Some critics will say the Fed should have conserved some ammo for later, but its officials have always maintained they should cut rates when the economy needs it. The rate cuts won't halt the pandemic or reopen restaurants, but they will, at the margin, help.

The Fed has some other options in its tool kit. It can buy assets, lend to banks, and alter supervisory guidance -- all part of its original mission to keep the financial system operating. These can't avert economic crisis, but they can keep it from becoming a financial crisis. Unlike in 2008, no big banks or other institutions appear to be in danger of collapse. But as in 2008, the securities markets have come under strain, which can prevent the Fed's interest-rate cuts from reaching the real economy.

Soaring volatility has saddled investors with losses, forcing them to sell Treasury bonds. As a result yields went up last week when they should have gone down, and trading in mortgage-backed securities dried up, threatening the supply of credit to housing. After failing to ease those pressures with interventions last week, the Fed on Sunday promised to buy $500 billion of Treasurys and $200 billion of mortgage-backed securities. That helped pull Treasury yields down Monday though other markets remained strained.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said this wasn't ""quantitative easing,"" the bond buying the Fed conducted from 2008 to 2014, because its purpose was to restore market functioning, not push yields lower. The distinction is somewhat academic since the point of both is to keep yields low.

The Fed also cut the rate on direct loans from its discount window to banks by 1.5 percentage points and extended the term to up to 90 days, to help banks ""meet demands for credit from households and businesses."" The Fed, as a supervisor, is also encouraging banks to lend more without worrying about their capital buffers, which are above regulatory minimums. This may help, but the bigger constraint on banks is that some of their customers may go out of business because of the pandemic.

Mr. Powell said the Fed still has tools to help the economy, but that is putting on a brave face on a somewhat bleaker reality. The Fed has ruled out cutting rates below zero, as the ECB and BOJ have done. To nudge bond yields lower it can promise to keep rates at zero and buy more bonds, but with yields already so low, the benefit is likely to be slight.

The economy's fate is now in the hands of medical professionals and fiscal policy. On that, the Fed has helped by enabling the federal government to borrow all it wants at rock-bottom interest rates. Beyond that, Mr. Powell can push from the sidelines, which he did somewhat more Sunday than he has before. The House of Representatives and the White House already have agreed on a package of targeted fiscal measures, and more including industry-specific bailouts may follow.

Forecasting how long rates stay at zero is complicated by the extraordinary uncertainty around the course of the pandemic and the breadth and duration of ""social-distancing"" measures.

A positive scenario is a sharp but short hit to the economy. Broad swaths of activity come to a halt for a month or two, which succeeds in holding new cases to a level hospitals can manage. Restrictions on activity end and pent-up demand, goosed by fiscal and monetary stimulus, produces a V-shaped recovery.

The labor market is much stronger now than when rates last hit zero in 2008, and isn't burdened with hundreds of billions of dollars of impaired debt. Goldman Sachs sees the economy shrinking 5%, annualized, in the second quarter, then growing 3% in the third and 4% in the fourth. That would probably show ""the economy has weathered recent events,"" Mr. Powell's stated test for reversing the rate cuts. That said, it would be politically difficult to do so before November's election.

A more pessimistic scenario is a more drawn-out pandemic, and a weaker U-shaped economic recovery, compounded by depleted stock wealth and global conflict over trade and travel. Inflation is already below the Fed's 2% target and will likely go lower because of the pandemic and an oil-price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia. In such circumstances, the Fed, like the ECB and the BOJ, will struggle to justify any rate increase. ""We are likely talking years before we see a rate hike again,"" Roberto Perli, an analyst at Cornerstone Macro, wrote to clients Sunday.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Hobbled, Africa and Latin America Brace for Outbreaks

The coronavirus has overwhelmed health-care systems in a number of highly developed nations. Now, it is spreading to some of the world's most vulnerable countries, with health officials in Africa and Latin America fearing the impact will be devastating.

At least 26 of Africa's 54 countries have confirmed cases. The prospect of a mass outbreak is particularly alarming for a region with a shortage of some 1.8 million health workers that is already suffering the world's largest disease burden, according to the World Health Organization. In 2018, an estimated 470,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa died from AIDS-related causes alone, according to the United Nations.

Sudan is among more than a dozen African nations that lacked capacity to test for the virus until early March, according to WHO. Its first case was only identified on Friday, a day after the victim, a man in his 50s, died after returning from the United Arab Emirates, Sudan's health ministry said.

In West Africa, Guinea has been beset by months of violent protests by the political opposition, upending the government's ability to provide services. There, the first case of coronavirus was detected Thursday after a European Union employee who had arrived asked to be tested.

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed the nation Sunday, calling the pandemic a national emergency and saying his government was working on an economic rescue package to limit the ""severe disruption"" to the economy. South Africa has 61 confirmed cases.

Africa is the world's second most-populous continent and accounts for 16% of the global population -- but just 1% of health-care spending.

""Africa, especially sub-Saharan Africa, is ill-equipped and unprepared to manage outbreaks of the magnitude like coronavirus,"" said Dr. Chris Kaganda, a Ugandan health specialist. ""There is insufficient equipment for early detection of the disease, inadequate personnel with the appropriate knowledge and skills to treat patients infected with coronavirus.""

Latin America and the Caribbean, a richer region with many middle-income countries, has strong health care in a number of places. Colombia will require people arriving to the country to go into a two-week quarantine. Peru and Argentina on Sunday sealed off their borders. Peru also restricted movement within the country, allowing only essential services like supermarkets, banks and pharmacies to remain open.

Yet weak health-care systems abound in countries as varied as Haiti, which recently reported its first case, to Guyana on South America's eastern shoulder to Honduras in Central America, which is hard hit by drug trafficking.

Honduras is particularly hamstrung by corruption, which costs some $2 billion a year,equivalent to about 10% of gross domestic product, said Ismael Zepeda, an economist at Fosdeh, a think tank. That undercuts already decaying public services, experts say.

Few countries are as poorly prepared to handle an onslaught of cases as Venezuela, which reported its first two cases Friday and 15 more over the weekend. The government has banned flights from Europe and Colombia, and ordered businesses to close and people to remain at home in six states and the capital. Doctors and epidemiologists have been warning for years about the inability of the health system to fight epidemics, including dengue, yellow fever and malaria.

""We either go into quarantine or the pandemic could brutally and tragically bring down our country,"" Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro said Sunday.

Hospitals have lost thousands of highly trained doctors and nurses who have fled abroad, part of an exodus of some 4.5 million migrants fleeing an authoritarian regime. Many hospitals lack power, often being plunged into darkness during blackouts that force surgeons to finish operations using the light on their cellphones. About 90% of hospitals reported having intermittent or no running water last year, while half of emergency rooms aren't equipped with face masks, according to a national survey of Venezuela's biggest hospitals conducted by a network of health professionals.

""Whatever the impact is going to be in other countries, it is going to be bigger in Venezuela,"" said Dr. Julio Castro, an infectious disease specialist in Caracas who saw patients with symptoms of the coronavirus.

Malnutrition Leaves

Venezuela Exposed

Adding to the challenge of combating the coronavirus in Venezuela is widespread malnutrition among the people, causing weaker immune systems in those who struggle to get enough to eat due to soaring inflation and shortages of goods.

On a recent day, doctors and nurses at Caracas's University Hospital gathered for a presentation on how they should prepare for the coronavirus were reminded to washtheir hands with running water, a luxury in one of the biggest hospitals, which stores water in plastic bins.

""Every single aspect of the health crisis in Venezuela will become an accelerator, creating a severe outcome,"" said Irene Bosch, a scientist who has studied infectious diseases in Venezuela with the U.S. National Institutes of Health. ""You are supposed to wash your hands 10 times a day. Who has water in Caracas to do that?""

World News: Israel's Gantz Moves to Assemble Coalition

TEL AVIV -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is facing a tougher fight for his political survival after the president formally asked former military chief Benny Gantz to try to form a new government, multiplying Mr. Netanyahu's problems as he prepares to defend himself against corruption charges.

President Reuven Rivlin's decision, made official Monday, follows another inconclusive election this month, the third in the space of a year. Four weeks of political maneuvering will now begin in which Mr. Gantz will try to stitch together a broad enough coalition from disparate parties to turn voter fatigue with Mr. Netanyahu into a government.

Mr. Gantz has more leverage this time than after the previous elections: His backers have more seats -- 61 -- in the Israeli parliament, the 120-member Knesset.

""I will make every effort to establish within days as broad a national and patriotic government as possible to serve all the citizens of Israel,"" Mr. Gantz said Monday.

Mr. Netanyahu's bloc of 58 lawmakers, comprising right-wing religious parties and his Likud party, sent a letter Monday to the heads of Mr. Gantz's Blue and White party and the left-wing parties backing him, offering two other options to form a government: A national unity administration with Mr. Netanyahu serving as premier for two years and then Mr. Gantz serving for the next two years, or an emergency government led by Mr. Netanyahu that would last six months before Mr. Gantz attempts to form a government.

Mr. Netanyahu's corruption trial, due to begin Tuesday, was delayed until May as part of the emergency measures. Mr. Netanyahu is being tried on bribery, fraud and breach-of-trust charges connected to allegations that he gave official favors to media moguls and businessmen in exchange for gifts and positive press coverage. He denies wrongdoing.

Mr. Gantz said little to indicate how he will try to form a government, other than that he has always wanted a united government. After receiving the mandate to try to form a government, Mr. Gantz invited each party leader in the right-wing bloc to meet and they all refused, their spokespeople said.

To become premier, Mr. Gantz will have to find sufficient common ground among the competing political parties that have vaulted him ahead of the embattled Mr. Netanyahu. He has four weeks to form a government. While the law allows for a two-week extension, he is unlikely to be granted one after so many elections.

Mr. Gantz's clearest options: form a minority government that includes his party, an alliance of left-wing parties and possibly Avigdor Lieberman's Yisrael Beitenu party and rely on outside support from 15 lawmakers from the Joint List, a group of Israeli Arab parties; or reach an accord with Likud in which Mr. Netanyahu would serve as prime minister for a reduced period. Mr. Gantz doesn't currently have enough support within his bloc for the first option, because Mr. Lieberman and some Blue and White lawmakers oppose an arrangement that requires the support of the Arab parties.

""Netanyahu is facing the most serious threat to his power for the past 20 years. . . . He really has to be careful and make sure that he gets a good deal,"" said Emmanuel Navon, senior fellow at the Jerusalem-based Kohelet Policy Forum.

U.S. News: Biden Reveals Leftward Tilt Of His Party

WASHINGTON -- Joe Biden's emergence as the 2020 Democratic presidential front-runner is widely cast as a victory for moderates over progressives. But the former vice president's platform also shows how far left the party's center on economic policy has moved in recent years.

On taxes, health care, climate change and labor rights, Mr. Biden proposes a significantly bigger government role than Hillary Clinton did during her 2016 presidential bid and what the Obama-Biden ticket advocated during their two White House campaigns.

Ideological gaps still divide Democrats, as highlighted by the lingering primary contest between Mr. Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, his chief remaining rival. Mr. Sanders's sweeping plans carry a total 10-year price tag of about $50 trillion -- more than eight times Mr. Biden's agenda.

Still, Mr. Biden proposes tax and spending increases equivalent to 1.5% of U.S. gross domestic product, more than double the level Mrs. Clinton advocated four years ago and higher than the budget blueprints from the end of President Obama's term, according to a recent study by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.

""What's being called moderate now would have been the far left eight years ago,"" says Matthew Chingos, an education expert at the Urban Institute, a Washington-based think tank.

Mr. Biden's proposals fall well short of the debt cancellation and four-year tuition-free college plans of Mr. Sanders and former candidate Elizabeth Warren. But ""the levels of new federal spending for education proposed by the Biden campaign are well above what Democratic candidates proposed four, eight, or 12 years ago,"" Mr. Chingos adds, citing Mr. Biden's plans to double college Pell grants for low-income students and triple funding for low-income public schools.

On Sunday, in a bid to win over voters favoring Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts senator, the Biden campaign said he was endorsing two policies similar to ones those candidates have advocated. He sweetened his higher-education plan to make four-year public colleges tuition free for some families -- albeit only those making less than $125,000 a year. And Mr. Biden vowed to make it easier for Americans to file for bankruptcy protection from creditors, softening a position he had taken as a senator to toughen the process.

""Sen. Sanders and I both agree. . .health care should be a right, not a privilege,"" Mr. Biden said in the Sunday night debate between the two men. ""We disagree on the detail of how we do it, but we don't disagree on the principle.""

President Trump is making the Democrats' leftward shift a theme of his re-election effort. ""There will be no 'moderate' Democrat on the ballot in 2020,"" his campaign said in a statement issued after Mr. Biden's early March resurgence.

Rather than denying the charge of liberalism, some Biden aides embrace it. ""The vice president is proposing the most progressive agenda since the Great Society,"" says Stef Feldman, the campaign policy director, asserting that many of his proposals ""are dramatically to the left of traditional Democratic policy platforms.""

Health care illustrates the party's shift. Mr. Biden's plan, to make Medicare available to any American who wants it, costs a fraction of Mr. Sanders's ""Medicare for All"" program replacing all private insurance.

But the Biden proposal is more ambitious than Mrs. Clinton's 2016 health plan. His would cost the government as much as $1.3 trillion, net, over 10 years, compared with $250 billion for hers, according to analyses by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

On climate change, Mr. Biden, along with most of the two dozen Democrats who ran for president this cycle, has called for eliminating carbon emissions by 2050, compared with the 80% reduction that was the party consensus four years ago.

Mr. Biden's open touting of tax increases is also ""a reflection of changing times,"" said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.

In part, Mr. Biden and other Democrats see raising taxes now as mainly undoing Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts.

But Mr. Biden is also venturing beyond recent Democratic tax plans, calculating that voter concern with inequality makes taxing the rich more politically palatable.

Global View
China's Coronavirus Opportunity

As bodies are thrown into mass graves in Iran, as Italian doctors practice triage in overcrowded wards, as borders close across Europe and American cities shut down, it is hard to look past the tumult and distress of each passing day.

The full political impact of the new coronavirus, a Jet Age pandemic that is spreading through a highly integrated global economy with shattering speed, isn't yet known, and much depends on how successful efforts to mitigate its damage and find treatments and ultimately a vaccine for it will be. But on its present trajectory, the pandemic seems likely to test the international political system to an extent that few living people remember. In an ironic twist, an epidemic that started in China may end by increasing Beijing's international reach.

The pandemic has already widened the breach and sharpened the competition between the U.S. and China. While, as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told me over the weekend, the U.S. has provided medical assistance to China, and while cooperation between medical and technical personnel in the two countries continues, China has used the pandemic to launch a massive propaganda and disinformation campaign -- alleging, among other claims, that Americans brought the virus to China. Despite President Trump's efforts to keep open lines of communication to President Xi Jinping, relations between the two countries are as difficult as at any time since the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989.

At first glance, the pandemic illustrates the perils of too heavy a dependence on Chinese investment and trade. As China struggles to restart its economy, disruptions in global supply chains will bring new challenges to firms around the world. In both Italy and Iran, the epidemic surged first in places with large concentrations of Chinese merchants and traders. Yet as Ian Bremmer of Eurasia Group warns, the balance may tip back in China's favor if Beijing remains focused on its global agenda and Western governments focus exclusively on their domestic concerns.

So far, with the exception of Iran, the most severe outbreaks outside China have been in wealthy countries with well-developed political and medical systems. But the greatest impact of the pandemic will likely come in less-developed countries. On top of an epidemic with which their sometimes underfunded medical systems can't cope, many countries will face a catastrophic mix of capital flight, falling commodity prices, supply-chain disruptions, slack demand for manufactured goods in a global recession, and the implosion of the tourism industry. In separate interviews, Messrs. Pompeo and Bremmer emphasized the potential consequences of the crisis on already stressed societies, with Mr. Pompeo pointing in particular to the devastating effects of the oil-price collapse for exporters in Africa and Latin America.

In the Americas, an epidemic and low oil prices will put enormous pressure on Venezuela. Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador may send new streams of migrants north as the impact of the epidemic throws those economies into a deep recession.

The massive epidemic in Iran will almost certainly spill over into war-torn Syria and Iraq, and to a Lebanon struggling to accommodate Syrian refugees amid its worst financial crisis in decades. Turkey, whose economy was already hurting before the world-wide market meltdown, is currently home to millions of refugees from Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. A deep recession in Turkey coupled with an epidemic would test President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's grip on power even as streams of desperate refugees try to enter from Syria. With the U.S. looking to reduce its engagement in the region, and Europe focused on its own problems, both Russia and China will be tempted to increase their influence in a strategic part of the world.

The African outlook is equally grim. The next months and years could see the most difficult conditions in much of Africa since the colonial era, and it is far from clear that traditional supporters in the West will come to the rescue.

There are already signs that China hopes to use the crisis to strengthen its global position. Publicity stunts like Jack Ma's donation of medical supplies to the U.S. show how Beijing intends to convert the disaster of the pandemic into global opportunities. Aid donations plus propaganda about the supposed superiority of China's governance model will find sympathetic ears in many countries, especially if the U.S. and its allies are AWOL. While the crisis lasts, China will have opportunities to deepen security, economic and political relationships with governments around the world.

As the recession hits and the pandemic bites, American, Japanese and European leaders must find ways to respond effectively to problems abroad as well as at home. If the West turns inward until the storm passes, we may not like what we see when the storm clears and we look back out on a changed world.

Investors, Keep Your Eye on the Long Run

The spread of the novel coronavirus is an economic crisis as well as a medical one. The short-term impact is evident in stock and bond market declines and volatility. But that's no reason to panic. The economic effects of calamitous events tend to dissipate in the long run, and the short-term market conditions create opportunities for savvy investors.

The 2007-08 global financial crisis is a good example of how markets bounce back from even the most severe shocks. The U.S. economy contracted by 0.1% in 2008 and 2.5% in 2009. But by 2010 the economy was growing at pre-meltdown rates, and stocks largely recovered by 2013. The crisis created ideal market conditions for purchasing certain assets and liabilities. Long-term investors like CPP Investments, which invests on behalf of Canada's pensioners, bought billions of dollars of high-quality senior loans at steep discounts with the knowledge that these loans would pay full value if held to maturity. They did, resulting in significant gains for Canadian pensioners.

The 9/11 attacks also shocked markets in the short term but left them with no significant long-term damage. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 7.1% on Sept. 17, 2001, the first day after trading resumed. In the weeks after the attacks, consumers purchased fewer goods and services than usual. But demand eventually rebounded. It took only one month for the Dow Jones, Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes to regain their pre-9/11 price levels.

A third proof point is the 1973 oil crisis. After the oil embargo caused oil prices to spike, GDP growth fell from 5.6% in 1973 to minus 0.5% in 1974 and minus 0.2% in 1975. In 1976, however, the economy came roaring back with 5.4% annual growth. GDP growth recovered within three years of the initial event, as it did following 9/11 and the 2007-08 financial crisis.

The Spanish flu of 1918-19, widely regarded as the most devastating pandemic of modern times, caused a massive supply shock as millions were unable to work. Demand cratered as people stayed home and events around the world were canceled for fear of spreading the contagion. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 40% of its value between January 1917 and January 1919 and continued to decline until December 1920. But within three years of the initial crisis, markets began to recover, then rose for nearly a decade.

The 1918-19 flu is most analogous to the global financial crisis in that it created unique opportunities for investors. According to a 2007 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, companies in the health-care and mattress industries saw increases in revenue as a result of the Spanish flu pandemic. Yet, investors with a long-term focus could have invested and achieved outstanding returns even during one of the worst health crises in history.

Collectively these events, spanning more than a century, show that markets almost always recover in the long run. Investors shouldn't ignore short-term circumstance, but neither should they abandon well-crafted plans for the future.

U.S. News: States Seek New Fraud Curbs

The governors of New York and California are proposing significant expansions of state regulatory power over consumer financial services, saying federal oversight has become lax under the Trump administration.

The expanded state agencies, the Democratic governors say, would help compensate for what they see as a lack of enforcement by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. President Obama and congressional Democrats created the CFPB in the wake of the financial crisis to help consumers harmed by problems involving mortgages and other consumer-finance products.

The proposals, if approved in two of the largest states, could lead to similar changes elsewhere and train more scrutiny on Wall Street and financial institutions across the country, legal experts say.

In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has proposed expanding the Department of Financial Services, which has become a major Wall Street watchdog in its almost decade of existence. It oversees more than 1,800 insurance companies and 1,500 financial institutions with over $7 trillion in assets combined.

Mr. Cuomo's proposal would allow DFS to seek larger financial penalties and expand its ability to investigate alleged consumer fraud. It would give the agency the ability to bring investigations like those that are authorized under the Martin Act, which currently gives the New York attorney general broad powers with which to probe securities fraud.

DFS also would gain jurisdiction over securities and companies offering investment advice. The agency could also levy civil penalties against entities that it found engaged in some types of fraud, without being required to show that the fraud was intentional.

In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed expanding and renaming the Department of Business Oversight, which oversees banks, securities brokers, investment advisers and other financial services. His proposal would increase the agency's $103 million budget by at least $19.3 million and add 90 positions to its total of nearly 600 within the next few years.

New York and California officials said they seek the new powers because of less enforcement at the federal level.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Big Downturn, Deficits Forecast --- Global recession looms as outbreak spreads, but economists see second-half U.S. pickup

U.S. households, businesses and investors should brace for a sharp economic downturn in the first half of 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic -- and hope for a bounce back during the second half.

Along the way, the government is on track to test federal budget deficit records hit after the 2008 financial crisis, when annual red ink soared past $1.5 trillion.

Those are two main messages coming from economists as they scramble to update forecasts in a fast-moving health crisis that policy makers are racing to blunt. A contraction in U.S. economic activity, in turn, would mean global recession.

""The economy is shutting down as it grapples with Covid-19,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com, referring to the disease caused by the virus. ""It won't be until the second half of the year, when the virus has presumably passed, that the economy will slowly get back up and running.""

The outlook is highly uncertain. Fed officials, who announced an emergency interest rate cut and other measures on Sunday, decided not to update their own forecasts for the remainder of the year. But coming up with a baseline economic outlook is critical as business leaders make decisions about jobs and investment, households manage their budgets and investors reprice assets.

Mr. Zandi sees the economy contracting at a 1.6% annual rate in the first quarter and a 2.5% pace in the second quarter before picking up in the second half of the year and exceeding 3% growth in 2021.

J.P. Morgan is going with similar projections, with the economy contracting at a 2% rate in the first quarter and a 3% rate in the second, and then bouncing back in the second half of the year. Goldman Sachs sees the economy contracting at a 5% annual rate in the second quarter after no growth in the first, and then strong growth in excess of 3% in the second half of the year. Some analysts see an even bigger contraction in the April-June period.

""Our baseline assumption is that activity will start to recover after April and that (the second half) will see strong sequential growth, but the specifics depend on a number of important questions,"" Goldman said in a note to clients.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Sunday he doesn't believe the U.S. is in a recession, but said, ""We're clearly going to have a slowdown.""

""If the medical professionals are correct, and we're doing all the things, I expect we'll have a big rebound later in the year,"" he said on Fox News Sunday.

These factors will determine the contours of the looming downturn: The path for the coronavirus itself, the response of policy makers to support the economy and the resilience of a financial system being strained by the unexpected shock.

China's virus case load flattened in about three months after major government intervention to curtail social interaction, with devastating effects on economic growth. If the U.S. follows the same path, the initial shock to the economy could begin to wane by May. It isn't clear the virus will follow the same timeline; outside of China, it is still growing exponentially, according to tracking by Johns Hopkins University.

The Fed, after cutting short-term interest rates to near zero and launching bond purchases to tame disruptions in the Treasury and mortgage markets, will now be on the watch for market disruptions that new Fed programs might resolve.

Economists said the bond purchases could be critical in the months ahead to shore up the housing sector, a part of the economy that could play a key role in cushioning a downturn by allowing millions of Americans to refinance, and later to spur a recovery by boosting home building and sales.

""It can lead us out of a recession,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton. ""This is something that we didn't have during the last recession,"" which was caused by a housing downturn, she added.

Another central question is whether state and federal governments are successful at quickly providing relief to workers affected by the slowdown, particularly millions of hourly workers at restaurants, bars, hotels and other consumer-facing businesses that suddenly face a shutdown.

Congress has approved an $8.3 billion emergency spending package aimed at providing immediate funds for health-care spending, and is considering several more in the weeks ahead as officials grapple with how large a stimulus may be necessary.

A second measure, approved by the House of Representatives on Saturday and headed to the Senate this week, would cover the costs of paid sick leave for many workers affected by the coronavirus and cover the costs of testing. It also provides support to the state unemployment insurance program, which could be a key conduit to getting funds to workers directly affected by the crisis.

Mr. Mnuchin said negotiators are focused next on providing targeted relief to industries hardest-hit by coronavirus disruptions, including airlines, hotels and cruise lines, possibly through a mix of loan guarantees and grants. U.S. airlines have started talks with the government to obtain as much as $50 billion in financial assistance, according to people briefed on the discussions.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Tax Law Curbed A Break Firms Now Need

WASHINGTON -- The 2017 tax law is making life harder for U.S. businesses that suffer sudden losses, and Congress is under pressure to relax some of those provisions as the economy reels from the impact of the coronavirus.

To help pay for cutting the corporate tax rate, the law curtailed deductions for net operating losses and interest. The changes to loss deductions, in particular, make it harder for companies to use today's losses against past profits and claim quick refunds for cash infusions.

The previous tax law ""was a classic automatic stabilizer, helping businesses weather an economic storm,"" said Martin Sullivan, chief economist at Tax Analysts, the nonprofit publisher of Tax Notes. ""This is especially important now because businesses, large and small, are seeking liquidity.""

Changes to loss deductions and other business tax provisions could come soon as Congress tries to respond to the economic shock of the virus. The National Association of Manufacturers has already asked Congress to consider loosening rules on loss deductions. ""Wait and see, Congress is gonna wish they hadn't used net operating loss restrictions to pay for rate cuts,"" Mr. Sullivan said.

Retailers, restaurants and the travel industry all may experience sudden drops in revenue as consumers avoid spending. Economists and policy makers have been discussing ways to keep companies afloat until the crisis passes.

Rohit Kumar, PwC LLP's tax policy services leader in Washington, said lawmakers may want to consider restoring deductions for losses. ""If you relieved that obligation or returned to the old rule, you would get some cash into the system relatively quickly,"" said Mr. Kumar, a former Senate Republican aide.

So far, coronavirus relief measures passed or under consideration haven't included business tax cuts other than one that helps them pay for newly mandated employee leave.

But more legislation is likely soon, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has said airlines, cruise lines and hotels may get help to cope with a sudden collapse in sales.

Before the 2017 tax law, businesses could carry their losses back for up to two years to offset past profits and forward for 20 years as deductions against future profits. They could often seek fast refunds of past year's taxes if they started reporting losses.

""You want some safety valve in the system that allows for liquidity, cash liquidity,"" said Dan Luchsinger, chair of the tax practice at Covington and Burling LLP. ""We're in a world now where there is no quickie refund.""

The previous system was a recognition that businesses' fortunes don't necessarily match tax law's annual measurement periods. The deductions effectively allowed businesses to average their income across an entire business cycle.

In the past, including in 2002 and 2009, Congress expanded loss deductions during recessions as a way to get cash to businesses quickly.

But in 2017, with little resistance from corporations, Congress eliminated carrybacks for almost all businesses, meaning that companies can no longer deduct today's losses from yesterday's profits.

Congress also allowed carryforwards to last indefinitely, ending the 20-year limit. And they capped loss deductions used in any year at 80% of a company's taxable income.

As Rates Tumble, Refinancing Boom Swamps Lenders

Record low mortgage rates are delivering more refinancing demand than some lenders can handle.

Homeowners are rushing to refinance their mortgages thanks to big falls in interest rates prompted by fears of the spreading coronavirus. Some lenders are having trouble keeping up with the red-hot demand.

Weekly refinancing applications recently hit their highest level in nearly 11 years, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, the most popular home loan in the U.S., is close to its lowest level in nearly 50 years of record-keeping, hitting 3.36% last week.

Falling rates are generally considered good news for the mortgage market. But the current jump in refinancing demand presents a dilemma for some lenders, which must balance their desire for volume with their capacity to process applications.

Lenders are wary of expanding too quickly in the boom-and-bust mortgage market. What's more, the coronavirus pandemic -- though it helped send mortgage rates down -- could hobble home sales during the important spring selling season. Some would-be sellers are already reluctant to stage open houses, and potential buyers could shy away because they are unsure about their jobs.

Still, many lenders are doing everything they can to increase their ability to take advantage of the current refinancing boom, however long it may last. That includes outsourcing work to other countries and boosting pay for some employees, said Jeff Taylor, managing partner of Digital Risk, a technology and risk firm that consults with mortgage lenders. Underwriters with five years of experience are being offered compensation packages of $130,000, up from about $80,000 in nonpeak times, Mr. Taylor said.

Gordon Miller, president of Miller Lending Group LLC in Cary, N.C., said his firm had to update its website, telling visitors looking for a refinancing quote that someone would get back to them in 48 to 72 hours rather than right away. Mr. Miller also had to change his voice mail, asking callers to leave a number where they could be reached in the evening.

Truist Financial Corp., the sixth-largest U.S. retail bank, said it has seen a major influx in both purchase and refinancing applications. ""The industry does not have the capacity to handle it,"" Chief Executive Kelly King said at an industry conference last week. ""Everybody is trying to staff up.""

Lenders use the 10-year Treasury yield as a guide for setting mortgage rates, and that has been hitting record lows as investors worried about the impact of the virus pile into government bonds.

But mortgage rates don't move in lockstep with Treasury yields. When demand is strong, lenders can be reluctant to lower prices and crimp their profits, especially if their competitors don't. It is akin to gas stations that lower their rates just enough to stay competitive with rivals.

Some lenders are keeping rates relatively high, a sign that borrowers' strong appetite for refinancings is outpacing the industry's ability to make them. The spread between the 10-year Treasury yield and the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is near its largest since 2009. Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. both advertised rates of 4.375% in some markets last week.

U.S. News: U.S. Tosses A Mueller Russia Court Case

A federal judge dismissed part of special counsel Robert Mueller's case against a Russian firm accused of engaging in a widespread effort to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, after the Justice Department said the company was trying to game the U.S. court process.

In an unusual filing late Monday, prosecutors said the company was taking advantage of the rights it was offered under the American legal system, but not fulfilling its obligations. They asked to dismiss the case against Concord Management & Consulting LLC and a related company, while leaving charges in the same indictment against other defendants intact. U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich granted that request.

The case against Concord, the only one of the Russian firms charged by Mr. Mueller's team that has appeared in court to formally respond to the charges, had been scheduled to go to trial in April.

The litigation has been the subject of repeated drama, as a lawyer for Concord accused Mr. Mueller's team of prosecuting a ""made-up crime"" and Mr. Mueller's team later said documents that had been provided to Concord confidentially in the context of the litigation wound up online in an apparent effort to discredit the inquiry.

""Although Concord has availed itself of the Court's jurisdiction to obtain discovery from the United States regarding efforts to detect and deter foreign election interference . . . when pressed to comply with its obligations as a party to this litigation, it has refused to do so,"" prosecutors wrote in the filing.

Concord was indicted in February 2018 alongside two other Russian companies and 13 Russian citizens, and accused of wielding social-media messages, inventing fake personas and staging rallies to sow discord in the U.S. political system.

Concord is run by Yevgeny Prigozhin, who has been known as the Kremlin's favorite restaurateur.

A lawyer for Concord, Eric Dubelier, said the case had ""fundamental problems"" and ""the purpose of this indictment was to make a political statement regarding the outcome of the 2016 election that was grossly overstated.""

Stocks Slide Amid Clampdown --- Governments Enforce Stricter Measures To Slow Spread of Infections in U.S., Europe

The Trump administration urged Americans to avoid nonessential travel and large gatherings, in a significant escalation of its recommendations aimed at slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus, as leaders around the world moved to close borders and restrict movement.

As the center of the pandemic shifts to Europe and the U.S., President Trump's administration outlined new guidelines encouraging the public to end discretionary travel and to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people. The guidelines also encourage home schooling, in addition to avoiding bars, restaurants and food courts.

""Each and every one of us has a critical role to play in stopping the spread and transmission of the virus,"" Mr. Trump said at the White House on Monday.

U.S. stock markets dropped sharply, as fears continue that the measures won't be enough to ward off a recession caused by the pandemic. Economic data from China painted a bleak picture of the impact that government lockdowns have had, with business activity for the first two months of the year turning broadly negative for the first time on record.

Mr. Trump said he wasn't considering a nationwide lockdown and wasn't currently planning domestic travel restrictions.

He said the outbreak could last until July or August.

""It's bad, but we're going to be, hopefully, a best case, not a worst case,"" he said.

Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, later clarified that the guidelines are part of a 15-day trial and will be reconsidered. ""It isn't that these guidelines are now going to be in effect until July,"" he said. ""What the president was saying was that the trajectory of the outbreak may go until then.""

Coronavirus deaths outside China surpassed those inside for the first time on Monday. More than 3,800 people from countries including France, Italy and Iran had died from the new coronavirus as of Monday, compared with around 3,200 in China, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Similarly, the 81,000 total cases of infection in China have been surpassed by the 100,000 outside the country. The first cases of coronavirus infection were reported in the central Chinese province of Hubei in December.

After initially being caught off guard by the virus's rapid spread, countries have enacted blanket bans or severe restrictions on visitors and movement, measures that have rattled citizens who are accustomed to an increasingly interconnected world.

Germany partially shut its borders and declared new wide-ranging restrictions on public life. The European Commission proposed an unprecedented 30-day restriction on nonessential travel to the European Union, and Emmanuel Macron of France ordered on Monday a nationwide quarantine, barring people from leaving their homes.

""We are at war,"" the French president said several times during his address. ""All government action must turn towards fighting this epidemic.""

Canada said it was closing its borders to most nonresidents, though the ban doesn't apply to trade, commerce or visitors from the U.S. Officials and historians said they don't recall such a blanket ban on foreign visitors entering Canada since World War II. And countries including Singapore, Brunei and Panama have strongly discouraged citizens from leaving except for essential travel.

In South America, Colombia shut its 1,400-mile border with Venezuela, while Chile said it would close its own border with neighbors Peru, Bolivia and Argentina. Peru has closed its land borders, and Ecuador and Argentina said they would do the same.

In the U.S., in a major shift in local response, about 6.7 million people in the Bay Area have been ordered to stay at home for three weeks except for essential needs, officials said Monday.

New Jersey, New York and Connecticut are also instituting a recommended curfew between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m. Other cities, including New York City and Los Angeles, said they would close entertainment venues and limit restaurants and bars to takeout and delivery, but haven't ordered residents to stay home.

The president and his senior advisers stressed that young people can spread the virus even if they have mild symptoms. Ambassador Deborah Birx, special representative for global health diplomacy, said millennials are ""the core groups that will stop this virus.""

As the virus spreads across the U.S., daily life has become more disrupted as the days go on. More than 4,250 confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus have been reported across the country on Monday and at least 74 people have died, according to Johns Hopkins.

Once-bustling streets have quieted as hundreds of schools close, businesses enforce new work from home rules, and more state and local governments enact strong restrictions on large public gatherings, restaurants, bars and entertainment venues. The National Education Association, the largest union in the country, called for all schools to immediately close for at least two weeks.

Washington state, the site of one of the largest outbreaks in the country, said it would close restaurants and bars, except for pickup and delivery, and limit large gatherings to 50 people.

Restrictions are being put in place in the highest offices in the land. The Supreme Court on Monday canceled its March hearing schedule.

The U.S. Senate on Monday began consideration of a House coronavirus response bill that would make testing free and provide paid sick leave to many of those affected by the outbreak, as the first National Institutes of Health-funded novel coronavirus vaccine trial began in Seattle earlier than expected.

The World Health Organization has called on countries to use aggressive measures to limit gatherings and save lives in what it now considers a global pandemic.

The outbreak has now infected more than 181,100 people in 155 countries and territories, according to Johns Hopkins.

Apple Fined By France For Cartel --- Regulator gives the iPhone maker the country's largest antitrust penalty

PARIS -- France's competition authority issued Apple Inc. the country's largest ever antitrust fine against a single company, accusing the maker of iPhones and iPads of orchestrating a distribution cartel with wholesalers that lasted for several years.

The 1.1 billion euro ($1.23 billion) fine, issued Monday after nearly a decade of investigation, came as part of a decision that also found Apple had effectively imposed prices on some retailers and had ""abused the economic dependence"" of some of its premium resellers in France.

Apple said it strongly disagreed with the decision and would appeal the decision in court.

A spokesman for Apple said: ""The French Competition Authority's decision is disheartening. It relates to practices from over a decade ago and discarded 30 years of legal precedent that all companies in France rely on with an order that will cause chaos for companies across all industries.""

The fine comes as large technology companies are increasingly in the crosshairs of antitrust officials on both sides of the Atlantic.

In the U.S., federal antitrust enforcers at the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, as well as at the state level, have separately trained their sights on Alphabet Inc. unit Google, Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Apple.

In the European Union, the European Commission, the bloc's top competition authority, has also launched at least preliminary investigations into those companies, on various topics.

Google is seeking to overturn three EU antitrust rulings against it that have totaled more than $9 billion in fines.

Monday's decision stems from a 2012 complaint from a premium retailer of Apple products in France. The competition authority said that between December 2005 and March 2013, Apple had operated a cartel with two electronics wholesalers: Tech Data Corp., based in Clearwater, Fla., and Ingram Micro, now part of China's HNA Group.

""Apple and its two wholesalers agreed not to compete and prevent distributors from competing with each other, sterilizing the wholesale market for Apple products,"" Isabelle de Silva, president of France's competition authority, said in announcing the decision.

The authority fined those two companies -- 76.1 million euros for Tech Data and 63 million euros for Ingram Micro -- for participating in the arrangement.

Tech Data said it is ""determining how we will respond and therefore do not plan to provide additional comment at this time.""

Ingram Micro said it would appeal the decision, saying, ""These claims [in the decision] are absolutely false.""

The French authority also accused Apple of effectively imposing prices on retailers in France between October 2012 and April 2017, saying that Apple would strongly suggest retail prices and then follow retailers' compliance.

The authority said that ""created a risk of retaliation -- in the form of non-delivery"" for unauthorized promotions.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: A Second Wave of Cases Grips Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong

Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong are witnessing fresh waves of coronavirus infections, as the growing number of cases around the world test their successful early defenses against the disease.

Singapore reported 23 new cases late Tuesday, its highest daily count since the epidemic started. Taiwan recorded a single-day high of 10 cases of infection, bringing its total to 77. Hong Kong added five new cases -- a day after it recorded nine -- the most since Feb. 9.

Singapore, Taiwan and Hong Kong, which were hit early by the fast-spreading coronavirus because of their close economic and social ties with China, have been lauded for effectively controlling initial outbreaks with fast and aggressive responses. Now, they face fresh challenges as coronavirus cases soar in Europe and the Middle East and returning travelers bring back new risks.

""The trouble with this virus is that it is very unpredictable. We do not know who will be at the center of a super-spreading event,"" said Paul Anantharajah Tambyah, the president of the Asia-Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection. ""We are not safe in any place until everyone all over the world is safe.""

Globally, cases of infection rose to more than 182,000 on Tuesday and the number of deaths hit 7,155, according to Johns Hopkins University. The fast rise has set off more lockdowns and travel halts.

The Trump administration urged Americans to put off traveling and avoid gatherings of more than 10 people, as infections and deaths outside China exceeded those inside. Its guidance expanded on earlier restrictions that banned most inbound travel from Europe and the U.K.

Millions of people in the San Francisco Bay Area were ordered to remain at home for three weeks and restrictions on bars and restaurants were expanded beyond New York City and Los Angeles to Minnesota and Kentucky.

In addition, Germany unveiled broad restrictions on travel and public life, while France ordered a nationwide quarantine.

The growing tally of infections globally is also forcing new steps in parts of the world that had appeared to have a handle on the virus's spread.

Taiwan reported its first case in early January and moved quickly to enforce quarantine rules on arrivals from China, Hong Kong and Macau. This kept the island's daily new infection counts to single digits for two months -- until the center of the pandemic shifted from Asia. The past three days have brought more than 30% of Taiwan's total cases, most of them involving travelers returning from vacations in places like Europe.

""You can see from the current situation -- compared with the previous wave -- it came much more quickly,"" Taiwan Minister of Health and Welfare Chen Shih-chung said Monday.

The recent clusters of Taiwanese patients included nine people returning from a vacation in Turkey with the same tour group, provoking a social-media outcry about leisure travel in the wake of the global pandemic.

""If you know a friend who is still traveling for fun, please immediately break up with him -- Right now!"" one Twitter user wrote.

On Tuesday, Taiwan extended its self-quarantine rules to cover travelers coming from Washington state, New York and California, as well as Japan and a number of countries in Southeast Asia. Mr. Chen, the island's top health official, strongly advised citizens to avoid unnecessary travel to those places. He said people who knowingly ignore the travel warning won't be eligible for government subsidies during their 14-day quarantines and their names would be made public.

Singapore closed its borders to Chinese travelers on Feb. 1, about a week after China said it would lock down the city of Wuhan, where the first coronavirus infections were reported. It set up a national task force to coordinate its response, ran detailed contact-tracing searches and imposed strict quarantines.

In the past week, after imported cases rose, authorities restricted entry for visitors from many European countries, South Korea and Iran and imposed two-week quarantines for residents and short-term visitors from Southeast Asia. They also strongly discouraged citizens from traveling overseas and recalled exchange students who are studying abroad.

Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said arrivals from all foreign countries would be placed under home quarantine for two weeks beginning Thursday -- extending a quarantine rule that had previously affected travelers from hot spots like China, Iran, Korea and parts of Europe.

""From now on, I would say the majority of arrivals in Hong Kong will be put under home quarantine or medical surveillance of some form,"" Mrs. Lam said at a press conference on Tuesday.

Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region, the disruption and number of cases continued to mount. National Australia Bank, vacated its headquarters in Melbourne after an employee tested positive for the virus. The building will be ""pandemically cleansed,"" NAB Chief Executive Ross McEwan said in a letter to staff posted online Tuesday. Johns Hopkins data show Australia has 377 confirmed cases of infection.

Malaysian Curbs

Spark Panic Buying

News that Malaysia would implement severe international border restrictions until the end of the month led to a wave of panic buying in Singapore's supermarkets.

Singaporeans were seen cleaning out trays of fresh vegetables, poultry and toilet paper within an hour of the announcement, which came late Monday night.

""Everybody is afraid the Malaysian border closures would mean we'll end up with limited fresh vegetables and eggs,"" said Linus Lim, a 45-year-old Singapore information-technology executive, who stopped by a large supermarket with his two colleagues, hoping to buy some fresh poultry.

They found empty shelves and only one or two packs of chicken.

Trays containing fresh potatoes, broccoli and carrots were bare and shoppers were picking over the last packs of green beans.

Mr. Lim left with ice cream and milk instead.

A store assistant who was manning the poultry counter at the supermarket said the crowd started coming in at 8 a.m. and had cleaned out coolers of fresh pork and chicken by midmorning.

By Tuesday afternoon, the supermarket had started to limit purchases of meat, instant noodles and toilet paper.

The government sent out a statement later Tuesday to try to reassure citizens that Singapore had an adequate supply of food and essentials and the country wouldn't be affected by Malaysia's border shutdown.

U.S. News: Retail Sales Dim, but Steeper Drop Looms

WASHINGTON -- American shoppers reined in their spending last month and factory production was broadly flat, signs the economy began to strain as the threat from the new coronavirus started to take hold.

The Commerce Department's reading on retail sales in February showed they declined by a seasonally adjusted 0.5%, falling well short of expectations and suggesting coronavirus concerns dented consumers' appetite for spending on purchases like vehicles and electronics.

While some of the retail-sales decline was attributable to a drop in gasoline prices, overall weakness suggests consumers began to pull back on spending last month as the coronavirus outbreak spread within U.S. borders.

Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve said Tuesday that manufacturing production edged up 0.1% in February as disruptions at Boeing Co. continued to hold down overall factory output.

Overall industrial production, a measure of factory, mining and utility output, increased a seasonally adjusted 0.6% in February from the prior month, the Federal Reserve said, as utility output rose strongly due to cold weather.

Tuesday's reports encompassed a month in which coronavirus began to spread within the U.S., although the number of cases remained relatively low. Since last month, financial markets have plummeted and consumers have begun to self-isolate amid a widening coronavirus pandemic -- factors that are likely to hit the economy hard in the months ahead.

""With strict measures restraining social activities now in place to contain the coronavirus outbreak, consumer spending is poised for a severe pullback in coming months,"" Gregory Daco of Oxford Economics said in a note to clients, adding that ""disruptions from the coronavirus will bring the economy's main engine to a halt.""

Americans reined in spending on dining out, as sales at bars and restaurants dropped 0.5% in February. Sales at clothing, building material, grocery and health stores also dropped. One bright spot was nonstore retailers, a category that includes internet merchants such as Amazon.com Inc., which rose 0.7% as consumers shunned malls and brick-and-mortar stores.

""The March [retail sales] figures are going to be off-the-charts bad, and the April results may not show much of a rebound, depending on how long the more extreme social distancing steps remain in place,"" Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities, said in a note to clients.

Grocers, drugstores and mass merchants that sell food and household staples such as Walmart Inc. and Target Corp. have said they plan to stay open but many clothing and mall-based chains have announced temporary closures.

Over the weekend, Apple Inc. and Nike, which are big drivers of foot traffic, said they would shut their U.S. stores for two weeks. The list of retail closings has expanded by the day to include chains such as Nordstrom Inc., Foot Locker Inc., Williams Sonoma Inc. and J.Crew Group Inc. Even those that are staying open, such as Kohl's Corp. and J.C. Penney Co., said they would reduce hours this month.

Recreational Equipment Inc. said Sunday that it would close all 162 retail stores for nearly two weeks due to the outbreak, although customers can still shop online.

REI said it would continue to pay store employees during the temporary store closures.

The pandemic is also hitting smaller business operators. Dante Hill, a chef in Austin, Texas, said the cancellation of the South by Southwest festival means ""70% of my work for the next two weeks is gone.""

""I work with several companies in Austin and this has hit everyone, some to the tune of several hundred thousand dollars,"" Mr. Hill said.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Europe's Fiscal Remedies Risk Deepening Its Economic Gaps

European governments have pledged hundreds of billions of euros to help economies, companies and workers hit by the coronavirus, applying tools developed during the euro crisis and casting aside strict prohibitions on state subsidies.

The stimulus moves, which come on top of increased government spending automatically triggered during a downturn, could help fiscally sound countries including Germany and the Netherlands to weather the growing economic crisis. But it might not alleviate hardship for weaker countries such as Italy.

That divergence could aggravate an economic gap at the heart of Europe's currency union if it widens the gulf between the region's strong and weak economies, which in the long term could further cloud the single currency's future.

Only a small amount of the total amount pledged so far is stimulus spending that will go directly to business or workers, and most are commitments that may never be drawn on. The amounts are designed both as direct help and toboost confidence among banks, employers and investors.

European Union finance ministers said that already announced fiscal-stimulus plans amounted to 1% of the bloc's output in 2020 and that liquidity support through government guarantees and deferred tax payments was at least 10% of the EU's GDP.

""These figures could be much larger going forward,"" the ministers said.

At the onset of the financial crisis in late 2008, the EU pumped 200 billion euros ($220 billion) into the economy, around 1.5% of GDP.

France and the Netherlands on Tuesday became the latest countries to open the spigot. France promised 45 billion euros in immediate aid for businesses and employees hit by the coronavirus pandemic, which is slowing or shutting down swaths of the global economy.

French Finance Minister Bruno LeMaire said provisional predictions show the response to the coronavirus will slash 1% from France's gross domestic product this year.

""This economic war will be long-lasting and violent,"" Mr. LeMaire said on French radio.

The Dutch government announced a raft of measures to support companies, ranging from tax exemptions to having up to 90% of wages paid by the government. The measures are expected to cost 10 billion euros to 20 billion euros over the next three months, but that sum could increase, said Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra.

The move followed the crisis response measures of Germany, Europe's biggest economy and so far the country that has pledged the greatest action. Government officials said last week they would provide potentially unlimited government financing for disrupted businesses, including measures that helped Germany emerge from the financial crisis a decade ago largely unscathed.

Central to Berlin's plan is a 550 billion euro loan and loan-guarantee program for businesses of all sizes, though the government stressed that it has no limit on financial support.

But Italy and Spain, two nations currently hit hardest by the virus, have been more cautious. Italy's government announced a 25 billion euro spending plan on Monday that included additional funds for health care, and provisions to suspend tax payments and provide mortgage relief to affected businesses and households. Spain on Tuesday announced up to 200 billion euros in support, including private funds the government hopes to mobilize. Only 17 billion euros of the total would be direct support.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Britain's Better Stimulus

The economic war Prime Minister Boris Johnson wanted to fight was for Britain's prosperity after Brexit. The war he has instead is against the damage wrought by Covid-19. His Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak, fired the first broadside Tuesday with a major raft of supply-side measures.

The centerpiece is a loan-guarantee program worth GBP 330 billion, or around 15% of gross domestic product, for businesses of all sizes. Larger firms will be able to tap the central bank directly, while smaller companies will access the facility through their banks. That GBP 330 billion is only the start. Chancellor Whatever-It-Takes (Mr. Sunak used that phrase six times in his brief prepared remarks) promises to expand the guarantees to match demand.

Mr. Sunak also is offering hospitality businesses a holiday on payment of the tax on business premises, and all small companies will be eligible for one-off grants ranging from GBP 10,000 to GBP 25,000. Coupled with other measures announced in last week's budget, direct support will be worth GBP 32 billion, or 1.6% of GDP. Add to that a modest demand-side stimulus, including a previously announced GBP 1 billion welfare expansion and moral suasion on mortgage lenders to offer three-month repayment holidays to affected workers.

In proportion to GDP, these measures are larger than other national governments have attempted so far. Crucially, they're targeted at the supply side of the economy. Mr. Sunak recognizes that a Keynesian demand stimulus won't work if a quarantined population can't get to the stores. The goal instead has to be to tide otherwise viable companies over a once-in-a-century health emergency without allowing a wave of business closures or defaults to trigger a financial crisis and recession.

Other governments, including the U.S., are likely to take a different approach. They couldn't resist in 2009, with baleful consequences for economic growth. We hope Messrs. Johnson and Sunak don't lose their supply-side nerve as the economic panic deepens.

For now Mr. Sunak is right that demand-side stimulus won't help the British economy if consumers are quarantined for a prolonged period. His supply-side alternatives provide a timelier response, with the public able to judge the results soon enough.

JPMorgan Probed on Treasurys --- Government expands campaign against spoofing beyond derivatives

WASHINGTON -- Authorities are investigating whether traders at JPMorgan Chase & Co. manipulated the market for Treasury securities and futures contracts, according to regulatory disclosures and people familiar with the matter.

The investigation shows that federal prosecutors and regulators continue to expand a campaign against an illicit practice known as spoofing, which has mainly focused on wily trading in derivatives. A move to scrutinize whether similar practices have affected the $17 trillion market for Treasury securities would open a new, and potentially more complicated, front in the war on spoofing.

The bank disclosed in a Feb. 25 regulatory filing that it is dealing with ""related requests concerning similar trading-practices issues in markets for other financial instruments, such as U.S. Treasurys."" According to people familiar with the matter, the investigation also is probing the bank's trading in futures. It couldn't be learned which time period authorities are focusing their investigation on.

The Justice Department's Fraud Section and regulators at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are involved, the people said. A spokeswoman for JPMorgan declined to comment. A spokesman for the Justice Department declined to comment.

Regulators and other authorities cracked down on spoofing after Congress specifically outlawed the feinting strategy in 2010. Citigroup Inc. paid $25 million in 2017 to settle regulatory claims that five traders spoofed Treasury futures. The same year, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. paid $600,000 to resolve CFTC claims over similar misconduct.

Prosecutors' record against individual traders is mixed, however. The Justice Department has prevailed in one trial that alleged spoofing violations, but lost two others.

Spoofers typically send large orders to futures exchanges intended to change the appearance of supply and demand. If prices move in response, the spoofers may succeed at their goal -- getting a smaller order filled. They then cancel the larger order as quickly as possible. The 2010 law forbade the practice of sending misleading orders that traders don't intend to have executed.

Prosecutors and regulators have relied on detecting such trading patterns in data they obtain from futures-exchange owner CME Group Inc. Trading in Treasury securities has similarly moved to electronic venues -- one owned by CME -- although trading remains more dispersed than in futures, said James Angel, a finance professor at Georgetown University.

Unlike futures, which the CFTC oversees, no single regulator monitors trading in Treasury securities, which is considered the world's deepest and most-liquid bond market. Almost 75% of the $623 billion in average daily volume in February was traded electronically, according to Greenwich Associates research.

A move to examine trading practices in Treasury securities would be a big step in a market that has historically had little transparency, said Kevin McPartland, head of market structure and technology research at Greenwich.

""The CFTC has oversight of the futures market, full stop,"" Mr. McPartland said, ""whereas the government has always taken a light touch to the markets for trading its own debt.""

The CFTC's spoofing law doesn't apply to trading in Treasury securities, which is covered by different antifraud laws enforced by the Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission. While the CFTC has brought enforcement cases against banks over spoofing in Treasury futures, only the DOJ and SEC can police the trading of Treasury bonds, bills and notes.

Some traders say it is likely harder to manipulate secondary-market prices in U.S. Treasurys, because order sizes on the electronic networks, which serve banks and the largest proprietary trading firms, are larger than in stocks and futures.

""It is going to be a lot harder for the government to catch spoofers in the cash Treasury market than in the futures market,"" Mr. Angel said.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
A Tax-Delay Boost

Lawmakers are wrangling over how best to help Americans hit by the virus shutdown, but credit to the Trump Administration for moving decisively on one helpful idea. Its decision to delay IRS filing and payment deadlines to July 15 will be a boon to struggling Americans and an economy in need of liquidity.

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Tuesday announced the IRS will allow individuals who owe $1 million or less in taxes an additional 90 days beyond April 15 to pay their bill. This high threshold is designed to open the relief to many ""pass through"" businesses that employ workers but file taxes through the individual code. The delay will also apply to corporations owing less than $10 million in taxes. And the IRS will waive interest and penalties.

The tax agency as of March 6 had received about 68 million individual tax returns -- or fewer than half of what it expects to see filed. Most early filers are those who knew they were due a refund, and Treasury is encouraging other Americans in that situation to file by April 15 and get their money as soon as possible.

Later filers tend to be those who know they owe the tax man, so this extension will allow tens of millions of individuals a much-needed bridge loan, even as it helps businesses struggling with cash flow. Mr. Mnuchin estimates the delay will keep as much as $300 billion in the economy for now. Treasury may have to engage in some near-term borrowing, but the feds are in a position to easily tap that money -- unlike most average Joes.

The practical virtue of the IRS move is that it allows filers in need of a financial cushion the choice of exercising a tax delay. That's in contrast to plans for government to dump dollars on individuals or industries willy-nilly. It's the model to bear in mind as Washington decides what to do next.

U.S. News: In a Twist, Asbestos Suit Targets College

PITTSBURGH -- Peter Labosky Jr. had been retired for 12 years from his job as a professor of wood sciences at Pennsylvania State University when he was diagnosed in 2014 with mesothelioma. He died five months later.

Mr. Labosky's family alleges in a lawsuit filed in 2016 that the university negligently exposed him to asbestos dust after failing to clean it up in buildings where he taught. The case is working its way through state court in Pittsburgh.

The lawsuit is proceeding amid louder calls to clean up asbestos and halt its use nationally. It appears to be the first of its kind brought against a university, creating a new path for asbestos litigation, said legal experts. It could open the door to similar suits in Pennsylvania, and raise awareness about potential exposures at universities in other states.

""This could raise a lot of concern by employers with regard to the facilities they provide to their workers which may contain asbestos products,"" said Lester Brickman, an emeritus professor at Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York who has written extensively on asbestos litigation.

Penn State defends its handling of asbestos as proactive and careful, and doesn't comment on pending litigation, said Lisa Powers, a spokeswoman for the university.

Asbestos was widely used from the 1940s to the 1980s and is still in hundreds of thousands of buildings, including schools, across the country. Asbestos was banned from most building materials in the 1980s, but older buildings, including schools, typically contain ceilings, floor tiles, pipe insulation and other materials with asbestos used for its fireproof and acoustic qualities.

Last year, 18 state attorneys general asked Congress to prevent all uses of the material. A bill in the House would ban the manufacture and distribution of asbestos.

In Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf in January proposed spending more than $1 billion to remove asbestos and lead in schools. The School District of Philadelphia said it has 175 buildings with asbestos, and it has closed nine since September due to health concerns.

""Asbestos can be contained and managed on-site,"" said Claire Barnett, executive director of Healthy Schools Network, which advocates for removing environmental hazards in schools. But if maintenance is poor, moisture can cause asbestos to crumble, exposing its deadly dust, she said. ""It happens everywhere.""

An estimated 40,000 people die in the U.S. from asbestos-related diseases each year, including mesothelioma, a cancer of the linings of the lungs or stomach that can develop 30 years or more after exposure.

Asbestos litigation, which has been moving through court dockets for years, has to date largely targeted product manufacturers. Workplace injuries are usually handled through workers' compensation claims, but people who develop asbestos-related diseases years after retiring are often beyond the deadline for filing such a claim against an employer.

A 2013 court ruling in Pennsylvania allowed people who develop an asbestos-related disease to sue an employer for negligence outside of the workers' compensation act and made the suit against Penn State and other potential cases possible.

Universities typically monitor asbestos, as required by federal and state regulations, and remove it during renovations. Penn State found in the 1970s that close to 100 buildings contained asbestos, according to court documents. By 1984, the school had spent over $500,000 removing asbestos.

During the 1980s the cost of removing asbestos at the university rose fivefold, according to court documents. In 1989, a Penn State official stated in a memorandum that the school would no longer remove asbestos when it was encountered.

""In all future projects, our goal should be to minimize the removal of asbestos to only what is absolutely required,"" the official wrote. ""Obviously, this will help us a lot in the area of project budgets.""

Michael Robb, a Pittsburgh attorney representing the Labosky family, alleges that the university scaled back its asbestos removal to cut costs while it knew about health risks.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Plans in Works to Help Pay the Bills

Behind a flurry of activity in Washington on Tuesday was an increasingly urgent problem for a nation grappling with the novel coronavirus pandemic: The growing risk that millions of businesses and households won't be able to pay their everyday bills -- rent, payroll, utilities -- as business activity grinds to an unprecedented halt.

The Federal Reserve launched a program to provide short-term loans to businesses in commercial-paper markets, while White House officials and lawmakers scrambled for ideas to get funds into the private sector, and the Treasury postponed one of the biggest bills coming due for anyone: individual income taxes.

In a normally functioning economy, paychecks and revenues roll in for workers and their employers, and they use a good chunk of that money to pay the bills they have coming due. In the business world, it's called working capital.

Now as restaurants close, airlines stop flying and streets go empty, businesses and households have a similar and pressing problem: The money just isn't coming in, but bills still have to get paid.

The financial system typically serves as a backstop. Businesses use credit lines to alleviate short-term funding squeezes. A household might draw from savings or tap a home-equity line.

But those systems are becoming overloaded. It's an especially pressing problem for millions of low- and middle-income households. Nearly 4 in 10 Americans don't have the savings in hand to cover an unexpected, $400 expense with cash, according to Fed surveys.

Fed data shown on financial businesses had $1.53 in liquid assets like cash and securities on hand for every $1 in short-term liabilities in the fourth quarter. That is down from $1.80 when Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008, but up from $1.34 during the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, according to Moody's Analytics. The more liquid assets they hold, the better positioned they are to handle a cash crunch.

The Fed took additional steps to address the problem Tuesday, throwing a rescue line to commercial paper markets, where banks, money market mutual funds and others provide short-term loans of a few days, weeks or months directly to businesses.

The Fed will provide funds to financial firms for up to three months and take their commercial paper as collateral. The central bank hopes that with a place to park their commercial paper, lenders will make more of it available in markets. The program will be backstopped by the U.S. Treasury to cushion losses the Fed might take in the process.

A pressing question is whether Congress and the White House can fill that void.

""We desperately need . . . a dedicated pool of money that is available to step in and salvage viable companies that are struggling,"" Scott Minerd, chief investment officer at money-manager Guggenheim Partners LLC, said Tuesday. A global depression is possible ""if policy makers don't act quickly,"" he said.

Some ideas -- such as a broad payroll tax cut -- might not deliver funds quickly enough or directly to the people in most dire need to hold off the impending cash crunch. For the moment, the White House and a growing number of lawmakers seemed to be turning to more immediate measures.

For starters, the Internal Revenue Service will postpone the April 15 tax-payment deadline. The Trump administration also said it backs a plan to send checks directly to Americans.

Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) on Monday backed giving each American adult $1,000.

Among Democrats, Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey, Michael Bennet of Colorado and Sherrod Brown of Ohio propose sending $2,000 to every adult and child below a set income, with future payments in July and then quarterly, until unemployment levels drop after an expected rise.

Last week, Reps. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.) and Tim Ryan (D., Ohio) proposed sending a check between $1,000 and $6,000 to every American who earned less than $65,000 last year.

""To me, this is about cash,"" Mr. Ryan said.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: IRS Extends April 15 Deadline for Payments

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. government will postpone the April 15 tax-payment deadline for millions of individuals, giving Americans an additional 90 days to pay their 2019 income-tax bills in an unprecedented move intended to ease the economic pain inflicted by the coronavirus.

The IRS, using authority under President Trump's national-emergency declaration, will waive interest and penalties as well, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday. The delay is available to people who owe $1 million or less and corporations that owe $10 million or less, he said.

Mr. Mnuchin said the move could provide $300 billion in temporary liquidity, giving households and businesses a financial cushion as they cope with the sudden slowdown in economic activity caused by the coronavirus epidemic.

""We are going to use all the tools we have,"" Mr. Mnuchin said. ""And what tools we don't have, we're going to go to Congress.""

The IRS will continue to process tax refunds. Taxpayers should file their returns as usual by April 15 but they can defer payment for up to 90 days beyond that, according to the Senate Finance Committee. Presumably, they can also seek six-month extensions and defer payment, but the IRS hasn't made that clear yet.

Tax preparers warned that requiring taxpayers to file returns or requests for extensions by April 15 would create unnecessary work and stress over the next month as people try to complete returns or extensions.

""Had they not decoupled the payment date from the due date, and just blanket extended everything to July 15, we as tax preparers and employers, and just plain old citizens, could ratchet back the amount of time we spend together daily and weekly,"" said Ken Goodrow, an accountant at Tyler, Simms & St. Sauveur in Lebanon, N.H.

""Unless this return due date moves we are all in for a much busier, much more stressful month than normal,"" he said.

The IRS hasn't explained whether taxpayers can also defer estimated-tax payments for the first quarter of 2020, which are also due on April 15.

Banking & Finance: Market Recess Suggested --- Money managers talk of two-week shutdown in call with new Bank of England governor

Executives from some of the biggest asset managers told the Bank of England's new governor on Monday that financial markets should close for two weeks as the world confronts the coronavirus pandemic, people familiar with the matter said.

Speaking on a conference call with Bank of England Gov. Andrew Bailey, several executives raised the possibility of a shutdown during a wide-ranging discussion on the state of the markets and the financial-services industry. A majority of those on the call, though, said they didn't think shuttering the markets would help address the deepening crisis, the people said.

Mr. Bailey, who began his term as governor on Monday, held the call with senior executives from some of the world's biggest asset managers, including Vanguard Group, BlackRock Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp., people familiar with the matter said.

It couldn't be learned which asset manager executives wanted to close the markets and which didn't.

Steven Mnuchin, the U.S. Treasury secretary, said Tuesday that the White House plans to keep financial markets open, though ""we may get to a point where we shorten the hours."" He said he had discussed the markets with bank executives and officials at the New York Stock Exchange, and ""everybody wants to keep it open.""

The NYSE and other U.S. stock markets closed in 2012 as the East Coast contended with superstorm Sandy, and in the aftermath of the September 2001 terrorist attacks.

On the call with Mr. Bailey, the executives delivered a grim assessment of the credit markets and urged the central bank to take additional steps to support the banking system as it confronts the fallout from the pandemic.

Many riskier securities, including junk bonds and emerging-market debts, were now near impossible to trade, they said. They recommended steps that would make it easier for companies and other issuers to refinance their debts.

U.S. stocks fell sharply on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average posting its second-worst day in the benchmark's history. Trading was halted for 15 minutes shortly after the opening bell, marking the third time in six sessions that a selloff had triggered the marketwide circuit-breaker. On Tuesday, the benchmark stock indexes regained some of those declines.

The yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note rose to 0.870%, from 0.722% Monday. The U.S. government bond market has been unusually volatile in recent days, reflecting investors' growing anxiety as well as the liquidity constraints surfacing in various corners of the market amid the broader rout.

Spreads on corporate bonds, or the extra yield investors demand over Treasurys, has been increasing at an unprecedented speed, Morgan Stanley analysts said.

On Monday's call with the asset management executives, Mr. Bailey acknowledged the need for central banks to address the markets' liquidity needs and the challenges posed by traders working from home as governments seek to contain the virus's spread, people familiar with the matter said.

Working outside their trading floors had further diminished the banks' appetite for taking on risk, the executives said.

The Federal Reserve said Sunday it had adjusted a program with other central banks, including the Bank of England, to make U.S. dollars available overseas at near-zero interest rates.

On Monday, the Fed unleashed a series of additional moves to stabilize markets, slashing the benchmark interest rate to near zero and agreeing to buy $700 billion in Treasury and mortgage-backed securities. And on Tuesday, the Fed said it would establish a lending facility to help support short-term commercial debt.

On Monday's conference call, the executives told Mr. Bailey that most mutual funds weren't yet facing a stampede of outflows from either big institutional clients or individual investors, and the continuing stability of those assets under management was critical to their industry's health.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: Devout Iranians Defy Tehran's Call to Avoid Shrines

TEHRAN -- Iranian worshipers have attempted to break into holy shrines and mosques, defying Iran's leaders who are trying to bar access to religious sites as they struggle to stem a soaring death rate caused by the new coronavirus.

Police in the central city of Qom on Tuesday apprehended 11 rioters who the night before clashed with mosque guards as they tried to enter one of Iran's holiest sites, the Masoumeh shrine, the Qom prosecutor told state television. The same night in the city of Mashhad, worshipers tried to enter the largest religious site in the country, the Imam Reza shrine. The shrine remained shut on Tuesday.

President Hassan Rouhani is trying to balance demands from some Iranians for mass quarantines with pushback from those who oppose restrictions on religious and economic activities. The tension comes as some experts warn that fatalities in Iran from Covid-19 could reach into the millions if public disregard for official guidelines continues.

The acts of the worshipers in Qom went against not just the central government, but also against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has urged all Iranians to follow the measures introduced by the Health Ministry.

Mr. Khamenei last week said medical personnel who die after contracting the coronavirus should be considered martyrs, a title usually reserved for those who perish in war. On Tuesday, the supreme leader issued a religious ruling prohibiting unnecessary travel during the outbreak.

Iran is battling one of the world's worst outbreaks of Covid-19. The Health Ministry on Tuesday logged 135 deaths over the previous 24 hours, bringing the number of fatalities to 988. More than 16,000 people have been infected from the illness caused by the new coronavirus in Iran.

Some are warning that Iran's death toll will continue to soar -- and just how high will depend on compliance with public-health advice.

In a new study, cited by Iranian state media, researchers at the renowned Sharif University of Technology in Tehran said if the Iranian population begins fully cooperating with advice from authorities now, the outbreak will peak in early April, leading to an estimated 12,000 deaths. If they refuse to cooperate, Iran's strained medical system will be overwhelmed, and the peak will occur in June, causing as many as 3.5 million people to die, the study said.

Iran isn't alone in attempting to stem the tide of worshipers to holy sites -- and containing the risks such mass congregations pose in spreading the virus.

On Tuesday, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the paramount spiritual authority in Iraq, who also commands loyalty among millions of Shiites across the world, issued a religious edict designating the fight against the coronavirus a collective duty.

Mr. Sistani likened the work of medical workers to that of ""heroic fighters"" and said those who fell in the line of duty should be considered martyrs. Both the Shiite and Sunni authorities have instructed all mosques under their authority across Iraq to be closed.

Saudi Arabia also on Tuesday suspended all mass prayers, including Friday prayer, in all mosques, with the exception of the two holy mosques in Mecca and Medina, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.

In Iran, authorities on Monday closed four important religious sites after weekslong calls to shut shrines and mosques to avoid mass gatherings. The Masoumeh shrine in Qom and the Imam Reza Mosque in the eastern city of Mashhad are two of the country's holiest sites. Authorities also closed the Shah-Abdol Azim shrine in Tehran and the Jamkaran Mosque in Qom.

While Iranian authorities say Qom is the source of its Covid-19 epidemic, they hadn't until Monday restricted travel or closed religious sites in the city, although local authorities had banned hotels and guest houses from taking travelers.

The Imam Reza shrine in Mashhad attracts up to 25 million Iranian and non-Iranian pilgrims a year. The Astan Quds Razavi, which runs the shrine, is one of Iran's wealthiest and most politically powerful foundations.

Some Iranian conservatives have for decades resisted government interference in religious practices. A video circulated on social media showed a worshiper on Monday outside the Masoumeh shrine in Qom accusing Iran's Ministry of Health of obeying orders from the World Health Organization, which he said didn't believe in religion.

""If you are a true believer, this door must be opened tonight,"" the instigator said, adding that for 1,400 years no Iranian ruler had managed to shut the shrine.

Iranian politicians criticized attempts to breach the shrines. Prominent reformist Mostafa Tajzadeh called the rioters an irresponsible minority, while lawmaker Ali Motahhari said they should be prosecuted for spreading the virus and defaming Islam.

The Iranian government has urged people to minimize travel around the country and those with symptoms to stay home, but it has refrained from imposing quarantines, even during the two-week Persian New Year, which begins March 20.

Iranian police on Monday banned the annual fire festival, slated for Tuesday, which is part of the New Year celebrations, but police chief Hossein Ashtari blamed ""enemies"" of Iran for spreading rumors about a quarantine with the aim of causing panic buying and a shortage of essential goods.

The government's opposition to lockdown measures stems partly from fears over the potential damage to a fragile economy, which has been the source of recent unrest. As U.S. sanctions have hammered Iran's economy, domestic tourism -- particularly to religious sites -- has provided a lifeline.

The Coronavirus Pandemic: U.S. Tries to Soften Impact of Coronavirus

Cities, states and Washington sought ways to mitigate the blow of the coronavirus as businesses closed, the European Union planned to shut its borders and fears of a pandemic-induced recession kept markets on edge.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is pitching Senate Republicans on a $1 trillion stimulus plan that would include roughly $250 billion in direct payments, according to a White House official. The Federal Reserve also took steps to prevent further strains in short-term commercial debt markets. The moves helped push U.S. stocks higher Tuesday following a punishing selloff a day earlier.

Around the country, disruptions to daily life continued unabated. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he was considering a shelter-in-place order requiring residents to stay at home for a period, while officials in Hoboken, N.J., ordered residents to self-isolate. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott activated the state's National Guard as the number of infections there grew and the state reported its first coronavirus-related death. More states, including North Carolina, added restrictions on bars and restaurants.

States including Ohio and Maryland delayed their primary elections. Florida, Illinois and Arizona forged ahead with their contests, but last-minute changes to polling locations caused confusion among some voters.

The coronavirus has now officially spread throughout the entire nation, as West Virginia on Tuesday became the 50th state to disclose it has a confirmed case.

Efforts to slow the virus's impact and spread across the U.S. followed more drastic moves in Europe, where France and other countries pledged billions of euros in immediate aid for businesses and employees hit by the pandemic.

Confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus rose globally to more than 196,600 on Tuesday as the death toll hit 7,893, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

Among the new cases were four players on the NBA's Brooklyn Nets, according to the team. Star player Kevin Durant told The Athletic he was one of them.

The swift increase has set off more lockdowns and travel halts.

The EU said it would close its borders for 30 days -- an unprecedented move. The travel ban will allow exemptions for citizens and long-term residents or their immediate families returning home; medical staff and others dealing with the coronavirus; diplomats, frontier workers and people transporting goods. The U.K. and Ireland, which share a common travel zone, aren't covered by the measures.

A nationwide lockdown in France took effect Tuesday, following Italy and Spain, where confirmed cases hit 31,506 and 11,309, respectively, Tuesday. Governments in Asia, meanwhile, are limiting visitors from foreign countries as travelers bring a second wave of the new coronavirus to the region.

The United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees, which coordinates refugee flights around the world, said it was pausing all resettlement flights within the next couple of days. The pause will likely mean the U.S. -- which is accepting a record low 18,000 refugees this year -- could end up resettling even fewer people than it had planned.

Infections in the U.S. surpassed 5,850 Tuesday, with at least 97 deaths. The number of cases is expected to increase as testing capabilities expand.

The U.S. military said Tuesday it would open its labs, ready its hospital ships and distribute key medical equipment in response to the growing crisis. The Trump administration announced new steps to increase access to telehealth, allowing patients to reach doctors remotely for care.

In San Francisco, where a legally mandated lockdown went into effect Tuesday, police patrols were light. But citizens mostly appeared to be complying with the edict, which says residents may venture outside only for groceries or medical appointments. Walks and other exercise are also allowed, but not in groups.

When Cathy Bayer left her home in the city's Miraloma Park neighborhood to stock up on groceries, she said she expected to see some form of police presence.

""I was worried if I would be stopped driving down the street, but so far I don't really see anything different,"" Ms. Bayer, a 64-year-old administrator, said as she loaded three bags of groceries into her car.

Notably outdoors were San Francisco's large homeless population, which city officials exempted from the order.

Manufacturers in the U.S. are improvising to keep factories humming as the coronavirus pandemic threatens one of the biggest disruptions in memory to supply chains, staffing and demand. Amazon.com Inc. said it is taking steps to prioritize shipments of medical supplies, household staples and other high-demand products.

Marriott International Inc., the world's largest hotel company, said it is starting to furlough what it expects will be tens of thousands of employees as it ramps up hotel closings. Meanwhile, retailers including Macy's, Foot Locker, Ralph Lauren, Chico's, American Eagle Outfitters and Fossil announced plans to close stores in the U.S. temporarily.

Governments around the globe are enacting more aggressive measures amid fears of the pandemic's spreading economic impact.

France, where the number of confirmed cases rose to more than 7,600, pledged 45 billion euros ($50 billion) in immediate aid for businesses and employees hit by the pandemic. The U.K., Germany and other European countries have also announced assistance measures for businesses.

In Iran, site of the third-worst outbreak in the world behind China and Italy, worshipers defied restrictions on access to holy shrines and mosques, as the country's leaders struggle to stem soaring infection and death rates.
